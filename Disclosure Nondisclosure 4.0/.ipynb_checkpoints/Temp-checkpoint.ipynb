It\\'s been three months and I\\'ve just learned this and am struggling to get passed it.

We agree on exclusivity.\\n\\n4th date she\\'s saying she\\'s in love with me. She was getting texts from a different ex who just moved to town wanting to get coffee or have drinks. She changed his name in her phone to a girls name so I wouldn\\'t \"freak out\". How nice of her. She say\\'s just friends and they\\'re innocent. I halfway believe her. She would move in with me and marry me if I asked her tomorrow. Then I learned she banged a different ex on the night of our first date. Yeah I\\'ve been trying the past month to get beyond this.

      "('abuseinterrupted', 'invah', \"An Adult Child Abuse Survivor's Guide to the Holidays by Gracie Davis (recovered from archive)\", 'My friends, I spent much of this year speaking out to survivors of child sexual, physical and psychological abuse by their parent(s)/family member(s). Though it\\'s really shaky at times to stand up and speak at the podium, whether in real life or in online writing, I have been compelled, more than ever, to say something, anything and everything, to my true Brothers and Sisters who share this awful, soul crushing history.  As my dear friend and the great blogger Deb Roby reminds me, it is my talking year, after all.  (At this moment, I can\\'t find the post where I tell you all about one of my MOs:  I talk less during even numbered years - the quiet year. And, I talk more during the odd numbered years - the talking year.)\\n\\nAnd, as I was compelled to stand in front of an audience of hundreds this past summer to tell you to Forgive Yourself, I am just as driven to present this blog post to all of you who need to learn or remember strategies for coping during the Holidays.  These designated days for family are lovely in theory but outright painful for those of us who have been abused by family and/or adults close to us when we were young. We need to remember that we made it this far and we can go further. The way to do that is to get some help.  I\\'d like to think this list will be helpful.\\n\\nPlease add your own strategies for coping in the comments. Let\\'s share this precious information.  Let\\'s help one another.\\n\\nFriends, these survival strategies have worked for me in the past and will work for me today and at Christmas, Mother\\'s Day, Father\\'s Day, our abusers\\' birthdays, Easter, funerals, weddings - anytime I have to be with my family of origin. I\\'m 54 years old and have been around long enough to sort out what works and what doesn\\'t, so I\\'m giving you my best here, dollins.\\n\\nFirst, and most importantly, this is the primary principle to follow when you\\'re in the presence of perpetrators and their allies:\\n\\n&gt;Remember this always -\\n\\n&gt;DO NOT ABANDON YOURSELF.\\n\\n&gt;I can\\'t say this enough - do not abandon yourself.\\n\\nYou were abandoned as a child. You did not deserve this. No child deserves this. So, as adults, we take care of ourselves as if we are our own precious child. Imagine taking your child-self gently but firmly by their lovely, grubby little hand and getting them out of harm\\'s way. There are many ways to do this whether you are in the presence of perpetrators and their allies (like your own dismissive and scornful siblings who get angry whenever you mention the legacy and source of your pain) or if you\\'re in a place where you may be triggered.\\n\\nThe following is listed in no particular order of importance because it\\'s all important. I respect that some of these ideas may work for you, some may not. As long as you keep that all-encompassing guidance \"Do not abandon yourself\" in mind, you can take it from there.\\n\\nHere we go:\\n\\nRemember who you are TODAY. You are no longer a child. Indeed, there is a hurt child who is alive and well within you. But, now you\\'re an adult who can make choices.  Don\\'t forget, you are an adult and you have power over your life.\\n\\nOne of the choices you can make is to not go to the abusive family\\'s house. You don\\'t have to go. You can tell them you\\'re sick if you can\\'t tell them the actual reason for your absence. It\\'s okay to \"lie\" in this situation if fear keeps you from telling the truth of the matter.  It\\'s not really a lie, though. The abuse was and is responsible for its consequences that you may suffer from - depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder.\\n\\nIf you do \"call in sick\", don\\'t answer the phone if you know your abusive family members are trying to call your cell or land line  To this, I say - thank you, technology, for caller ID. Don\\'t answer the calls from your abusive family members for up to a week. Then, if you must, call back and say you\\'re feeling better. And, when I say\"better\", I mean that you\\'re probably doing great because you didn\\'t spend time with people who were not good to you and continue to be bad to you.\\n\\nIf you have to be with abusive family members, do whatever you need to do to stay centered as you cannot abandon yourself and you need to remember who you are today. \\n\\nStaying centered may involve many tactics:\\n\\nGo to your abuser\\'s house with your real family, your husband, your kids, your chosen family of dear friends who believe in you. If you need support and active reminders of who you are now, take your supportive people with you. These people are your true family members who love you, won\\'t abandon you and remind you of who you are today.\\n\\nThis is a big one - STAY SOBER. I cannot emphasize that enough. If you get drunk or high, you will lose that centered spot. You will relax, that\\'s true, but it\\'s a false sense of ease.  Do take your Xanax if necessary but stick to your prescribed dose. The Bloggess will always recommend that you should avoid knocking back handfuls of the Judy Garland Trail Mix. And, there you go, a little Bloggess humor for you on a tough day. \\n\\nHelp in the kitchen. Be involved with the preparation. Do this only if such activities are not triggering. I always do this. I put my head down and work. I set the table, I do the dishes, I cook. I put my head down and work it, like a Zen monk whose practice includes performing chores mindfully. That\\'s an excellent way to stay centered, pretending to be a Zen monk and doing tasks wholeheartedly.\\n\\nSit by a window so you can look outside. When you pull in the outside world as you sit with those who abandoned you, the world becomes that much bigger. There\\'s more out there, beyond the dark cave of the abuser\\'s house. \\n\\nGo beyond looking out the window and get out there in that bigger world. Expand your universe. The abuser\\'s house or the house with the abusers in it is not the core of the world. The world is beyond that house. In this world there are people who believe in you and love you unconditionally. That world contains your working life where you are valued or perhaps your university studies where you excel. So, go outside for a few minutes and take a walk in the bigger world.\\n\\nPut your therapist\\'s number on fast dial. Call anytime. Even if you reach their voice mail, leave a message. Don\\'t fret if they don\\'t call back. Instead, revel in the knowledge that you were wise enough to reach out. You asked for help and that action alone is therapeutic.\\n\\nKeeping your therapist in mind, remember the tricks and tools they have suggested to help you through these tough times. For example, I like to use what all of my therapists taught me -  the classic meditation exercise of sitting comfortably and going to my inner place of refuge. FYI - it\\'s a beach on the Big Island of Hawaii. Not bad, eh?\\n\\nMinimize conversation with the perpetrator and anyone who has been abusive to you. Again, you can say you\\'re not feeling well, you have a headache, you need to be quiet. And, again, you ain\\'t lying here. That person makes you feel unwell and your head probably hurts when you\\'re around them.\\n\\nIf you cannot avoid conversations with those people, keep something in your pocket to remind yourself of who you are today. I use a little plastic monkey from the Barrel of Monkeys toy-game. Small and with a defined shape, the monkey reminds me of the relative light heartedness of my life away from the abusers. Also, a monkey is not to be messed with and you can pretend the monkey is throwing feces at whoever needs to be taken down.\\n\\nYou can also keep your cell phone on to Twitter, Facebook or chat or whatever you use for social media interactions. Set it to buzz everytime you get an update. Another reminder of the bigger world out there and that you\\'re part of that bigger, better world.\\n\\nOkay, get ready for this big one, survivors:\\n\\nRemembering you are an adult of legal age, Walk out the door the second things get gnarly. Just go.\\n\\nEveryone, no matter how badaas and brave they seem to be, is scared shitless to do this.  I was scared to do this. But, I\\'ve done it and I\\'ll do it again if I need to  because it felt exhilarating, liberating and life affirming.\\n\\nDon\\'t leave yelling, but if you do, try to cry, yell some more or laugh really hard once you\\'re out the door to release what is truly an emotional atomic bomb full of energy. Really try to do that before you get in the car. Do not drive home in an intense emotional state as you are not centered and in control. Respect your anger and anguish and give it time to release and subside. You will feel better and that will help you think clearly as you operate that moving vehicle.\\n\\nOnce you\\'re back home, take a long, hot shower or bath. Put on clean sweats or pajamas, rev up the TV and watch football or, better yet, that really cool and amazing CNN special about heroes. \\n\\nDo upbeat things. Listen to music. \\n\\nI\\'ll end here with a [visual command](http://web.archive.org/web/20100505232029/http://gracedavis.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c803253ef0120a6de1115970b-pi) from me:\\n\\n**You can do it. Yes, you can.**\\n\\nTake good care today and on every holiday, my brothers and sisters. \"Take to the sky,\" dollins.\\n\\nAnd yes, please tell us, share what you do to get through the holidays. \\n\\nPeaceful, warm and blessed Thanksgiving Day to all of you, my good readers.

She had bought a house about 6 months ago and I moved in with her and her daughter. She isn't very financially sound but, I agreed to pay her 600 in 'rent' every month which was about half the bills. We never had any formal agreement (legally), I just said I would pay that.\\n\\nI had moved all my stuff in and helped pay for a lot of other stuff around the house also, which probably amounted in the thousands.\\n\\nWe got into a 'fight' on a Friday a couple weeks ago and she asked me to move out. I did, I went to my parents with some stuff.\\nWe officially broke up last week Wednesday (28th). I asked her then when she wanted me to move my stuff, she said whenever or whenever I get my own place. Then after I think realizing we weren't getting back together she said ASAP. I then asked her a good time and she said she wanted to be there and have the child not there...Which limits it to every other weekend (which the breakup made it fall on an 'on' weekend with the child) and Wednesday nights for a couple hours.\\n\\nI told her I was just going to take all my stuff last night and then Saturday morning. She then asked for my 600 for rent since my stuff wasn't gone. She then complained how she didn't plan for this and didn't have any money so I need to pay her. I rebuffed that and she backed off.\\n\\nI also pay for the Internet in the house and wanted to get that switched, but I would need to cancel and pay the whole fee of 200+, which I didn't want to do. The ex wanted to get her own to bundle and save money. I offered a compromise and offered to pay for the Internet until I get a house then pay her what she would have saved. She was then asking for the 600 AGAIN and said my stuff is still there and any other landlord would make me pay for another month. I was then just sure I was going to just cancel it and say screw it.\\n\\nWhat makes it more complicated is we got a dog (Her idea 100%) but she hates the dog and I love it. I wanted the dog, but don't have a place for it right now though, so she is keeping it for now.\\n\\nShe seems to be going downhill saying that she could just change the locks and make sure I can't get in (which I am sure she would do)\\n\\nI am now planning on getting my stuff out tomorrow afternoon while she is at work, but can't get the dog out. \\n\\nAny advice on what I can do?

       " \"My friend recently told me she was abused as a child.  What should I do? Since school began last September, I noticed my friend hasn't been herself.  There were a few other things that she had done that weren't like her that my friends had told me about, and that really added to the fact that she was being very different.  Recently I confronted her on it and she told me she couldn't tell me in person so we messaged over facebook.\\n\\nA few months ago a friend of hers committed suicide, and that contributed to it, but she also said that something else was bugging her.  She came out and told me that as a child she had been molested by her aunt's husband.  From when she was 3 until 8 years old, he would  touch her and I am the only person she has ever told.  I've known her since we were five, and when we were about 10 she wanted to tell me, but decided against it.  The uncle and aunt recently got divorced so I don't think she sees him any more.  She was reminded of it because her cousin turned 3 this past September.  She said she got over it, but it's obviously come back and it will continue to affect her.\\n\\nWhat should I do?  It's been about a month since I talked to her about it.  The abuse isn't still happening so it's not like it will stop it, but this man could easily do it to another little girl, such as her cousin.  I want to help my friend and talk to her about it again, but I don't know what to say.  I don't know his name so I can't report it, and she made me promise not to tell her parents.  If I need to though, I will, but she said her dad would find and kill the man (I don't doubt it either).\\n\\nPlease, could anyone give me advice on how to help?  Did anyone have a similar experience in telling their friends or someone telling them?\",\n",

The stranger said that if I push the device, the world will end, but would be back after one year if I didn\\'t decide to press it in order to collect the device, and then just disappeared. I laughed about it and was about to throw it out before a crazy thought came to my head. What if it was true? Wouldn\\'t that make me all powerful? I decided to have some fun and do a social experiment. I\\'ve been super happy a lot of times, but I\\'ve never been in love. I posted on all the major social media sites about the device I had, and that if any girl could show me what it felt like to be in love within a year, I wouldn\\'t destroy the world. This was pretty much a huge joke. Even though it was a joke, no one contacted me. At first I didn\\'t make a big deal of it, but slowly I began to become more cynical. Was no one at least curious about the situation and wanted to talk to me about it? A year passed by, and I was sitting on a park bench, when the random stranger appeared. He asked me if I made my decision. I just sat there and thought about it. Could I look seven billion plus people in the face and say, \"I\\'m sorry, but you died because of me\"? Who was I to judge anyone? I ended up pressing the button and handing it back to him, thinking this was somehow a test of my character. All of a sudden everything started to tremble and people began screaming. The first thing I felt was sadness that I destroyed the world, but more so, it was the sadness that I had lost faith in humanity; that I could love persons, but hate people. That\\'s when I woke up super confused and sad.',\n",
