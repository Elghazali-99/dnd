<p>Conceptually, I would like to accomplish the following but have had trouble understand how to code it properly in C#:</p>

<pre><code>
SomeMethod { // Member of AClass{}
    DoSomething;
    Start WorkerMethod() from BClass in another thread;
    DoSomethingElse;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, when WorkerMethod() is complete, run this:</p>

<p><pre><code>
void SomeOtherMethod()  // Also member of AClass{}
{ ... }
</pre></code></p>

<p>Can anyone please give an example of that? </p>
