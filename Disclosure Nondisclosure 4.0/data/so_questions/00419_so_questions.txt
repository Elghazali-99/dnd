<p>I am considering log-shipping of <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/runtime-config-wal.html">Write Ahead Logs (WAL)</a> in PostgreSQL to create a warm-standby database. However I have one table in the database that receives a huge amount of INSERT/DELETEs each day, but which I don't care about protecting the data in it. To reduce the amount of WALs produced I was wondering, <strong>is there a way to prevent any activity on one table from being recorded in the WALs?</strong></p>
