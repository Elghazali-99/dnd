<p>If you have a statically allocated array, the Visual Studio debugger can easily display all of the array elements.  However, if you have an array allocated dynamically and pointed to by a pointer, it will only display the first element of the array when you click the + to expand it.  Is there an easy way to tell the debugger, show me this data as an array of type Foo and size X?</p>
