<p>The first time I load the website in the production web server, it start very slow, subsequent pages load very quickly (included the home page).</p>

<p>I precompiled the site, but nothing changes. </p>

<p>I don't have any code at Application start.
I don't have cached items.</p>

<p>Any ideas? How can I find out what is happening?</p>
