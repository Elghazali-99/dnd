<p>We all know T-SQL's string manipulation capabilities sometimes leaves much to be desired...</p>

<p>I have a numeric field that needs to be output in T-SQL as a right-aligned text column. Example:</p>

<pre><code>Value
----------
   143.55
  3532.13
     1.75
</code></pre>

<p>How would you go about that? A good solution ought to be clear and compact, but remember there is such a thing as "too clever".</p>

<p>I agree this is the wrong place to do this, but sometimes we're stuck by forces outside our control.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
