<p>Has anyone ever written a function that can convert all of the controls on an aspx page into a read only version?  For example, if UserDetails.aspx is used to edit and save a users information, if someone with inappropriate permissions enter the page, I would like to render it as read-only.  So, most controls would be converted to labels, loaded with the corresponding data from the editable original control.</p>

<p>I think it would likely be a fairly simple routine, ie:  </p>

<pre><code>Dim ctlParent As Control = Me.txtTest.Parent  
Dim ctlOLD As TextBox = Me.txtTest  
Dim ctlNEW As Label = New Label  
ctlNEW.Width = ctlOLD.Width  
ctlNEW.Text = ctlOLD.Text  
ctlParent.Controls.Remove(ctlOLD)  
ctlParent.Controls.Add(ctlNEW)
</code></pre>

<p>...is really all you need for a textbox --> label conversion, but I was hoping someone might know of an existing function out there as there are likely a few pitfalls here and there with certain controls and situations.</p>

<p>Update:<br />
- Just setting the ReadOnly property to true is not a viable solution, as it looks dumb having things greyed out like that.
- Avoiding manually creating a secondary view is the entire point of this, so using an ingenious way to display a read only version of the user interface that was built by hand using labels is wat I am trying to avoid.</p>

<p>Thanks!!</p>
