<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisample_anti-aliasing" rel="nofollow">Multisampling</a></strong> is a way of applying <strong>full screen anti-aliasing</strong> (FSAA) in 3D applications. I need to use multisampling in my OpenGL program, which is currently embedded in a <strong>wxWidgets</strong> GUI. Is there a way to do this? Please respond only if you know the detailed steps to achieve this.</p>

<p>I'm aware of enabling multisampling using <strong><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537544%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">WGL</a></strong> (Win32 extensions to OpenGL). However, since my OpenGL program isn't written in MFC (and I want the code to be multi-platform portable), that's not an option for me.</p>
