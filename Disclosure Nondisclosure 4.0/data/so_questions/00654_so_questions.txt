<p>I have been writing Flex applications for a few months now and luckily have not needed a full debugger as of yet, so far I have just used a few Alert boxes...</p>

<p>Is there an available debugger that is included in the free Flex SDK? I am not using FlexBuilder (I have been using Emacs and compiling with ant).</p>

<p>If not, how do you debug Flex applications without FlexBuilder? (note: I have no intentions of using flexbuilder)</p>
