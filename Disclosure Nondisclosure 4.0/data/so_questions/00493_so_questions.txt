<p>I have been told that there is a performance difference between the following code blocks.</p>

<pre><code>foreach (Entity e in entityList)
{
 ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>for (int i=0; i&lt;entityList.Count; i++)
{
   Entity e = (Entity)entityList[i];
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>where</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Entity&gt; entityList;
</code></pre>

<p>I am no CLR expect but from what I can tell they should boil down to basically the same code.  Does anybody have concrete (heck, I'd take packed dirt) evidence one way or the other?</p>
