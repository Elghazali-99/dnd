<p>In my current job the supervisor's practice is to only check in production ready code.  Most recently the project I was on involved work by 3 different developers with some file overlap.  This meant manually integrating changes despite the fact that some changes took a day and then it was done.  I wanted to see if this was a common practice and get suggestions on how to change this practice with the knowledge that many times my opinion means little in the grand scheme of things.</p>
