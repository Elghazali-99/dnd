<p>In most C or C++ environments, there is a "debug" mode and a "release" mode compilation.<br />
Looking at the difference between the two, you find that the debug mode adds the debug symbols (often the -g option on lots of compilers) but it also disables most optimizations.<br />
In "release" mode, you usually have all sorts of optimizations turned on.<br />
Why the difference?</p>
