<p>GNU sed version 4.1.5 seems to fail with International chars. Here is my input file:</p>

<p>Gras Och Stenar Trad - From Moja to Minneapolis DVD [G2007DVD] 7812 | X
<br>
Gras Och Stenar Trad - From MÃ¶ja to Minneapolis DVD [G2007DVD] 7812 | Y</p>

<p>(Note the umlaut in second line.)</p>

<p>And when I do</p>

<p>sed 's/.*| //' &lt; in</p>

<p>I would expect to see only the X and Y, as I've asked to remove ALL chars up to the '|' and space beyond it. Instead, I get:</p>

<p>X<br>
Gras Och Stenar Trad - From M? Y</p>

<p>I know I can use tr to remove the International chars. first, but is there a way to just use sed?</p>
