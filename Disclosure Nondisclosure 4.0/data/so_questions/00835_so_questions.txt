<p>I took a data structures class in C++ last year, and consequently implemented all the major data structures in templated code.  I saved it all on a flash drive because I have a feeling that at some point in my life, I'll use it again.  I imagine <em>something</em> I end up programming will need a B-Tree, or is that just delusional?  How long do you typically save the code you write for possible reuse?         </p>
