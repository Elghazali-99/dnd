<p>I have a class in system-C with some data members as such:  </p>

<pre><code>long double x[8];
</code></pre>

<p>I'm initializing it in the construction like this:</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 8; ++i) {
    x[i] = 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But the first time I use it in my code I have garbage there.</p>

<p>Because of the way the system is built I can't connect a debugger easily.  Are there any methods to set a data breakpoint in the code so that it tells me where in the code the variables were actually changed, but without hooking up a debugger?</p>

<p>Edit:

Actually, this is a typo in the <em>question</em>, but not in my code...  Thanks!</p>
