<p>I want to get started on HMM's, but don't know how to go about it. Can people here, give me some basic pointers, where to look?</p>

<p>More than just the theory, I like to do a lot of hands-on. So, would prefer resources, where I can write small code snippets to check my learning, rather than just dry text.</p>
