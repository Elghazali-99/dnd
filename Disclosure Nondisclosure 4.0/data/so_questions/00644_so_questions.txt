<p>I'm quite confident that globally declared variables get allocated (and initialized, if applicable) at program start time.</p>

<pre><code>int globalgarbage;
unsigned int anumber = 42;
</code></pre>

<p>But what about static ones defined within a function?</p>

<pre><code>void doSomething()
{
  static bool globalish = true;
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>When is the space for <code>globalish</code> allocated? I'm guessing when the program starts. But does it get initialized then too? Or is it initialized when <code>doSomething()</code> is first called?</p>
