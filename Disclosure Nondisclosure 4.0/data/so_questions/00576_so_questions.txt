<p>I grew up learning to code based on what I've experienced with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demoscene</a>.  It seems to be a pretty sparse subculture in the US.  How many developers watch or participate in the scene?</p>

<p>Teaser: If you haven't checked out the scene before, take a look at one of my favorites: <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=30244">Debris</a> by Farbrausch.  Watch on <a href="http://demoscene.tv/page.php?id=172&amp;lang=uk&amp;vsmaction=view_prod&amp;id_prod=12909">demoscene.tv</a> or download the <a href="http://www.scene.org/file.php?file=/parties/2007/breakpoint07/demo/fr-041_debris.zip&amp;fileinfo">app</a> (179k) and run it yourself.  No video, all realtime rendering and audio.  Think, a small group of guys wrote this for a competition on their free time.</p>
