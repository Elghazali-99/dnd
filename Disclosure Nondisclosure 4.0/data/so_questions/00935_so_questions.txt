<p>I am writing some code to see if there is a hole in the firewall exception list for <strong>WinXP</strong> and <strong>Vista</strong> for a specific port used by our client software. </p>

<p>I can see that I can use the <code>NetFwMgr.LocalPolicy.CurrentProfile.GloballyOpenPorts</code> to get a list of the current Open port exceptions.  But i can not figure out how to get that enumerated list in to something that I can use in my Delphi program. </p>

<p>My latest try is listed below. It's giving me an access violation when I use <code>port_list.Item</code>. I know that's wrong, it was mostly wishful thinking on my part. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<pre><code>function TFirewallUtility.IsPortInExceptionList(iPortNumber: integer): boolean;
var
  i, h: integer;
  port_list, port: OleVariant;
begin
  Result := False;
  port_list := mxFirewallManager.LocalPolicy.CurrentProfile.GloballyOpenPorts;
  for i := 0 to port_list.Count - 1 do
  begin
    port := port_list.Item[i];
    if (port.PortNumber = iPortNumber) then
    begin
      Result := True;
      break;
    end;
  end;
end;
</code></pre>
