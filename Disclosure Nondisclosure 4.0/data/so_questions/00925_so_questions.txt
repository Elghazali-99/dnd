<p>As developers and as professional engineers have you been exposed to the tenants of Extreme Programming as defined in the "version 1" by Kent Beck.
Which of those 12 core principles do you feel you have been either allowed to practice or at least be a part of in your current job or others?</p>

<pre><code>* Pair programming[5]
* Planning game
* Test driven development
* Whole team (being empowered to deliver)
* Continuous integration
* Refactoring or design improvement
* Small releases
* Coding standards
* Collective code ownership
* Simple design
* System metaphor
* Sustainable pace
</code></pre>

<p>From an engineers point of view I feel that the main engineering principles of XP arevastly superior to anything else I have been involved in. What is your opinion?</p>
