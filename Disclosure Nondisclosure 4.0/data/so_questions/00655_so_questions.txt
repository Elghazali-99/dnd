<p>I'm creating an ASP.NET web site where all pages hang off a database-driven tree-hierarchy.  Pages typically present HTML content.  But, some will execute programming.</p>

<p>Examples: (1) a "contact us" form or (2) a report generator</p>

<p>How should I represent/reference the programming within the database?  Should I have a varchar value of a Web User Control (.ascx) name?  Or a Web Form (.aspx) name?  Something else?  Or should it just be an integer or other such ID in a dictionary within my application?</p>

<p>Can I make an ASP.NET Site Map Provider with this structure?</p>
