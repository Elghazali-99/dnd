<p>I need a function called SizeOfPipe() which should return the size of a pipe- I only want to know how much data is in the pipe and not actually read data off the pipe itself. </p>

<p>I thought the following code would work</p>

<pre><code>fseek (pPipe, 0 , SEEK_END);
*pBytes = ftell (pPipe);
rewind (pPipe);
</code></pre>

<p>but fseek dosent work on file descriptors. Another option would be to read the pipe then write the data back but would like to avoid this if possibe, any suggestions ?</p>
