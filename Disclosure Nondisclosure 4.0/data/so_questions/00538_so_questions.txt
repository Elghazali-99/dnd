<p>i have a wcf service that does an operation. and in this operation there could be a fault. i have stated that there could be a fault in my service contract. </p>

<p>here is the code below;</p>

<pre><code>public void Foo()
{
        try
        {
            DoSomething(); // throws FaultException&lt;FooFault&gt;
        }
        catch (FaultException)
        {
            throw;
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            myProject.Exception.Throw&lt;FooFault&gt;(ex);
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>in service contract;</p>

<pre><code>[FaultException(typeof(FooFault))]
void Foo();
</code></pre>

<p>when a FaultException was thrown by DoSomething() method while i was running the application, firstly the exception was caught at "catch(Exception ex)" line and breaks in there. then when i pressed f5 again, it does what normally it has to. i wonder why that break exists? and if not could it be problem on publish?</p>
