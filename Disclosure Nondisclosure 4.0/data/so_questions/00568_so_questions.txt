<p>This has been driving me crazy for a few days.  Why doesn't the following work?</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>    Dim arr(3, 3) As Integer

    For y As Integer = 0 To arr.GetLength(0) - 1
        For x As Integer = 0 To arr.GetLength(y) - 1
            arr(y, x) = y + x
        Next
    Next
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, what if the array looked like this instead?</p>

<pre><code>{ {1, 2, 3},
  {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9},
  {5, 4, 3, 2}
}
</code></pre>
