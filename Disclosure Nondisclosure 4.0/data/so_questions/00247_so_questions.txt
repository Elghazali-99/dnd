<p>Which is better to use in PHP, a 2D array or a class? I've included an example of what I mean by this.</p>

<pre><code>// Using a class
class someClass
{
    public  $name;
    public  $height;
    public  $weight;

    function __construct($name, $height, $weight)
    {
        $this -&gt; name       = $name;
        $this -&gt; height = $height;
        $this -&gt; weight = $weight;
    }
}

$classArray[1] = new someClass('Bob', 10, 20);
$classArray[2] = new someClass('Fred', 15, 10);
$classArray[3] = new someClass('Ned', 25, 30);


// Using a 2D array
$normalArray[1]['name'] = 'Bob';
$normalArray[1]['height']   = 10;
$normalArray[1]['weight']   = 20;

$normalArray[2]['name'] = 'Fred';
$normalArray[2]['height']   = 15;
$normalArray[2]['weight']   = 10;

$normalArray[3]['name'] = 'Ned';
$normalArray[3]['height']   = 25;
$normalArray[3]['weight']   = 30;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Assuming that somebody doesn't come out and show that classes are too slow, it looks like class wins.</p>

<p>I've not idea which answer I should accept to I've just upvoted all of them.</p>

<hr>

<p>And I have now written two near identical pages, one using the 2D array (written before this question was posted) and now one using a class and I must say that the class produces much nicer code. I have no idea how much overhead is going to be generated but I doubt it will rival the improvement to the code itself.</p>

<p>Thank you for helping to make me a better programmer.</p>
