</blockquote>



<p>I'd like to have multiple global hotkeys in my new app (to control the app from anywhere in windows), and all of the given sources/solutions I found on the web seem to provide with a sort of a limping solution (either solutions only for one g.hotkey, or solutions that while running create annoying mouse delays on the screen).</p>

<p>Does anyone here know of a resource that can help me achive this, that I can learn from?
Anything?</p>

<p>Thanks !  :)</p>
