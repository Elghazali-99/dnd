<p>I am new to TDD (Test Driven Development).</p>

<p>First of all, is it even possible to unit test Windows Service?</p>

<p>Windows service class is derived from ServiceBase, which has overridable methods, </p>

<ol>
<li>OnStart </li>
<li>OnStop</li>
</ol>

<p>How can I trigger those methods to be called as if unit test is an actual service that calls those methods in proper order?</p>

<p>At this point, am I even doing a Unit testing? or an Integration test?</p>

<p>I have looked at WCF service question but it didn't make any sense to me since I have never dealt with WCF service.</p>
