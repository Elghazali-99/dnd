<p>I have a <code>Rakefile</code> with a Rake task that I would normally call from the command line:</p>

<pre><code>rake blog:post Title
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to write a Ruby script that calls that Rake task multiple times, but the only solution I see is shelling out using `` (backticks) or <code>system</code>.</p>

<p>What's the right way to do this?</p>
