<p>I have a custom installer action that updates the PATH environment, and creates an additional environment variable. Appending a directory to the existing path variable is working fine, but for some reason my attempts to create a new environment variable have been unsuccessful. The code I am using is:</p>

<pre><code>        using (RegistryKey reg = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey(@"SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment", true))
        {
            reg.SetValue("MYVAR", "SomeVal", RegistryValueKind.ExpandString);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: The OS is 32-bit XP, and as far as I can tell it is failing silently.</p>
