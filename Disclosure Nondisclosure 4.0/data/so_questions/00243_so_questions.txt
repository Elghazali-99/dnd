<p>I want to see all the different ways you can come up with, for a factorial subroutine, or program. The hope is that anyone can come here and see if they might want to learn a new language.</p>

<h2>Ideas:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Procedural</li>
<li>Functional</li>
<li>Object Oriented</li>
<li>One liners</li>
<li>Obfuscated</li>
<li>Oddball</li>
<li>Bad Code</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_%28computing%29" rel="nofollow">Polyglot</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Basically I want to see an example, of different ways of writing an algorithm, and what they would look like in different languages.</p>

<p>Please limit it to one example per entry.
I will allow you to have more than one example per answer, if you are trying to highlight a specific style, language, or just a well thought out idea that lends itself to being in one post.</p>

<p>The only real requirement is it must find the factorial of a given argument, in all languages represented.</p>

<h2>Recommended Guideline:</h2>

<pre>
# Language Name: Optional Style type

   - Optional bullet points

<p>I will ocasionally go along and edit any answer that does not have decent formatting.</p>
