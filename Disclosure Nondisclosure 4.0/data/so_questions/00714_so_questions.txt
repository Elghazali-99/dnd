<p>I've just coded a 700 line class. Awful. I hang my head in shame.  It's as opposite to DRY as a British summer.</p>

<p>It's full of cut and paste with minor tweaks here and there.  This makes it's a prime candidate for refactoring.  Before I embark on this, I'd thought I'd ask when you have lots of repetition, what are the first refactoring opportunities you look for?</p>

<p>For the record, mine are probably using:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generic classes and methods</li>
<li>Method overloading/chaining.</li>
</ol>

<p>What are yours?</p>
