<p>I'm getting this problem:</p>

<pre><code>PHP Warning: mail() [function.mail]: SMTP server response: 550 5.7.1 Unable to relay for chris.mahan@gmail.com in c:\inetpub\wwwroot\mailtest.php on line 12 
</code></pre>

<p>from this script:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$to = "chris.mahan@gmail.com";
$subject = "test";
$body = "this is a test";

if (mail($to, $subject, $body)){
    echo "mail sent";
}
else {
    echo "problem";
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>section from php.ini on the server:</p>

<pre><code>[mail function]
; For Win32 only.
SMTP = server.domain.com; for Win32 only
smtp_port = 25

; For Win32 only.
sendmail_from = support@domain.com
; For Unix only.  You may supply arguments as well (default: "sendmail -t -i").
;sendmail_path =
</code></pre>

<p>(note that "server" and "domain" refer accurately to the actual server and domain name)</p>

<p>In IIS, SMTP is running. Under <code>"Access"</code> tab, <code>"Relay"</code> button, the Select which computers may relay through this virtual server is set to <code>checkbox "only the list below"</code> and on the list is <code>"127.0.0.1(xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)" (x's representing actual server IP address).</code></p>

<p>Server is running <code>Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2</code>, fully patched as of 5 PM Sept 1st 2008. I assume it is running <code>IIS7</code> (how to check?).</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>In reponse to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2257/espo">Espo</a>: This machine is hosted at a datacenter. We do not want to use a gmail account (were doing it, want to move away from that). Windows server 2003 comes with its own SMTP server.</p>

<p>Update: Per Yaakov Ellis' advice, I dropped all relay restrictions and added the server  IP to the allowed list (using the reverse DNS button provided) and the thing started working.</p>

<p>Thanks to both Espo and Yaakov for helping me out.</p>
