<p>Admittedly this might not be a problem on larger screens, but my employer is abit tight and refuses to buy monitors larger than 19inch, this means that I dont have much screen real estate to view all the Visual Studio windows and my code at the same time, or two pieces of code at once. Is there anything that allows me to detach the code panels so that I can view two different classes at once on each of my screens? </p>
