<p>I ran into an issue with an IIS web app shutting down an idle worker process.  The next request would then have to re-initialize the application, leading to delays.  I disabled the IIS shutdown of idle worker processes on the application pool to resolve this.  Are there any issues associated with turning this off?  If the process is leaking memory, I imagine it is nice to recycle the process every now and then.  Are there any other benefits to having this process shutdown?</p>
