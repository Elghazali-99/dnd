<p>With VMWare Server running under Linux (Debain), I would like to have the following setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>1st: NIC being used by many of the
images running under VMWare, as well
as being used by the Linux OS </li>
<li>2nd: NIC being used by only 1 image and to be unused by the Linux OS (as its part of a DMZ)</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the second NIC won't be used by Linux, it is certainly recognised as a NIC (e.g. eth1).</p>

<p>Is this possible under VMWare Server, and if so, is it as simple as not binding eth1 under Linux and then bridging it to the image under VMWare Server?</p>
