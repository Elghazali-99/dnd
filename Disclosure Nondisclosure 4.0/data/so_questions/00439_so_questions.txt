<p>In python one can get a dictionary of all local and global variables in the current scope with the built-in functions locals() and globals().  Is there some equivalent way of doing this in javascript?  For instance, I would like to do something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = function(){ alert('foo'); };
var bar = function(){ alert('bar'); };

var s = 'foo';
locals()[s](); // alerts 'foo'
</code></pre>

<p>Is this at all possible, or should I just be using a local object for the lookup?</p>
