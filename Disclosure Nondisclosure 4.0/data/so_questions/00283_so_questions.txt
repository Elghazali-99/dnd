<p>On my Vista machine I cannot install the .Net framework 3.5 SP1. Setup ends few moments after ending the download of the required files, stating in the log that: </p>

<pre><code>[08/26/08,09:46:11] Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0SP1 (CBS): [2] Error: Installation failed for component Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0SP1 (CBS). MSI returned error code 1
[08/26/08,09:46:13] WapUI: [2] DepCheck indicates Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0SP1 (CBS) is not installed.
</code></pre>

<p>First thing I did was trying to install 2.0 SP1, but this time setup states that the "product is not supported on Vista system". Uhm.</p>

<p>The real big problem is that this setup fails also when it is called by the Visual Studio 2008 SP1.</p>

<p>Now, I searched the net for this, but I'm not finding a real solution... Any idea / hint? Did anybody have problems during SP1 install?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
