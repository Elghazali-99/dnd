<p>I am working on a Customer Server Control that extends another control.  There is no problem with attaching to other controls on the form.</p>

<p>in vb.net:  Parent.FindControl(TargetControlName)</p>

<p>I would like to pass a method to the control in the ASPX markup. </p>

<p>for example: &lt;c:MyCustomerControl runat=server InitializeStuffCallback="InitializeStuff"&gt;</p>

<p>So, I tried using reflection to access the given method name from the Parent.</p>

<p>Something like (in VB)</p>

<pre><code>Dim pageType As Type = Page.GetType
Dim CallbackMethodInfo As MethodInfo = pageType.GetMethod( "MethodName" )

'Also tried 
sender.Parent.GetType.GetMethod("MethodName")
sender.Parent.Parent.GetType.GetMethod("MethodName")
</code></pre>

<p>The method isn't found, because it just isn't apart of the Page.  Where should I be looking?  I'm fairly sure this is possible because I've seen other controls do similar.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>I forgot to mention, my work-around is to give the control events and attaching to them in the Code-behind.</p>
