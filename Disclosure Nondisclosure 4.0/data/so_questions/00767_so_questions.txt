<p>I work with embedded Linux systems that sometimes want to get their IP address from a DHCP server.  The DHCP Client client we use (<a href="http://www.phystech.com/download/dhcpcd.html" rel="nofollow" title="DHCPCD">dhcpcd</a>) has limited retry logic.  If our device starts up without any DHCP server available and times out, dhcpcd will exit and the device will never get an IP address until it's rebooted with a DHCP server visible/connected.  I can't be the only one that has this problem.  The problem doesn't even seem to be specific to embedded systems (though it's worse there).  How do you handle this?  Is there a more robust client available?  </p>
