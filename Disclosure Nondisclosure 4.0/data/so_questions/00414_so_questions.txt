<p>What is the best way to implement, from a web page a download action using asp.net 2.0?</p>

<p>Log files for a action are created in a directory called [Application Root]/Logs.  I have the full path and want to provide a button, that when clicked will download the log file from the IIS server to the users local pc.</p>
