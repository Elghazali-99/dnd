<p>Please, now that I've re-written the question, and before it suffers from further <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/56103/fastest-gun-in-the-west-problem" rel="nofollow">fast-gun answers</a> or premature closure by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/905/keith" rel="nofollow">eager editors</a> let me point out that this is not a duplicate of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9673/remove-duplicates-from-array" rel="nofollow">this question</a>.  I know how to remove duplicates from an array.</p>

<p>This question is about removing <strong>sequences</strong> from an array, not duplicates in the strict sense.</p>

<p>Consider this sequence of elements in an array;</p>

<pre><code>[0] a
[1] a
[2] b
[3] c
[4] c
[5] a
[6] c
[7] d
[8] c
[9] d
</code></pre>

<p>In this example I want to obtain the following...</p>

<pre><code>[0] a
[1] b
[2] c
[3] a
[4] c
[5] d
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that duplicate elements are retained but that sequences of the same element have been reduced to a single instance of that element.</p>

<p>Further, notice that when two lines repeat they should be reduced to one set (of two lines).</p>

<pre><code>[0] c
[1] d
[2] c
[3] d
</code></pre>

<p>...reduces to...</p>

<pre><code>[0] c
[1] d
</code></pre>

<p>I'm coding in C# but algorithms in any language appreciated.</p>
