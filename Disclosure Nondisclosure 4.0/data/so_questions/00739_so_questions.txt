<p>I know that tables are for tabular data, but it's so tempting to use them for layout. I can handle DIV's to get a three column layout, but when you got 4 nested DIV's, it get tricky. </p>

<p>Is there a tutorial/reference out there to persuade me to use DIV's for layout?</p>

<p>I want to use DIV's, but I refuse to spend an hour to position my DIV/SPAN where I want it.</p>
