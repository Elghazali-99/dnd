<p>I know that garbage collection is automated in Java. But I understood that if you write <code>System.gc()</code> in your code the Java VM may or may not decide at runtime to do a garbage collection at that point. How does this work precisely? On what basis/parameters exactly does the VM decide to do (or not do) a GC when it sees a <code>System.gc()</code>? Are there maybe examples in which case it <strong>is</strong> a good idea to put this in your code?</p>
