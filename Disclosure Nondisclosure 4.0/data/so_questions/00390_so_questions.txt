<p>I am starting to use Python (specifically because of Django) and I would like to remove the burden for exhaustive testing by performing some static analysis.  What tools/parameters/etc. exist to detect issues at compile time that would otherwise show up during runtime? (type errors are probably the most obvious case of this, but undefined variables are another big one that could be avoided with an in-depth analysis of the AST.)</p>

<p>Obviously testing is important, and I don't imply that tests can be obviated entirely; however, there are many runtime errors in python that are not possible in other languages that perform stricter run-time checking -- I'm hoping that there are tools to bring at least some of these capabilities to python as well.</p>
