<p>I've tried using source control for a couple projects but still don't really understand it.  For these projects, we've used TortoiseSVN and have only had one line of revisions.  (No trunk, branch, or any of that.)  If there is a recommended way to set up source control systems, what are they?  What are the reasons and benifits for setting it up that way?  What is the underlying differences between the workings of a centralized and distributed source control system?</p>
