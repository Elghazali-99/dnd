<p>What is the best, preferably free/open source tool for auto-generating Java unit-tests? I know, the unit-tests cannot really serve the same purpose as normal TDD Unit-Tests which document and drive the design of the system. However auto-generated unit-tests can be useful if you have a huge legacy codebase and want to know whether the changes you are required to make will have unwanted, obscure side-effects.</p>
