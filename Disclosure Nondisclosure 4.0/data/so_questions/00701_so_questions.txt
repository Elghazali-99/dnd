<p>I have a wildcard subdomain enabled and dynamically parse the URL by passing it as-is to my <code>index.php</code> (ex. <code>somecity.domain.com</code>).  </p>

<p>Now, I wish to create a few subdomains that are static where I can install different application and not co-mingle with my current one (ex. <code>blog.domain.com</code>).</p>

<p>My <code>.htaccess</code> currently reads:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</code></pre>

<p>Can I manipulate this <code>.htaccess</code> to achieve what I need? Can it be done through Apache?</p>
