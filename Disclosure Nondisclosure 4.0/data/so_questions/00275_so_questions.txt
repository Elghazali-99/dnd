<p>I'm a web developer, and I want to make the web sites I develop more accessible to those using screen readers.  What limitations do screen readers have that I should be most aware of, and what can I do to avoid hitting these limitations.</p>

<p>This question was sparked by reading another question about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8472/best-non-image-based-captcha" rel="nofollow">non-image based captchas</a>.  In there, a commenter said that honey pot form fields (form fields hidden with CSS that only a bot would fill in), are a bad idea, because screen readers would still pick them up. </p>

<p>Are screen readers really so primitive that they would read text that isn't even displayed on the screen?  Ideally, couldn't you make a screen reader that waited until the page was finished loading, applied all css, and even ran Javascript onload functions before it figured out what was actually displayed, and then read that off to the user?  You could probably even identify parts of the page that are menus or table of contents, and give some sort of easy way for those parts to be read exclusively or skipped over. I would think that the programming community could come up with a better solution to this problem.  </p>
