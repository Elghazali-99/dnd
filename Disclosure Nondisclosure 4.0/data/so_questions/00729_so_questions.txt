<p>Does anyone know of a way to find out how much memory an instance of an object is taking?</p>

<p>For example, if I have an instance of the following object:</p>

<p>TestClass tc = new TestClass();</p>

<p>Is there a way to find out how much memory the instance "tc" is taking?</p>

<p>The reason for asking, is that although C# has built in memory management, I often run into issues with not clearing an instance of an object (e.g. a List that keeps track of something).</p>

<p>There are couple of reasonably good memory profilers (e.g. ANTS Profiler) but in a multi-threaded environment is pretty hard to figure out what belongs where, even with those tools. </p>
