<p>I'm trying to create a server control, which inherits from TextBox, that will automatically have a <a href="http://www.asp.net/AJAX/AjaxControlToolkit/Samples/Calendar/Calendar.aspx" rel="nofollow">CalendarExtender</a> attached to it. Is it possible to do this, or does my new control need to inherit from CompositeControl instead? I've tried the former, but I'm not clear during which part of the control lifecycle I should create the new instance of the CalendarExtender, and what controls collection I should add it to. I don't seem to be able to add it to the Page or Form's controls collection, and if I add it to the (TextBox) control's collection, I get none of the pop-up calendar functionality.</p>
