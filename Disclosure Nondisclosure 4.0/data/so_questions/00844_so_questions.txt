<p>I have a script for OS X 10.5 that focuses the Search box in the Help menu of any application.  I have it on a key combination and, much like Spotlight, I want it to toggle when I run the script.  So, I want to detect if the search box is already focused for typing, and if so, type Esc instead of clicking the Help menu.</p>

<p>Here is the script as it stands now:</p>

<pre><code>tell application "System Events"
    tell (first process whose frontmost is true)
    	set helpMenuItem to menu bar item "Help" of menu bar 1
    	click helpMenuItem
    end tell
end tell
</code></pre>

<p>And I'm thinking of something like this:</p>

<pre><code>tell application "System Events"
    tell (first process whose frontmost is true)
    	set helpMenuItem to menu bar item "Help" of menu bar 1
    	set searchBox to menu item 1 of menu of helpMenuItem
    	if (searchBox's focused) = true then
    		key code 53 -- type esc
    	else
    		click helpMenuItem
    	end if
    end tell
end tell
</code></pre>

<p>... but I get this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Canâ€™t get focused of {menu item 1 of menu "Help" of menu bar item "Help" of menu bar 1 of application process "Script Editor" of application "System Events"}.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is there a way I can get my script to detect whether the search box is already focused?</p>

<p>I solved my problem by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/69391/">working around it</a>.  I still don't know how to check if a menu item is selected though, so I will leave this topic open.</p>
