<p>I am ready to start using SVN, but I have NO (as in the money required for free beer) experience with source control.  I have installed subversion on my server (that was easy, 'apt-get install subversion') but now I don't know what to do, how to configure it, or how to use it.<br /><br />What suggestions do you have, and where can I find good resources to learn to start using it?<br /><br />
Update:<br />
O.K. So the feedback has been great and I have read through a bit of it but I want to clarify my question by saying that I am looking for more information on how to actually go about setting my up my repositories, clients, server, etc.  I know that I could do a quick Google search and find dozens (or more) resources but I'm hoping that someone whom has experience with subversion and a client(I have installed tortoise) could suggest a good reference that will be reliable, and have quality content.</p>
