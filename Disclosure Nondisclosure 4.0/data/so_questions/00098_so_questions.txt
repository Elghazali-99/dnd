<p>I was reading Joel's book where he was suggesting as interview question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write a program to reverse the "ON" bits in a given byte.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I only can think of a solution using C. </p>

<p>Asking here so you can show me how to do in a Non C way (if possible)</p>
