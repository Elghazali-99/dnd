<p>I am currently using the following command to upload my site content:</p>

<pre><code>scp -r web/* user@site.com:site.com/
</code></pre>

<p>This works great except that the .htaccess file is not sent. Presumably, this is because it's hidden.</p>

<p>I have tried adding a second line to send the file explicitely:</p>

<pre><code>scp -r web/.htaccess user@site.com:site.com/.htaccess
</code></pre>

<p>This works great except now I have to enter my password twice.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on how to make this deploy with only 1 or 0 entries of my password?</p>
