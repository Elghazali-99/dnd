<p>When calling <code>CoInitializeEx</code>, you can specify the following values for <code>dwCoInit</code>:</p>

<pre><code>typedef enum tagCOINIT {
    COINIT_MULTITHREADED     = 0x0,
    COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED = 0x2,
    COINIT_DISABLE_OLE1DDE   = 0x4,
    COINIT_SPEED_OVER_MEMORY = 0x8,
} COINIT;
</code></pre>

<p>What does the suggestively titled "speed over memory" value do? Is it ignored these days in COM?</p>
