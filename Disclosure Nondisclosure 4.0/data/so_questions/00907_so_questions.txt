<p>I have a QMainWindow in a Qt application. When I close it I want it to store its current restore size (the size of the window when it is not maximized). This works well when I close the window in restore mode (that is, not maximized). But if I close the window if it is maximized, then next time i start the application and restore the application (because it starts in maximized mode), then it does not remember the size it should restore to. Is there a way to do this?</p>
