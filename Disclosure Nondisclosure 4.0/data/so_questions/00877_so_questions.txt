<p>I have a BSTR object that I would like to convert to copy to a wchar__t object. The tricky thing is the length of the BSTR object could be anywhere from a few kilobytes to a few hundred kilobytes. Is there an efficient way of copying the data across? I know I could just declare a wchar_t array and alway allocate the maximum possible data it would ever need to hold. However, this would mean allocating hundreds of kilobytes of data for something that potentially might only require a few kilobytes. Any suggestions?</p>
