<p>If you use the standard tab control in .NET for your tab pages and you try to change the look and feel a little bit then you are able to change the back color of the tab pages but not for the tab control. The property is available, you could set it but it has no effect. If you change the back color of the pages and not of the tab control it looks... uhm quite ugly.</p>

<p>I know Microsoft doesn't want it to be set. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en/library/w4sc610z(VS.80).aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN</a>: '<i>This property supports the .NET Framework infrastructure and is not intended to be used directly from your code. This member is not meaningful for this control.</i>' A control property just for color which supports the .NET infrastructure? ...hard to believe.</p>

<p>I hoped over the years Microsoft would change it but they did not. I created my own TabControl class which overrides the paint method to fix this. But is this really the best solution?</p>

<p>What is the reason for not supporting BackColor for this control? What is your solution to fix this? Is there a better solution than overriding the paint method?</p>
