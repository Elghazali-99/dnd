The home is full of delightful antiques and knick-knacks - each one with its own history. We were visiting our son's fiancee who has been teaching in Mobile while she finished her master's degree in education. Breakfast both mornings was delicious with fresh fruit, scrambled eggs plus, coffee and juice both days, biscuits morning and banana pancakes the other.
