Hotel was off the strip, but close to a shortcut to downtown -made it easier to avoid some of the traffic. When I was checking in, lady had a meeting or something to get to, so I felt like I was inconveniencing her. Her replacement was ok, not really friendly, but not rude. Staff was better the next day.
