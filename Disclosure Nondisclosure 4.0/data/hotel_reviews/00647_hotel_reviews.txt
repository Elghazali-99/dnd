I thought the place was great. IMy only problem was that they didn't have the hot tub that Hotels.com had listed. Otherwise, the place was clean, modern and convenient. The beds were really comfortable. The food in the restaurant not so much. We got a coupon for $7 off per person for breakfast but we waited over 40 minutes for our breakfast and when it did arrive it was cold.
