Wanted to check out their wine tasting, the wine trolly was fun and affordable, the wine was great, the food downtown was good, nice atmosphere. Our Hotel was conveniently located very close to everything we wanted to do. Got some great deals at the outlets, which were close by, as well. Great weekend stay.
