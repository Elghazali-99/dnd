It feels unfair to complain about the amenities as the hotel was under renovations. However, I was extremely disappointed that the pool was closed for renovations. I was happy to see a brand new bed in our room, and the bathroom looked very nice. Until you pulled back the shower curtain. The same old bathtub. Very friendly staff, VERY convenient location. The kitchen lost our room service order, but did take six dollars off the bill. So I would recommend this hotel to others, but I would tell them to wait a while until they get the renos done and sort out a few issues.
