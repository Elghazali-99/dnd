The pictures on the web site were more expensive looking then the reality. We were told we had one of the best rooms, besides staring at cargo containers, the TV would not work so they changed our room. It was not well furnished and we could not regulate the air conditioner (way too warm for sleeping). The continental breakfast was good and the staff was very nice and helpful. The linens were harsh and uncomfortable. Sorry, but this was not at all what I expected and it was certainly unacceptable.
