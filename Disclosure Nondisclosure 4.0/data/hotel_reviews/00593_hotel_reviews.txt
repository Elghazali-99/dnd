Overall we were very satisfied with our stay. We were glad to see that many renovations are in the process of being completed, and hopefully will continue. The rooms are dated, but clean. We had dinner in the bar area and breakfast in the dining room. Both were excellent with generous portions! If the need arises, we would definitely stay at this property again.
