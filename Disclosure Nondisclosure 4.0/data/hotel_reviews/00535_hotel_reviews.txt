The hotel was fine, just know that smoking is allowed on some floors so there is lingering tobacco odor in some corridors. O'Brien's was a nice surprise, good food and great service. Also, a true breakfast is included with the price of the room, cooked to order not the typical complimentary breakfast buffet. The internet speed was good as well.
