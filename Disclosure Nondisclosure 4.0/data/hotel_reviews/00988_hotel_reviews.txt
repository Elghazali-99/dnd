Let's start with the positives. Great location to everything and the staff were super friendly. Now the negatives. Dated and a bit worn, not to my liking and certainly not to my wive and kids either. There were bugs in the room. The kind that fly and some in the bed. We were very displeased and embarrassed. I will not return.
