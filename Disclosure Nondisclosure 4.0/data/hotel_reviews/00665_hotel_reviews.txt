The hotel was fine overall, but when I grabbed the last bath towel I found it to be of rag quality. It was literally frayed on the end and you could see thin patches when the towel was held up. For $100 per night, I would expect better quality. The hotel room was neat and clean and staff was friendly. I would stay again, but check the towels before I needed to use one! Nice pool and hot tub area.
