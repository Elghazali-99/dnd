Stay was fine. Sneezed/coughed a bit my first night there, but seems to lessen the second night. Hotel looked great, but rooms are clean, but bathroom a little worn. Toilet is really low, but bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. Free breakfast, can be slightly more balance nutritionally, but it was okay.
