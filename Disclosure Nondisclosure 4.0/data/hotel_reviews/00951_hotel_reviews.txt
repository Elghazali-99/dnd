Clean and comfortable, nice hotel for its price range, good location--we enjoyed our 2-night stay. FYI, the outdoor pool is open until 11 p.m. poolside rooms are fine if you are vacationing with teens or night owls, but if you have toddlers/young children or anyone who prefers to go to bed early in your party, you may want to request a room on another side of the hotel--pool party noise kept us up late the first night (and we WERE the pool party noise the second night when we weren't worn out from traveling!) Several choices for breakfast (make-your-own waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, sausage, doughnuts, cereal, toast, yogurt, apples, fruit juice, milk, etc.) and you can get small discounts on tickets to several attractions if you purchase vouchers at front desk. The only very minor service/room condition complaints we had were that one of the electrical outlets was pulling out of the wall, that we had to call to request replacement shampoo/conditioner the second night, and also when we requested pool towels shortly before pool closing, we were asked to go to the front desk to get them, as they could not bring them down to the pool towel cabinet for us at that time (no big deal unless you're already wet from the pool, of course!) Overall, our three-room party of extended family had a good experience, and would stay again.
