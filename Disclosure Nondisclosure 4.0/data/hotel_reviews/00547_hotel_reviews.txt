All the hallways smell of smoke. The room was dirty when we checked in. The next day they never sent housekeeping to clean. Did not give us clean towels in spite of the request for those and housekeeping services. They said the housekeepers had all gone home. The restaurant was terrible service. One person waiting on the room over breakfast the first day. Twenty minutes to receive a menu and then nothing after the meal was delivered. We got our own flatware and coffee. The second day there was more staff but the waitress decided to change my plain yogurt to blueberry. I am allergic. Had to send it back. I asked for a manager to contact me but no one called. Called corporate and they wanted to give me points. Called Mr. Kong, the president of Best Western and they will give me a 50.00 credit, the first offer was a gift certificate for 50.00 No thanks, I wont ever stay in another Best Western again. The hotel manager has still not contacted me, its been three weeks.
