the hotel was great , clean etc. but that one desk lady was like not to helpful - and the business center is a desk next to the hotel desk and the computer didn't have Microsoft installed and that one desk lady is totally computer unaware and could not do anything to help with the business center malfunctions - except to say. yes, those computers didn't work right and that she knew you couldn't open any attachments and that staples was across the street.
