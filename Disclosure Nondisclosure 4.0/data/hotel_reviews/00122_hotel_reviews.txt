All the rooms have been recently renovated. They are in the process of renovating the lobby area. The room was new and clean. The beds were very comfortable. The bed linen looks new too. Its also nice to have electrical sockets at desk level and plenty of them. The breakfast was so so... eggs, sausages and hashbrown (no fruits) but barely edible.
