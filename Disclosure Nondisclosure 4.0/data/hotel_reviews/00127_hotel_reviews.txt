The Hawthorne Suites offers an affordable, comfortable environment that is convenient to the 580 freeway (just south of it) and within a mile and a half of downtown Livermore. Room was incredibly clean and comfortable. While they are currently going through a renovation, which I think will be really nice once it is completed, we rarely had any indication of the ongoing construction activities. Staff was very friendly and accommodating.
