The hotel was great, but the Buffet Breakfast was the worst I have ever had! The bacon taste like cardboard, eggs and sausage were cold, Pastries were hard and very little fruit. The only thing hot and worth eating was fixing yourself a waffle at the waffle machine if you didn't mind waiting in line for it.
