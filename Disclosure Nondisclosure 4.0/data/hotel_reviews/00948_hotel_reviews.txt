We stayed recently just to take our kids to Silver Dollar City. This is a motel and it is very noisy until at least 11:00 PM. The rooms are fine enough. Breakfast is a scrum of 15-25 people trying to get at the food while you are dodging small children. There are a lot of kids so don't stay if you aren't into the kid scene.
