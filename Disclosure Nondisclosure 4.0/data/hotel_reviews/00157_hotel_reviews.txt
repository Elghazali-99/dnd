I live somewhat local in Redwood City, but it's far enough away that after spending the evening with High School Friends, having a 30th gathering wasn't an official reunion, at a local beer pub, we didn't want to chance driving home after having a few beers. We made the reservation Friday night, and honestly, was apprehensive because of some of the reviews. Pleasantly surprised! The place was clean, it's had a facelift and looks good. The bathroom tub could use an update...but I have stayed in the W in downtown Chicago and the tub was worse and room was horrible. I'd take this room over that one any day! The breakfast the next morning was good. Nothing to write home about, but it offers a great selection and the eggs weren't watered down. Sausage was good...bacon...well, that looked and smelled like a dog treat. Passed on that one. But the coffee was decent and overall, was very pleased with our last minute choice to stay there...would do it again and would recommend others! It was 1/2 mile from the pub and right at the freeway, so leaving was easy, too.
