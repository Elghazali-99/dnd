The hotel is absolutely beautiful. We were very impressed by the dcor everything was clean and felt very upscale. The hotel is located near the freeway. There is a gas station, fast food, and shopping nearby. We were in town for a family event so we didn't do much exploring, but there seemed to be many amenities right in the area. The best part was the proximity to downtown Livermore. Wonderful shopping and dining opportunities, and only 5 minutes away. Also, the wineries are within a 10 minute drive. All in all, a wonderful place to stay and lots to do in the area.
