We made our reservations a month in advance, my wife called on the day we are suppose to check in, gets the run around of whether or not they will have a room or not! Who runs a business like this When they found a room we were given a couple cards, neither of which opened the door. Overall, you have no feeling of security, even if you are parked next to your room i was constantly checking outside on my vehicle.
