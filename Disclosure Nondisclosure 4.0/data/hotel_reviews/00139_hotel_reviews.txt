The hotel itself was very nice. Staff was very helpful, especially with accommodating us when we asked to check in early. The problem was with cleanliness. Our room was not clean enough - I found a floss stick on the table in our room. What looked like a condom was found when we went to use the spa. And the pool was full of leaves and dirt on the bottom. Otherwise, our room would have been great. Very large with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Nice large screen tv as well - made my husband happy.
