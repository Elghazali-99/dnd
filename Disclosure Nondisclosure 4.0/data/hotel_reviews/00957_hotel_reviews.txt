I was very disappointed. The reservation was messed up when I got there and they had charged my card instead of letting me pay cash as first agreed on. And then the desk person refused to cancel the extra room even though I had not requested it and I had to do my own calling to get problem corrected and I am still not sure it is fixed. Very unhappy with all of it. Room not comfortable. Spider was in my towel. And it did not help to have a room for someone with walking handicap because I had to walk up an incline on the driveway to get to my room. I will never use hotels.com again nor will I ever stay at this motel again. Ever!!!
