Beautiful hotel at a great value! Amazed at what we paid for a room on the concierge floor that included free daily continental breakfast, early evening cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, and after dinner dessert buffet. The Olivette restaurant was spectacular - had dinner there both nights. Will definitely be my go-to hotel any time I'm in Houston!
