I'ts a nice medium size hotel on the beach. With two stories buildings and a few pools spread out. The best part was definitely the staff They truly seem to enjoy their jobs and that makes all the difference. We stayed for four days and had a great, relaxing time. We went as a couple, but could come back with our children: There's a kid's club and some of the rooms have direct access -right of the back door- to a canal system that connect to one pool. If you walk down the beach, five minutes away, you will end crossing a nude beach/hotel. If you have a problem seeing naked people enjoying the sun, walk the other side (to the docks)
