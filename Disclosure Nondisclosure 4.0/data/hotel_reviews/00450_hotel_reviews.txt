We stayed a couple of nights for our daughter's bday and Father's day weekend for me as well. Everything was topnotch! From the courteous staff and great service down to every little detail. Our rooms were clean and well kept as well as all the public spaces. Our room had a nice view that seemed like we were in the woods. Indoor basketball and tennis court as well outdoor tennis courts just to name a few. Even has a lap pool (not sure if it was olympic size though). All gears and equipment are provided free of charge so no need to bring racquets, balls and even shoes. Just make sure to wear or bring socks but worry not as they sell socks if you happen to forget. We all enjoyed our stay. From my wife getting pampered inside their spa for most of the time to me and our teenage kids working a lot of sweat playing all sorts of sports. The only thing that was somewhat awkward for us was that their recreational pool was filled wth mostly small kids and toddlers with their Soccer Moms or the Rich Wives of Beverly hills type of women. Not really encouraging for a full grown man who likes to drink his cold beer by the pool or teenage kids/young adults doing their horsing around or whatever. Their lap pool is always occupied and Waiting a while for a lane to be vacant somewhat takes the fun out of it. Over all, It's a magnificent place to stay with so many things to enjoy while you're at it. And as my title says, It's a Country Club with a little touch of Hotel!
