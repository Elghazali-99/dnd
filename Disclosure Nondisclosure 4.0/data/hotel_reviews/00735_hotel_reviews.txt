We really enjoyed our stay at the Best Western Grand. It was an older hotel buy very comfortable, and the pool and the hot tub were clean. And even though there is a restaurant there, they also provided a continental breakfast. This worked out well for us, because we did not have time for a sit down breakfast the morning we checked out.
