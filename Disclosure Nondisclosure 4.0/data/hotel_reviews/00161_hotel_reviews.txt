Stayed here for a wedding weekend. Easily accessible from the freeway, 5min drive to downtown Livermore, good weekend stay for wine tasting or weddings, not much of a view in any direction. Rooms were clean with modern decor. Parking was free. Free continental breakfast. They were remodeling the dining area during our stay but it didn't bother us too much.... More
