Older hotel that could use some refreshing. Initial room smelled of cat urine. Comforter was old and tattered. Sitting chairs were stained. Staff was helpful. Moved to another room w/o incident. Overall satisfaction was fair. For a few dollars more could get something nicer. Breakfast was very good.
