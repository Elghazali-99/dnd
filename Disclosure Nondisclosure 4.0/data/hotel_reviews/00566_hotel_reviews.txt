We booked this hotel about a week ahead of time and were pleased. The hotel was recently updated. The bathrooms were beautiful. Our beds were comfy and clean. The pool and hot tub was a nice touch compared to the chilly weather outside. The only downfall was that someone put our bill under the door in the morning and it was substantially lower than what I had paid through expedia. When I inquired, I was told that it was a mistake and that I should not have gotten a bill. Breakfast was tasty but kind of pricy in the restaurant, the hotel did give us a credit but only for the registered adults. Not a free continental as advertised.
