When we got to the hotel our room was not available and they tried to give us a double twin bed room when we had payed for a king size. Then we had to wait a half hour for our room, even though when I called earlier in the day they said our room would be ready when we got there and we could come whenever since we had payed already. We also had ants in our room. Overall it was not a great stay,and I would like to request a free night stay or else I probably will not stay at your hotels anymore. I used to stay in them a good amount, and I am sorry to say that but that is how I feel.
