Not a lot of options where I needed to stay for work, but this hotel was nice. Fairly updated and the staff was friendly. Walking distance to Cracker Barrel and Applebee's, which was nice. Other restaurants within driving distance. Easy to get to, right off interstate. If I was back in town for work, I'd stay here again for sure.
