We always have a pleasant stay at the Houstonian, love the atmosphere, the rooms are also dark in the morning due to the lush greenery so we are able to get a good nights rest. We were celebrating our triplet grandchildren's 6th Birthday (their favorite hotel) and they were surprised by the hotel with a plate of fresh cookies and milk! Thank you Houstonian!
