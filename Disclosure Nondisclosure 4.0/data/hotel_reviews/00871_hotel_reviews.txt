We selected the hotel because of the price and it was to include breakfast. The breakfast was to be available beginning at 6:00 am. We went at 6:00, 6:20 and then again at 6:40. The room was dark and there was no food. We asked the desk clerk and he said that the staff didn't come to prepare the food. We left. I can't recommend Howard Johnson to my friends, family or co-workers and I do not plan on using Howard Johnson again.
