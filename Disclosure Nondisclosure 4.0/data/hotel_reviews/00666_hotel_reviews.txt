We have stayed here on two different occasions and could not be happier. Very clean !!! Staff pleasant and helpful. Includes a real breakfast at a real restaurant on site. We love that! And husband with back issues really likes the salt water pool and hot tub. I go for the treadmill. Overall we look forward to staying at Best...Dear E5985FNmarye - Thank you for the taking the time to write this awesome review!
