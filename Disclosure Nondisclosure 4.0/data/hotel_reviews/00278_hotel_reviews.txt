Terrible stay. Everything in the room felt damp as it was terribly humid. The place was dated and breakfast omelets were made in a different ZIP code or worse. The orange juice burned our throats fro the acidity. They had a cardboard like of the man in the advertisents. Now everytime I see his likeness I will run away.
