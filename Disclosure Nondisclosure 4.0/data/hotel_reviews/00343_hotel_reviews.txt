Very nice hotel with very nice atmosphere. Definitely something I'd recommend. The interior was renovated probably 10 years ago, so it's not brand new, but it's clean and comfortable. The Hotel CEO and the manager on duty took their time to talk to all guests one evening and ask about our stay etc. over a glass of champagne (free of charge). I've never seen such good service at a hotel. I should mention the spa and pool - very good bonus. If I had to say something negative - the internet connection. It's simply criminal to have such a slow and unstable internet connection in 2015. And may be, king size beds that are not to single beds with tendency to move apart.
