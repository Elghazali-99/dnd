This hotel is showing its age. Although my room was clean, everything seemed a little run-down. The carpets seemed old and the door frame had light from the hallway shining through it. The security latch was loose and missing at least one screw. I booked the room in a hurry for a last minute trip. When I got to Watervilled I remembered there are some much nicer places to stay such as the Hampton Inn and the Fireside Inn. For some reason I didn't see these on the hotels.com website.
