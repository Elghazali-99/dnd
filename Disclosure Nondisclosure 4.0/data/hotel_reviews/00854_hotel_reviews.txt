There were only a hand full of cars in the parking lot. But room was adequate although there was a fairly loud drone sound coming from the roof that I could hear not only in my room but also as I walked down the hall. I speculated that it was an HVAC unit on the roof. It was annoying but do -able so I didn't complain.
