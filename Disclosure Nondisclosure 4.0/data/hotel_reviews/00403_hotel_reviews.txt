The only place i'll stay in Houston. Fantastic service, incredibly friendly staff, great food and the best fitness options in the entire city. The rooms are a bit small and bathrooms are not luxurious by today's standards, but they are more than adequate and everything else about the place more than makes up for any shortcomings in that department.
