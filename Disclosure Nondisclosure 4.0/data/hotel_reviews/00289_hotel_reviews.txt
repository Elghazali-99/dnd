This is a GREAT place to use as a home base for exploring Mobile. Steve and Enoch know Mobile very well and can refer to all sorts of attractions, restaurants, etc. Mobile itself is just exquisite and is a fascinating place (at 300+ yearsw, it's one of the oldest cities in the US) and the downtown restaurants are TERRIFIC. Of the bed and breakfasts I've visited, Berney Fly is the closest to perfection. Steve and Enoch are wonderful and attentive hosts, the rooms are immaculate, the service is first-rate (and be sure to check out their pool in the back!). A definite must stay.
