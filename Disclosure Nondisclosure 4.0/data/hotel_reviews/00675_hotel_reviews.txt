There puddles located throughout the hotel that should have been vacuumed up but weren't. The pub furniture had seen better days. The restuarant had no heat one morning for breakfast. Nothing seemed to be working. This hotel needs a complete makeover. The workout facitlies are shared with the local peoples, who buy membership - so competition to use treadmills with folks other than those staying at the hotel. I had a sirlion steak for dinner and it was 3/4 fat, advertised with cajun spices - it had none - tasted as though it was thawed and boilded in water - disgusting. The vegitables were so mushy you couldn't pick them up with your fork. I would avoid this hotel until they do some major renovations!
