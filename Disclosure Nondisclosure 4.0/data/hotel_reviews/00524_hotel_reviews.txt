My girlfriend and I visited Waterville Maine for my birthday and to see some of my family. Was one of the most relaxing vacations I've been on. This hotel is great with a relaxing hot tub and spacious rooms. Don't forget the great Ice cream next door at friendlys. I would recommend this hotel to any of my friends looking for a cheap getaway.
