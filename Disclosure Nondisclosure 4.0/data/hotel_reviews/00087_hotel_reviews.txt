Only .3 (three tenths!) of a mile away from the Kirby St. gate of NRG Stadium. It can even be considered walking distance, and you avoid the price of parking! How nice it is to be so nearby after attending an exciting event at NRG Stadium.....saving the possibly long drive home, or to the airport, for the next day.
