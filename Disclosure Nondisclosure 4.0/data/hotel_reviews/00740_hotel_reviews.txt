first time staying here. room was great, very clean and spacious. bed was very comfortable which is not the case at most places we've stayed before. pool and hot tub were clean, indoor, and convenient to use. staff was friendly and the included breakfast in the resturant was awesome, not just the usual donuts, fruit, and coffee. overall very satisfied
