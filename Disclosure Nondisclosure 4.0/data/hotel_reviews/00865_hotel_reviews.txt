I won't stay at a Howard Johnson again. Had to be moved to a different room cause the key card wouldn't work. Asked for a non smoking room and room used to be a smoking room. It smelled like an ash tray, bedding had burn holes in it. Staff was very nice and helpful but was a very nasty feeling in either room. The second room didn't smell like an ash tray but did have a weird funk to it. There were random hairs find in the room. The ac was having a hard time keeping up on a 75day. Key cards had to be redone multiple times. Shower curtain was thin so water got all over the floor. Pillows were the size of my hand. All in all not a relaxing stay.
