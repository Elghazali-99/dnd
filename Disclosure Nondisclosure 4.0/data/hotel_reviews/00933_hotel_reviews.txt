The positives: Awesome lobby and checkin., resturants above average and 5 to choose from/ room service all hours/ beach is lovely and close/ very clean resort /close to cancun airport./ reasonable workout area Negatives: - staff always seems to be angling for a tip/ the cabana boy mafia controls all the ebacj spots and you have to play their tip game to get a spot/ clothing optional swingers beach is next resort down the beach/ no shuttles to airport or cars to rent to drive to nearby puerto morelos/ way too many kids and children over spring break. Not 1 16-18 year old boy for my daughter to socialize with./ expesive wi fi is not part of all inclusive
