Only problem we had was that we were not informed of the teen basketball tournament going on in the city. As a result, lots of kids, the room next to ours had the TV blaring until midnight and then on again a 5 am. We went to the lobby for our full breakfast at 10:15 and there was nothing left. We pickup a beagle and coffee and went to our room. They should have planned ahead for all the teens to eat all the food. There was 45 minutes left for breakfast time but nothing to eat. Outside of that, our stay was very nice. The gentleman at the front desk was especially cordial and accommodating.
