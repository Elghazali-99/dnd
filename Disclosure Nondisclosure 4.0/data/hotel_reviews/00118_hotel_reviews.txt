This hotel was promoted as being in the wine country. However, it was a block from the freeway. When we asked the desk clerk about this, she pointed her finger toward the door and said, It's about 4 miles that way. We had a great view of Jack in the Box parking lot. When we first entered our room and kicked off our shoes, we found ourselves stepping on numerous sand burrs left on the carpet. After working out and returning to our room at 9am, there was no hot water for the shower. The breakfast was adequate and the housekeeping staff were friendly.
