Clean, reasonably comfortable, well maintained. Very nice breakfast, extremely reasonable price. If you can get a room facing the courtyard, it is very pleasant and quiet. Like many hotels these days, it seems to be run by kids, who are friendly but not terribly knowledgeable or resourceful. Overall a nice stay, what we expect from Best Western.
