For starters, hotel staff was great. Very pleasant. However, upon entering the room, I discovered that it needed to be vacuumed and the bathroom was a bit dated. When I woke the next morning, I could see sunshine coming through the edges of the door. While I wasn't concerned for my safety, I did wonder how many bugs were coming to visit me during the night!!
