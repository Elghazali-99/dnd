It was a good stay. Didn't stay in room much for all the shopping and Silver Dollar City. Was so glad they have football channels so we could was our team win. This is the first hotel that the refrigerator kept our drinks and food cold. Sink water was hard to turn on and then it would spray water on you. Would stay there again.
