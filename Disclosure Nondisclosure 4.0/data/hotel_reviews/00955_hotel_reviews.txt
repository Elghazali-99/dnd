This hotel was rented for a couple on vacation from Illinois. We are a young couple so money is tight. This hotel was decent and the price could not be beat. The room was a little dirty (like the floor, for example) but I expected it. I do have a few things to caution you of: -The continental breakfast is less than stellar, but it gets the job done -Rooms by the pool are loud
