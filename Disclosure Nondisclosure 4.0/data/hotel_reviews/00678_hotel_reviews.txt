Crazy lady at the desk would not give me a receipt - she said I had to get if from hotel. Com. And the guest computer / business's center had such a strong fire wall I could not open my flash drive to open my documents and micro soft office. The man in the hot tub followed me into the locker room and made an offer to give me free whatever - that's not the hotels fault just kinda crazy . Not a bad place.
