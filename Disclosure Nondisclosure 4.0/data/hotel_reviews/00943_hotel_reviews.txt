Attention do not stay here for any reason! If there's no hotels available you'd be better off staying in your vehicle showering a truck stop! They treat their customers like crap, walk in your room w/out permission(waiting for you say anything), try to rush you out the rooms w/the doors open customers aren't dressed. If you leave your stuff in the rm they make you pay 25 to get it out won't give you a shuttle ride anywhere until you do. The showers are cold. I told the van driver just a minute after she knocked she swung the door open claiming she didn't hear me. I told her I needed to get dressed she snatched the door open againx2 the curtains while I was getting ready. Don't under any circumstance stay here pleaseyou'll regret it! That star needs to be a negative 5!
