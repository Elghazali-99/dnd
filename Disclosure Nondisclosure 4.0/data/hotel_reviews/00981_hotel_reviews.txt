We thought the hotel was a little tired looking. Drawer handles on the dresser were loose, things like that. The breakfast was the same every day would have liked a little more variety. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The maid service was not very thorough at times, i.e. pulling the sheet up and tucking it in without making sure the mattress pad was in place.
