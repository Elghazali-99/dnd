The staff was fantastic.  Nice room.  Could have used more than 2 bath towels.  It was a little noisy in the morning... I think it had to do with the washing machine... sounded like a loud helicopter.  I was a little disappointed when I went to swim in the morning that there was a senior exercise class going on using the entire pool and only a single lap aisle so no room for me to take a swim.It was a good stay and I would stay there again.
