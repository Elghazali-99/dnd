Our room was adequate except for the burn marks in the sink, poor tile work in the bathroom, and a malfunctioning heating/cooling unit. The unit made odd snapping noises periodically, had to be set on the lowest setting to not overheat the room (58 degree setting made it about 70). The unit leaked water onto the carpet and showed signs of having been "patched" with aluminum foil.
