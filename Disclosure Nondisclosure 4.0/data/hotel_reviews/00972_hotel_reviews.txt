This hotel was great. Nice area, clean, and close to strip and outlet stores. Only negative was the the shower head needed to be a foot higher. Im 6ft and I had a hard time washing my hair. Any taller than 5'7, you will have some trouble showering here. Other than that, I would of given this hotel a 5 but I would stay here again.
