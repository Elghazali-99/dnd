My doctor does n't know what the rash could be from and said he did n't think it was from the Vicoden because I had already been taking 1Vicoden pill a day for 2 months with no rashes up until the day I increased it to 3 pills a day which he says should n't make a difference bc if I was allergic , that should 've happened even when I was just on 1Vicoden a day
