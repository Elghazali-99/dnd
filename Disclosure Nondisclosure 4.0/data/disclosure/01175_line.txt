Now , my mother and I have not always been very close , as I said I never really bonded with her growing up and she kinda made it clear to me that she never bonded with meShe really was'nt ever a very loving mother , growing upBut , after losing my job , she has gone to be just terrible with meShe knows I was struggling financially before losing my job , and since all this happened she has told me that she regrets EVER adopting me because I 've been such a screw up to her over the years , a disgrace in her eyes , tells me that how me having MS messes up her lifeOh really , what about my life
