I grew up with an alcoholic dad myself so know more than enough about how neglect from parents can affect kids in later life and i 'm really worried my unborn child will resent me , not so much my 3 year old as he remembers why we left and tells me alot how he 's happy daddy does nt live in ' this house ' with us
