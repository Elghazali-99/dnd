Believe it or not I am pleased to read of other similar situations simply so I now know I am not alone – because I live with the part of tumour that was inoperable I try to keep exercise as controlled exertion to avoid possible fatal outcomes warned by neurologist although I do walk every day 610k upwards plus drink 23litres water – gluten free – vegetables raw or steamed mostly – no dairy and no caffeine off and on – it does make a difference to weight gain so started on dandelion tea , apple cider vinegar , ginger and ginseng recently for brain fog which has helped – I practice the intermittent fasting and lean toward Paleo – would like to consult with a good naturopath however have found my pockets empty and no results in the past so trying to do this myself now – any advice or comments gratefully received
