It 's kind of a complicated situation because , while his kids are much older and living far away I was never in a position to be a step parent , I 'm just their dad 's gf , but he came into my daughter 's life when she was just 5 , and she lives full time with me us and her bio dad is not in the picture so he DID have to take over the role of dad with her
