3 years later , i 'm 7 years old , i share a room with my sister , she 's asleep on the bottom bunk , and i call for my mom , because i had just made a promise to myself i 'm going to tell my mom everything you know cause secrets are dangerous , anyway , she told me to come down and tell her , i told her through tears , thinking she was going to hate me , she finally got me to tell her , tell me before daddy comes up he was in the sauna and i told her , i think she yelled for my dad , next thing i remember is them my parents talking , my mom was on the phone , probably with my aunt , who by then had had a daughter , who would have been 3 , and another , either on the way or just arrived , which are the younger siblings to , and i remember my mom saying something along the lines of no , how would she make this upimagine this she 's 7
