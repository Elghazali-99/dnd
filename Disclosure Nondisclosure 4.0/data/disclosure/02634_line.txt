3 days later sunday it gave me a pain in my lower abdomen and on my groin so that whole week i was worried so i googled all my symptoms which made me think of the worst , that week on saturday i went to the ER where they did a CT scan everything came out fine and the doctor told me it was just groin pull i just had to rest it out
