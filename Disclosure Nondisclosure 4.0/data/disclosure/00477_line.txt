it was april 2014 was feeling good and just minded my own things i used to smoke some weed every now and then not really much like 12x every week at best sometimes nothing for 23weeks then my holidays came and i had 2 weeks off so i wanted to celibrate with my friends got myself some 25i nbome its a drug with similar effects to lsd the first time i took it after like 34 months did nt really feel good i was kinda off in my head turned on rihanna usually i never listen to her but oh well seemed right for that time the trip was not horrible but not really what i wanted it to beso the next day i desided to try it again and this time it was perfect loved everything about it ate some chillis they tasted like rainbows
