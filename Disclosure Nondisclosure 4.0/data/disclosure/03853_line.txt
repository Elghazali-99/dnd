I believe there s different types of thingsillnesses that are being lumped intocalled schizophrenia when i think in fact they have different causesetiology or whatever eg hearing voices might be due to temporal lobe epilepsy , a brain tumor , true schizophrenia etc but most psychiatristsnarrow minded ones would just diagnose anyone that heard voices as having schizophrenia Thanks for your help
