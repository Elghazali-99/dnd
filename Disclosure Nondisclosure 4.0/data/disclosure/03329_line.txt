many times that something unexpectedly goodweirdnot normal happens to my life I question whether it really happened and I need to somehow confirm itand another one on our first date with my boyfriend , while we were kissing I was seeingimagining patterns and colours like i was dreaminglike when you close your eyes after smoking pot the only logical explanation I can give is that his kisses relaxed me so much that I was in a state between sleep and being awake
