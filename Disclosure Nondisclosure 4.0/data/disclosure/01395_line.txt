But my depression has developed into something that seems for like bipolar disorder than anything else cuz i have random highs and then i get really depressed and i do nt do drugs , nor am i on any perscribed medication BUT onto the schitzo stuff XD I heard that being bipolar you can also have halutionations , so maybe i m not schizophrenic but i ca nt help but wonder , i m paraniod of alot of things including mirrors , bathrooms and 300 AM , 300 because i more often than not wake up around that time every night and hear things and see things
