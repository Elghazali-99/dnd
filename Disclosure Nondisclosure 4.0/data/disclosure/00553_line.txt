She still did n't seem to concerned , she asked me did I stress a lot and ever had anxiety I told her yes but I do n't believe this is all caused by anxiety so she ordered a ultra sound for me before my ultrasound appointment my face started to go numb on left side my ears started to feel plugged and like they need to pop so I got the ultrasound and they said they saw to little lymph nodes on each sides and that s it 's normal my glandes on each side was different I think one side was like 2 cm and other was 4 cm but they said your body is different on each side
