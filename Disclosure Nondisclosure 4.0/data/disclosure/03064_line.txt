then her death came , he mourned , and so did i , and he wallowed , not having any fatherson interaction with me whatsoever , except for paying my school 's tuition and financial stuff , u could say he was more like a financial supporter than a father , anyways , my mother just did n't want to settle for such a low life as far as i can conclude , therefor several arguments took place , with him cursing my mother and her parents crucially , and i would stand by her defending her , not because i favored her but because it just was n't right , her parents had done nothing to him , he had no right cursing them , i also went in his room and told him if you behave properly and be reasonable , i will have your back as well , but if you do n't , i will stand up to you
