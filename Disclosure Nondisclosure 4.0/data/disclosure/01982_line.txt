I just got a job it 's only on the weekends but I worry that without sufficient treatment of my condition I will be unable to work , be a good family man , ect What I 'm wondering is if my longterm and pretty heavy use of marijuana is having its own effect on my depression and if it is , how I 'm supposed to quit well in the midst of all these medications each causing their own side effects plus the fact that I ca n't really miss work
