However recently the following has happened to me I keep getting a strange chemical ‘ whiff’ on my left hand at work , it smells like a paraffin type waxy smell I work in the Jobcentre this has happened maybe 6 or 7 times over the past 6 months – I think when this happens I am normally quite stressed at the time Lack of sleep – although I normally am 247 I think the stress is first before this
