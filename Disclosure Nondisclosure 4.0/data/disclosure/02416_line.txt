I am wondering if this could be a cancerous tumour as it has been there 4 years which makes me think it could be a benign tumour but i just recently read somewhere that you can have a slow growing cancer for up to 30 years which makes me worry it is a cancerous lump as it is hard , immovable and not tender to touch
