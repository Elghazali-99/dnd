When i was 13 we got a new dog and at this time i went through stages of humping objects like my bed or pillows i believe i was going through puberty until for some reason i placed my self on top of my dog to then lay on top like dryhumping i did this on and off for over 2 years as if i was enjoying it and i felt i could get away with it because it was amazing i had no idea what i was setting my life for doing these actsit all stopped after having traumatic break down and i promised myself this must stop
