I stopped eating last year , I have no reason I just feel grossed out by food I 'm lactose so there is n't much for me to eat n enjoy anyways , unless it was the right time or I starved myself for to long , 8 months ago my mother introduced me to feeling comfortable smoking weed , Which allowed me to eat but never helped get my appetite back and put my negative thoughts away for a few minutes
