Sometimes I still get them , I get so ANGRY I could literally make a hole in the wall and go kill everyone in the appartement next door and laugh like Hell while doing it but then , not to mention the fact it 's a crime and it disgusts me even though sometimes I feel like I have no choice , all that hatred turns to fear in a second and leaves me shaking like a freaking leaf without strenght in my bones
