Our relationship works on a cycle He is moody and combative for weeks and weeks while I walk on eggshells in hopes of not setting him off , then he blows up at me no physical violence though and then I crack and blow up at him and then he realizes how far he 's pushed me , he feels guilty and worships me just long enough usually 3ish days for me to think he 's really changed and then he slowly goes back to square one
