I have been trying very hard to avoid confrontations , so I say nothing , or leave the room , but inside I am just ready to burst , and if you have an anger problem , you know how it is , you let things build up until you explode , then you are exhausted and usually regretting things you saidbut they are getting close to pushing the wrong button
