I personally believe she has BPD BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER as well as social anxieties , she does n't let anyone other than her boyfriend of a year , myself and sometimes her dad get close to her if she goes anywhere else including school she has severe panic attacks and she is a recovering ' cutter ' so that makes her self concious as well she fights the urges and I believe has cut recently it 's an addiction too not just part of her illness let me just say that her reason for being traumatized was never dealt w properly by the Authorities no consequences anyone else had to deal with or answer to as her mother , this is horrible because I know the depth of her pain
