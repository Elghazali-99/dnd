Also today while just rubbing my head I noticed this really tiny pea sized , very hard , solid bump on top of my head , on the right side , above the forehead and right at the place where the hairline ends , it feels like its part of or fixed on my skull , there is no pain when I press on it but skin moves on top of it freely and it remains fixed in place , I have no idea how long its been there
