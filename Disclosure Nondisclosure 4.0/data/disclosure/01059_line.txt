His best friend and I have become very close , he 's like my older brother , and my partner seems fine with this however he does constantly want to know my relationship with every guy I talk to I have a lot of male friends Since having our little one , he never wants to go out together in the evenings as he does n't want to leave our little one with a babysitter the only babysitters I 'd trust would be close friends or family , and when we do make plans they are often cancelled because he does n't want to anymore so I find myself never going out unless he is at work
