I am just starting to see the heavier effects of puberty growth spurt , voice change , etc and just started to get extremly depressed to where i do nt want to talk to friends , go to school , play my favorite sport , lost motivation , constantly wanting to sleep , always thinking about past mistakes , worrying about every little thing , and getting sad at random times
