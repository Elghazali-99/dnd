I m constantly scared and so scared its unatural and i do nt know what i m scared of , i worry so much that i think one day it is going to kill me , if i had a conflict or argument with some one i would worry about it for weeks months and it will make me really down and upset , i would also hide in my room until everything clears up and feeel shaky and depressed , i find it hard to get out of bed atall unless there is money involved i m sort of happy when i get money but seem to spend it on rubbish and other people , them when the moneys gone i feel down , if i m in a rtoom with lots of people or out in town say , i get really shaky and feel asthough i m going to wee myself so i put my hands down my pants to check that i have nt that s one reason i do nt go out , when i m walking down the road i feel as though people in cars going past are laughing at me because i have weed myself but never have done before , so then i get paronoidi feel like people walking past me are laughing at me , also if i see two people whispering or talking slyly to eacvhother i feel as though they are saying nasty things about me or planning something , i feel asthough i m really hard and put across a hard face but the truth is i m scared of everything these days , i m fed up of somewhat pretending i m something i m not but its just me now , i do nt really show mental health problems its all in my head and personal that s why alot of people do nt take it serious but my life is slowly falling apart and the honest truth is i think about heaven alot and hope that its real incase i ever go but i also get scared about suicide incase my mum kileed herself if i did it or it ruined everyones lifes that s all that stops me , the only time i feel better if when it is storming and raining heavy no matter what time it is i always put my coat on and go for a walk and get soaked i love the dark and rain maybe because no one can see me i do nt know
