Trident "Strawberry Twist" sugarless gum is very disappointing, both in taste and consistency. The strawberry flavor is very artificial tasting and, though I guess it is a good thing, not very long lasting. The gum also gets "stringy" fairly quickly.<br /><br />I chew a lot of gum, but will not be buying this flavor again.<br /><br />Not Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
