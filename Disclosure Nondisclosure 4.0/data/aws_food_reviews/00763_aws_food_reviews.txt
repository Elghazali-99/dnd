This is a bold blend that has a great taste. The flavor comes bursting through. I usually brew & drink Organic Sumatra Mandeling from BJ's. I use this blend exclusively, so to get a cup that rivals the complex flavor from my Tassimo brewer is fantastic. Come on Amazon add it to the subscription service.
