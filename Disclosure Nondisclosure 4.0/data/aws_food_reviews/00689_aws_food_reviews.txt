I can't say enough good things about Plocky's chips!!  I have purchased this flavor and the black bean flavor <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWKO7G">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Black Beans 'N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> and I love them!  They taste better than more well known brands and are very satisfying.  I have never eaten a tortilla chip that didn't make me feel guilty afterwards.  Not with Plocky's...I always eat less and feel satisfied.  I actually prefer these eaten by themselves..no dips...and I keep a bag in my desk at work.  I have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something.  I bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too.  I am a fan of Plocky's chips and will continue to purchase them on Amazon.
