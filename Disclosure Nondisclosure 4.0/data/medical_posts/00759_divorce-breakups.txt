Mu mother in law has been living with us for 24 years now, right from the begining since I got married, I was never asked if I was ok with her living with us. she has been exterrmely dominating, all thru the yesrs, has complete control over my husband, he does not do any thing that would upset hr, I have no privacy in my life, as she will join us for my family events,  holidays everywhere, myhusband would even take her to couple outings. she has been extreemely demading and wants my husband to spend time with her, take her on trips , buy expensive presents for all her family. this has gotten progressively worst, I have tired to talk with my husband but he feels there is nothing wrong, to the point that recently I had a biopsy procedure done but she wanted my husband to go see her daughter with her in a different state , my husband even without giving a second thought went with her leaving me alone. I have told him several times I dont want to live with her and but he feels this is unjustified. I want to know what is my legal right in this regard, can he keep her in the house when I am not ageeable. I an totally frustrated and begining to get depresed because of this situation. please help me.
