Greetings, 
 I have caught bacterial conjunctivitis three months ago, after rubbing my eyes for one week in a raw everyday for several hours (i had itchy feeling ), afterward a yellow thick discharge began to appear in the morning that made my eyes stick together. I went to a pharmacy, the guy  there gave me tobradex eye drops, i used it for 2 days only, my symptoms immediately disappeared in the second day, however i discontinued using the antibiotic course thinking that it was cleared forever.
 Now i am having every 2 or 3 weeks an episode of bacterial conjunctivitis, that lasts for 3 to 4 days than disappear, the reason for its reappearance is probably because i constantly rub my eyes. I have the following questions:
 1-I have read somewhere that i should have not discontinued tobradex even if the symptoms cleared, because the bacteria has not been fully killed, and therefore it is reappearing again whenever i rub my eyes, is it true?
 2-I am having sometimes some mild pain in my left, with some redness in both eyes, some burning, itching sensation, frequent involuntary tearing and some sensitivity to light, are these normal symptoms for bacterial conjunctivitis?
 3- Is this dangerous? can it affect my eyesight in a way or another? what's next now, should i consult an ophthalmologist who will prescribe a new antibiotic? and for how long B.C will keep reoccurring?
 P.S: I am a man (no make-up) and i do not wear lenses.
 Thank you indeed for the great help.
Joseph.
