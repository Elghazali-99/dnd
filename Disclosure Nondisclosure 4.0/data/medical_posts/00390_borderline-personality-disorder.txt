However this is serious, the objective was to describe someone is emotionally, mentally, or physically unstapled (there's a specific word for it) and it a serious condition in which someone has trouble adjusting to society. It likes this scenario one:
1.) A Asian girl has a terrible social communication and outlook on the world because her parents are acrid and ignorant because she is a girl (they wanted a son), and they have to struggle to make ends meet. Because of this, she might not like socializing with others, have a very biased perspective, and severely punish herself for not meeting her parents expectations.
SENARIO TWO (Sorry I really want you to understand what I'm talking about):
2.) A boy is furiously upset with himself because he has now become a paraplegic because of a car accident that occurred while being driven to school. Because of this accident, he can no longer play his favorite sport (which he was about to get a scholarship in) and now is going though a lot of suffering in order to adjust to this life.
 The reason they're are scenarios like this is because if someone had a different mentality, they would have coped with these situations differently. I'm mainly interested in with what not the obvious and why it's done: like you see a family in which everyone is fat and stupid yet they miraculously have a son or daughter who is sweet, slim, and serine.
 Do you recommend any good reads?
