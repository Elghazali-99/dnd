I am 32 years old, diagnosed with BPD 6 years ago. I applied for SSDI and got it first time around. No need to appeal or anything. I fit all the traits of BPD. But everything I read says that BPD stems from sexual/mental/physical abuse as a child. I had a wonderful childhood. My dad worked full time, my mom was a SAHM. We had a nice house, family vacations. Not a day went by that I didn't hear "I love you" from my parents. Definitely no abuse at all in any way. My BPD came to light right after my kids father left me. I'm a great mom, very attentive to my kids, love doing fun activities with them, and give them the world. My kids are my everything. But I'm still struggling. My temper flares bad. The littlest thing sets me off. Then on the other hand, I'm a child. I get so insecure, scared. I can manage my finances, pay all bills on time. I just had my 5 year redetermination and SS determined me still disabled. I have a functional support worker I see once a week every other week and a psychiatrist I see once every two months. My meds are Zoloft 50mg once a day and Trazodone 100mg once a day.
