I've been getting chest pains for some time, but have been checked out twice in A&E to be told I have an almost athletic heart.
The pains coincided with news of job redundancy, which was shortly followed by moving in to our first (bought) home, so whilst these things combined were stressful experiences, I brushed it off.
I managed to find a new role, which I begun in January, but have been finding things extremely difficult, much more than I should. I then attempted to tackle my fear of flying, which was followed a few days later by two flights.
The tightness in my chest has been becoming increasingly frequent, and my ability to do relatively straightforward tasks at work, progressively more difficult. I've begun to suspect the pains are anxiety related, and that I may even be suffering from PTS, brought on largely by the events pre Christmas, but further aggravated by my new role (which is relatively challenging) and other things like my flying experiences.
Do you agree?
