Today I had to ask my boyfriend to move out because I don't know how to deal with the changes in him that have been gradually intensifying since February when he started having paranoid trips during smoking pot, then from time to time he'd become paranoid sober.  I used to be able to calm him down, but now its almost like he thinks I'm incompetent for not being paranoid with him, at least when he's in that mode.  Anyway, he's gradually become emotionally and physically abusive, which is a totally different man than who I knew for the first 10 months.  Now, naturally, the first response is, "End it.  Abuse is not acceptable", and I already agree with that, hence why once he calmed down I asked him to pack his things.
 Behaviour changes include; misanthropy, anger, verbal abuse, and physical abuse, and, though not so much recently paranoia
 No, I just want to ask people about their triggers, or the triggers of others, and dealing with them.  What are things you, or people who know sets them off, and have said help ground them, for instance, he told me once smoking helps?  I came across someone on here who mentioned music.  I've also done some reading where it mentioned yelling is a trigger, which makes sense in relation to what happened this morning and how something so small escalated so quickly.
 He seems very lost lately, recognize these changes in himself, but goes back and forth as to why they are happening.   As far as I can tell there's no talking to him about therapy or meds, so I'm trying to keep this question simply focused on what I Can talk to him about as his friend rather than girlfriend.
   Thank you for your help
