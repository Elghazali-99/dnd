Well, as my previous post talked about the extreme emotional abuse I am having with my mother, things are just NOT getting better, and to be honest,---it's taking it's toll on me!!!-----I "attempted" to tell her how my dr appt went regarding the Strong progression of the MS, and she basically wanted to hear no part of it.---I tried to tell her how I have to have more tests based on how fast the MS is eating my body up, how I feel about it all, (my fear, sadness, whatever), and like I said,---SHE WANTED TO HEAR NO PART OF IT!!---And that is just tearing me up inside.---How and Why would a mother not want to know/what this is doing to me?---I just CAN NOT understand why she is so STUCK in her "feelings" that I am such a loser, burden, that I'll NEVER go anywhere's or BE anything.----Why she could give a **** that I am suffering in just about EVERY level of my life.-----I just feel like ever since I was Dx'd she hates me even more!--I can't convince her I NEVER asked to get sick,--and never planned on this just bringing me down so fast.----She has repeatedly told me or made me feel that I am a loser, I am a disgrace, I am just never gonna be anybody.---And it's REALLY bringing me down.---I just wish and pray I can get out of here/away from her, and try to PROVE I'm NOT a loser, burden, disgrace, or whatever else she sees me as.---But, I can tell ya this---now and with all that I feel, I can CLEARLY see why people concider "ending it"!!!!!---I have thought about it EVERYDAY!!!!----ANYTHING TO END THE PAIN!!--Not from the MS---end the pain from her!!!----Sometimes (actually alot) of times I just think "If I take a whole bunch of my Vicodin and Neurontin pills, then I can END the pain, sadness,being a loser/burden, feelings I am feeling.!!!! It's like everyday I want to just end it all.---Ok, I know I have not been an "Angel", that I've made mistakes in my life, I know I've let people down and whatever, but my question is ---why would someone WANT to go on, in this fashion???----I'll tell ya this---I am so sick/tired of being treated like SH#@, sick of being told over and over I'm a loser, I'm a disgrace to the family, tired of feeling like it WOULD be better for everyone IF I WAS'NT around anymore, tired of being alone every damn day by myself.  Nobody calls--nobody visits--nobody does ANYTHING.--It's like "IF" I did end it all with my pills---it would be DAYS before ANYONE WOULD KNOW ABOUT IT, CUZ NO ONE EVER CALLS OR COMES AROUND!!!----But, right now, I just feel it would be in EVERYONE'S best interest if I do just do what I have to to end my pain/sadness/lonliness.----It would be like my final "gift" to myself.----I'm sorry to dump all this out there to you guys--it's just I can not take anymore!!! The pain of what my mother says to me, the way she is making me feel, the whole shabang is more then I can carry EVRYDAY in my heart/mind.---I NEVER understood why she felt that way to me (her alledged daughter), why I'm seen as a loser and disgrace,how she could leave me alone, without alot of basic needs, why she just turned her back on me.---Think about it---would'nt that weigh on your hearts/minds???---I don't know---I just know I want to end the misery. It'll OBVIUOSLY please all of the family, please her-cuz then the "burden/disgrace" isn't there.  WHAT A MESS!!!
