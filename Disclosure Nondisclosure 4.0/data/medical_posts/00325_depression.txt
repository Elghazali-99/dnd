My doctor prescribed trazodone 100mg (I think it said mg) for my insomnia that I have suffered with for the last 15 years due to a thyroid problem I had years ago. 
 I took it for the first time last night, but I did not fall asleep or even come close to falling asleep. I took it at 8:30pm and went to bed at 9pm, but ended up getting out of bed at 10pm because I could not sleep. The only difference I feel is a huge headache this morning. Will this medication eventually work and I just have to give it time?
 I have been on Ambien for the last 2 years, but I can only take it once every seven days (20mg) or it will not work. I average about 2-3 hrs of sleep without sleep medication, I can literally go 36hrs straight with out any sleep, and then I crash and can actually sleep 4-5 hrs, but I am used to it and do not have a problem with work or any other activities. I do not fall asleep at my desk. I am unable to nap.I know my body is fatigued, but my mind will not shut down AT ALL, so NO SLEEP. 
 Just thought I would get opinions on this medication....
 Thanks.
