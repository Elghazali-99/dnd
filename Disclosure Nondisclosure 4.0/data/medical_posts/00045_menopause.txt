My life has taken a turn for the worse after breastfeeding. Hormonal fluctuations gave me terrible migraines and weakness and i was getting all sorts of symptoms from low estrogen.  I had it pre pregnancy all my life but it's exponentially worse now.     With the suggestion of my previous endo i tried birth control pills.
 1. Microgynon 20: fixed migraines but have me daily headaches,  joint pain,  dryness, and terrible mood swings and back pain (I'm still going to physio. Does low oestrogen cause back spams? ? Mine hasn't let go).
 2. Norimin 28: fatigue,  lethargy,  feelings of self loathing and anxiety. 
 My endo did sex hormone tests but I won't see her until June and i think I'm ready to try another birth control pill.  I hear sometimes it takes many tries to find the perfect one. I would love to hear from someone who takes it continuously (for hrt, migraine, endomeyriosis) as that's what i do,  but i had to stop the norimin 28 due to anxiety.  I wonder if i needed a break.  
 I'm sick of this perimenopause business which i feel I've been having all my life because I've got hashimoto's too and i just want my hormones leveled out.  I feel like I'm getting unhinged and it's doing my nut in. Is anyone else going through this?
