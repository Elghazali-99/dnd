im a straight male..
i went out to a party 2 weeks ago and was roofied.. thankfully we left the party and went to a bar before the roofie kicked in.. at the bar i remember nothing though.. all i remember is falling down and hurting myself, and then a stranger asking me to get out of his car..  
 i fear that i was anally raped.. im very paranoid and this fear hasn't left me in 2 weeks!!
 if i had in fact been raped, how would i feel the next day?? i had no anal pains the next day and my clothes looked clean and on right.. but 3 days after the party, my anus started feeling a burning sensation.. (maybe because of the alcohol/roofie/stress and diarrhea)... and 10 days after the party, i developed a perianal abscess.. i get these from time to time.. i have been having breath taking panic attacks daily over the thought of possibly being raped anally. i think the stress has even given me intestinal problem too.. my intestines are cramped and they hurt.. 
  please, can someone open up  and  tell me if you feel pain the next day after anal rape? or do you feel pain a couple days later??  what kind of pain is it?? mine started at the sphincter as a burning sensation.. now i feel as if im being poked by a pin in my anus.. like a crawling feeling just in the anal opening..
please help me out!
