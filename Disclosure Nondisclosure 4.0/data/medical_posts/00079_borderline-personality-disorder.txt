Hi, i just joined the site not too sure what its all about, but i have a sneaking suspicion that somethings not qquite  right with my mental state
 its been gradually getting worse since i was around 15, im having extreme trouble concentrating in collage- its like my mind will just go blank in the middle of a thought and it wont come back until like 5 whole seconds afterward-and bear in mind this happens everytime i try to think about something, be it hard or blindingly easy
 also i tend to get confused quite alot too, which is annoying because ill seem so slow when im actually reasonably intellegent its even got to the poin where if my mum asks me if im hungry, i wont be able to figure it out until my stomache rumbles!
 i dont really have any friends anymore because apparently "im not who i used to be anymore" i dont know what that means exactly but they said something like "wheres your emotion?" and "why dont you talk as much anymore"
oddly enough that suits me just fine, cosi dont enjoy half the stuff i used to like going bowling or going to the ginema just seems like a drag more than anything else and i prefer to be all alone and id love a solitary existance, where i didnt have to talk to anyone and i could just be left alone to do whatever i needed to without being interupted or feeling like im being watched/talked about.
 even my family is starting to tell me that im too withdrawn or too secretive and i should go out more and socialise and all this other bulls**t that perents say- wish theyd just dissappear and leave me be..
 so yeah thats pretty much it any advice whatsoever will do me fine.
thanks, and sorry if i rambled i tend to be a bit too wordy when writing long things..
