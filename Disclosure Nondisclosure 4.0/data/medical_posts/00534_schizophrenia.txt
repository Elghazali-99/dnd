Hi Everyone, I was raised in church Pentecostal. However Until I was 13 we attended then we stopped going. I am now 28yrs. Everytime I had a crisis, I prayed for Peace. A few months ago my brother died, and every since I have thoughts that there is not meaning to life, NOt suicidal, but spiritualy. We come here to Live Maybe Suffer, and when we Die, we have not consience and there is no other REalm. No Afterlife. Whats the Point? Death Is My Number one fear, (and As a little girl I always had Crazy dreams of the demons bad spirits after me, Or the End of the World Constantly in Dreams.)... So when I would eat, death was on my mind, that I may choke, showering that I may fall, driving that I may Crash, going outside that someone will Harm me.???? OMg. I cant handle this. Now this past Month, its just God, where are you? God are you true, when we Die we just die, we will never know the works of Earth , we will never know what happens to the World, to our Family, What is to come? God What is the point in living, Just as animals dont have souls neither we-must not have any either.  I am going from Spirituality, to Evolutionist.. I dont like the thoughts, are CONSTANT PARANOIDIC TYPE THOUGHTS. God this God that, Death this and Death that. Please help answer these questions for me? I have never been diagnosed with any mental illness, I am hispanic and was raised in church. I would discuss this with my mother and she would just say, Your strong, its just the devil getting to you, YOu dont need medication, that will just clog up your mind. Be strong and Pray.
 Someone Please Help..
