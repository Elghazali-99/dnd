i feel so lost and my thoughts are everywhere my mind wont stop racing. i've barely been able to eat i feel so sick, it feels like a lot of effort for me to get up to even make something to eat. I feel worthless hopeless. Like a big nothing. I'm getting terrible anxiety , my wrists get cold, my stomach starts hurting, my negative thoughts wont stop. I think about suicide 24/7 and i dont want to think about it, is that normal? I try to tell some people who im close to how i feel , but they just blow it off like no big deal , everyone just says " your fine " or " don't worry about it" "it will go away" "your tough", that really pisses me off and makes it worse and makes me angry that no one is listening to my cry for help. Im up all night crying every night.I can't function I can't concentrate. I feel like I can't feel anything but pain. It hurts so bad and I need someone , I feel like I don't have anybody , and I feel like you don't want me home. I don't know what to do anymore.What do I do ? Who do I turn to ? Do I have to fight this a lone , because if I do I can't make it. My mom brushes it off , so does my grandma and anyone else I try to give little signs too. I know that I need help. I barely even know what I'm doing , my thinking is all messed up , my attitude and anger isn't me , I don't feel like me , I worry all the time my anxiety is getting worse . Please help me (even if its just talking or reassurance)
