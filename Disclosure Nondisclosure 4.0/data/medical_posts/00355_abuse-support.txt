hi there.
last week on his thirteenth birthday my son was left alone with my friends four year old son for about an hr. 
my son is a young just turned 13 year old. still in primary(elementary) school
after we went home that night, my friends son told my friend that my son had touched him with his penis etc. 
my friend rang me crying and screaming this down the phone, as i was driving home, thru the countryside so my son heard this this way.
my son since then and at the time, denies that he did any of the things the boy has said.
anyway, we had an interview with child protection and they were alos told the same of what happened that evening , by my son.
 now.. my situation is - my son may be lying, doesnt appear to be and is behaving just like his nice natural self. if my son did this, it is almost certain that he has been abused himself as this behaviour is not something age appropriate.
 if he didnt well just being accused could be damaging to him.
 i need to get counselling myself ( i am in a paramedical profession), i want counselling for myson but i dont want him to think i dont belive him. 
 i am open to thoughts and suggestions.
 that is the short version
i am extremely devastated, have had to postpone my clients/and patients this past week, and havent really known where to turn. my friends have been very supportive.
i live alone with my son and part time with my daughter who has just turned 20 she is due home tomorrow.
my son has not lived with his dad since he was a baby and doesnt have contact with him, his dads choice.
my son has had a nice childhood regardless of this, he goes to a Waldorf school, plays games and some sport, not a dvd watcher, not a computer user...
anyway thankyou , in advance
