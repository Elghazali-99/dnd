Hi - I am trying to find out what's wrong with me and it is hard to explain.
 For a few years I've been depressed. I've given up with the world and I hate everyone and everything that I used to enjoy. It feels like I don't have any emotions in my body. I have been on anti-depressants but that didn't do anything to me. I'm always fighting with my girlfriend at the moment and I don't know what's happening. I'm too depressed to even bother to attempt suicide again. I don't trust her any more and I'm always suspicious of her motive as she has let me down before by breaking my promises that I NEVER break. I don't even think I can carry our relationship on as I'm so paranoid and jealous. I put myself so down and I usually hurt myself because of that. I always say I'd like to slit her throat because of what she's done. Makes me so angry and like why should I carry on caring? But I do love her with all my heart and never will I do anything to hurt me. 
 I feel like I change moods often and the motivation in my life has gone. I just wish I could end all the pain and misery going on in my life at the moment because it's just becoming too much.
