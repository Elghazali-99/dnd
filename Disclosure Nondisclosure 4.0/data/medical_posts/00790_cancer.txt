My brother was diagnosed with lung cancer during a routine check up as such he did not have any symptoms.
In September 2013 his Ca 19.9 was244.03 and serum CEA was 49.5.His Pet scan showed a mass ase of metastatic adenocarcinoma involving liver leison. For evaluation of unknown primary malignancy and for initial staging. 
 Findings :
Heterogeneously FDG avid large mass lesion is noted in the liver (12.6 x 12.9 cms, SUV max 28.73)
Few cm sized aortocaval nodes are seen (SUV max 4.42)
No evidence of abnormal FDG uptake or obvious soft tissue seen anywhere in the body to suggest the site of primary malignancy. 
Multiple non FDG avid hypodense lesions in both lobes of liver appear to be benign cysts. 
No lung nodules are noted on breath hold CT. 
Rest of the whole body scan is unremarkable and represents physiological tracer distribution. 
He was given four chemo cyles of GEMox
His PET scan in November 2013 was unchanged CA 19.9 increased to 435.37
He was given three cycles of Chemo CAPIRI.Today he has undergone the tests CA 19.9 has slightly reduced to 428.69 and Serum CEA has gone up to 69.79.
His PET scan says
 FDG avid large ill-defined necrotic mass lesion is noted in the liver (12.3 x 11.5 cms, SUV max 19.15). 
No significant abdominopelvic adenopathy. 
No lung nodules are noted on breath hold CT. 
Rest of the whole body scan is unremarkable and represents physiological tracer distribution. 
 Partial metabolic regression with no significant morphological change in liver metastases. 
No evidence of active disease elsewhere in the body. 
No new lesions seen. 
Is the tumor shrinking
