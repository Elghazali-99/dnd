I'm 23 years old. I didn't grow up in a safe household as a child. My biological dad has bipolar and my mom worked a lot to raise my sister and me. My dad was abusive to my mom and to me, he was unreliable. After my parents separated, my mom and sister forged a new path but I claimed I "loved my dad" and couldn't give up on him. I was 13 when my mom told me that he wasn't a safe person. A couple of years later, I had a flashback. I don't remember what it was all about except that my dad was hurting me somehow. This flashback was when I was young.
Then, after my dad left, I masturbated a lot and resorted to fantasizing. It still continues to this day, where desiring sex has led me to really bad situations. I have had flings but not realizing what they were. I had unprotected sex. And then I was raped.
I'm concerned that all of this was because my dad molested me. But I don't know how to express my concern to the people I love or trust. I tried to tell my mom once but she didn't believe me.
