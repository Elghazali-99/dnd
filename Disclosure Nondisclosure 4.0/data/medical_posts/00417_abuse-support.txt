my mom always used to get overly mad at me. she'd throw me against walls for accidently spilling salt on the counter. she'd tell mee how much she hated me and how she never wanted to see me again, then she'd drive me to my dads house at 2 in the morning. one day, we were in the car and everything was fine, she asked me to call my uncle and i did. i hung up and told my mom he didnt answer. she started going OFF on me cuz i didnt leave a voicemail, "Jesca what the hell ! do you do this to all your friends too?!" blah blah blah. then she slapped me across the face and cut my eye, i couldnt see out of it for the day. it always turns bright red, and i have major headaches all the time because of it. my dad got so mad and threatened to take full custody of me. she got pissed and left me. she moved to england with her fiancee who she didnt even tell me about, i found it out. then she came back for a week wanting to see me but i refused. she went to arizona for a month then came back again but yet again i refused to see her.she left once again to arizona. saying shee will never come back. my mom had always lied to me, she hid bad bad things from me and ive found out MANY things bout her for the past nine years. she scared me for life by some of the things shees done. things i dont even want to mention.
