I recently moved out to my own place 5 months ago. As a 22 year old, my BPD is likely peaking (at least I hope this is the peak. God help us all if it gets worse from here). I go through several week-long periods where an episode is lurking around the corner and constantly threatening. I have been in a new relationship, as well, which has tested my self-soothing skills completely and even helped in my improved skill set. I have never received therapy due to lack of insurance, but I follow DBT almost religiously and have been working hard on my own to develop these skills. However, working alone comes with the price of time. With a full time job, I don't have a lot of down time, so my evenings are usually spent laying in bed on my phone or crying when I'm not spending time with my significant other. I have piles of clothes, makeup, and other messes around my bedroom that have been ignored simply because of my lack of functionality during these trying episodes. I take a low dose painkiller when I am in a situation that absolutely requires my presence and attention. I consider myself a highly capable individual and most of my work/social success rides on my being 100% accountable mentally. The impulsive feelings and desires seem to get worse and worse each time, so my self talking skill set is always being put to the test. Does anyone have any tips or personal ideas they can share in regards to how they overcome the trials of frequent episodes? I know each person is different and experiences different symptoms, but any information or help would be greatly appreciated.
