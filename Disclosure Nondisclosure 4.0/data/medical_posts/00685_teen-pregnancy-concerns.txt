Today, me and my boyfriend were fooling around like we normally do when we're alone, we've been together for almost ten months and never had sex. We've done oral but thats the furthest we've gone. 
Whilst fooling around today, it got to a stage thats never happened before - i was on my front, him behind me, and his uncovered penis inbetween my "cheeks". He didnt go in, but neither of us wore any underwear, and he didnt wear a condom. Whilst he was just moving, he slipped down, but his penis never went in. I don't remember where the tip  was though, it could have been past or just covering my vagina. I am absolutely positive it didn't go in.
He didnt ejaculate, however he had done previously, but gone to pee afterwards. After we did that,  i went into the bathroom, peed as well, then wiped my area clean with both tissue and a wet cloth. 
My last period ended two days ago. 
Is there a chance i could get pregnant? Is it a high possibility? Is it worth going to the pharmacy tomorrow and asking for the morning after pill when I'm underage in the uk? Please help because both me and my boyfriend are becoming paranoid
