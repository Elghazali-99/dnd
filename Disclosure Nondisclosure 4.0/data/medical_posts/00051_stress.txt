So me and my boyfriend moved into an apartment together. I suppose the pastor of the church I *used* to go to found out. He started calling me, telling me the Bible disproves of it & we should either get married or not live with each other. Well I wasn't going to move out & me and my boyfriend aren't ready to get married. So I jus let him say what he needed to say and thought that was the end of it. He kept on calling me anyway, my mother said after 3 times he'd leave me alone because some Bible passage says something like that. ANYWAY, i started avoiding his calls and not calling him back. HE SHOWED UP AT MY APARTMENT. So I'm forced to have a 'sit-down meeting' with him becuase I don't want to be rude and tell him to leave.
I finally ended up telling him the next time he called that my boyfriend and I were going to figure it out on our own and we appreciate his concern but I'm not even a member of the church anymore but thanks. Well he ends up showing up at my apartment again, this time with my uncle. After that I have completely ignored all his calls, even picking up and immediately hanging up on him.
Just a few minutes ago (at 8:30pm) he showed up and asked if he could come in and have a 'quick chat' with me. I told him no because I was busy. He then said that he needed another day and time that I'd be available. Becuase I feel that it'd be rude for me to flat out say "Leave me alone." I set up a day and time we could talk.
This situation has stressed me out to the point of tears and I don't know what else to do to get him to leave me alone. I've told him that I don't need his help, I've ignored his calls and voice mails. I need someone to tell me how to handle that..
