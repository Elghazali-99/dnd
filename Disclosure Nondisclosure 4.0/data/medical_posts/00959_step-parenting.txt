On occasion, we will eat out as a family when my 8 year old step-daughter visits. She stays with my husband and me about 2-4 nights a month. I have a 9 year old son. My husband and his ex are trying to get their daughter to eat better (she is about 20 lbs overweight) but they are very inconsistent. For example, my husband won't allow her to order a soda but she can have a double order of fries or a second entree. Meanwhile, my son does not have any food or weight issues so when we go out, I let him order a soda as a treat. 
 My husband recently informed me that he was "talked to" by his ex because their daughter complained to her that when we go out, my son gets a soda and she does not. The inference is that I should not allow my son to have one in her presence. Is it ok for his ex to dictate what we do on our time (I think not!) My husband thinks we need to "compromise". I think she needs to mind her own business and not involve herself in what I choose to allow my child to consume. She allows her daughter to eat donuts for breakfast so why make a fuss over the occasional soda? Who's right???  Any advice on how to handle?  Help!
