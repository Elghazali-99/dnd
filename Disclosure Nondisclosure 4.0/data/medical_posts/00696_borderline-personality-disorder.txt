Well, I have been clean now for almost 5 weeks.  And by clean I mean not being destuctive to myself.  And by not being destructive to myself, I mean not looking at pornography and masterbating to it.  I mean, this is something I keep track of in my head, and when I realize how well Im doing, it makes me feel better.  Like I'll keep saying to myself "ok, its 4 weeks now, ok its 5 weeks now." stuff like that.  And the reason I want to do this is because without lusting so much it gives me a clearer head, and Im able to just live better.  Period.  But today I've been having some fears.  Like Im sometimes afraid of my commitment to my fiance, in which we're getting married in 2 months, and I dont want anything wrong to happen.  But I know how awesome she is.  I do love her.  I do.  I guess I just miss her.  I dont know.  But I think of other girls alot, it sometimes calms me.  But I cant help it.  I love women.  Its just weird.  I used to think I was Bisexual but I realized it was just from so much lusting that I thought this way.  Now I dont do it anymore, I feel more innocent I feel more free.  But that one fear always hits me.  That one about my fiance.  But at the same time I have so much belief that we should be together forever.  She's awesome, I love her with all my heart.  What do you think?
