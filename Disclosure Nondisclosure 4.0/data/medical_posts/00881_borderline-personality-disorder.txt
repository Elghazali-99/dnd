I am 33 years old. I have too many inner issues to even start to list that go back to childhood, but I am trying to figure out whether or not to seek some help. Some of the thoughts that go through my head almost on a daily basis are really starting to "rev" up, And although I haven't yet, I fear that my control on them is slipping. Some of the issues I have are paranoia, extreme anger to pure rage, depression, I become very with-drawn from people including my wife, among other things. My thoughts will range from suicidal to homicidal according to my mood. When I'm not down or angry I am happy, the life of the party, charming and whitty, but those days are few and far between anymore. I'm usually just quiet and kinda in the background most of the time. I know thats not healthy and I've tried to change it myself to no avail. I know that I should seek a professional but I'm afaid of what may come of it. I am an odd cookie to say the least and this isn't even stratching the surface but I have to start somewhere, right? Any advice will be welcomed with open arms...
