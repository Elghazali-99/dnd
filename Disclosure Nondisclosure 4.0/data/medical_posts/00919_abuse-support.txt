I am 18 getting ready to turn 19 in July. When I was 17 my father basically wanted me to have sex with him and not tell anyone. I went home and told my mother . She looked astonished and me and her went to go confront him. He said, "Who are u gona believe me or your daughter"?. After that it went back to normal like it never happened. When my older sister was 12 our father did the same thing but he was saying sexual explicit things to her for about 2 months. She came foward and told my ma in about 2002, and nothing still happened. He is not a father in  my eyes. He thought that me and my brother were doings things. He hurt me mentally, physically, and most of all emmotionally. Me and my sister went to the police but basically they said that its nothing that we can do. I used to hate him with every single fiber in me. I used to get into heated arguments with him. Then i realized that he's not worth it so i calmed down eventually. But the hardest thing to do is to forgive. I feel him almost watching or undressing me with his eyes. He is perverted, a freak, and a child predator. I hate it when my nieces comes over because I dont trust him around them so i look after them 24/7 when they come ova. But i know in my heart that GOD will punish him for his wrongdoings. I used to get nightmares of me and him doing things because of what he wanted to do with me. Not just me, he did that to my older sister too. I know Im stronger thatn him, he is the devil. He is just an evil spirit that I refuse to win me ova or my sister. My only problem is to forgive him...what should I do? Thankyou and ~GOD BLESS~
