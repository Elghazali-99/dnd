So much has been going on these past few months and idk how to deal with it anymore... I constantly find myself breaking down and having panic attacks.. I've been pushed to my breaking point so many tines that the only thing that's really keeping me going is my daughter and my unborn son... I've been with my husband for 3 years, half of those years he was incarcerated. We recently got married in may and 4 days later he started cheating in me with his ex on mothers day of all days... I've always hated mothers day cuz my mom left 14 years ago n haven't seen her since.. I couldn't get myself to leave him cuz I love him that much and we decided to work on things, which went okay for the most part until he started up with her again faking a relationship with her so he can see his other kids otherwise she won't even let him talk to them. Recently I received in the mail divorce papers... And he believes that if weget divorced our relationship will return to normal but really it makes me even more self conscious now because my birthday is next week I'm 20 weeks pregnant the judge wants to side with him and his ex won't stop harassing me and whenever I trytalkig to him he accuses me of nagging him and it makes me angry and I say things I regret then get so upset I have panic attacks and I uncontrollably cry which is what I'm doing as I wrote this... I'm so badly hurt and no one I know will understand where I'm coming from because they all hate him n are biased I don't even want advice I just want to cry and talk to someone and be happy again... I don't even know how to be happy again idk what to do anymore I can't even talk to him cuz he's working all the time now and I have no real friends everyone I know is 500 miles away... I'm feel completely alone and I just don't know what to do anymore I'm just lost... Seems everything I do is either wrong or just stupid and irritates him... I'm sorry this is so long I just needed to say something before I go crazy...
