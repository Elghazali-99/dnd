I realize that sometimes, to move onward, one must literally take one day at a time, one step at a time, one moment at a time, one breath at a time. And though the last stretch sounds dull, feels like it will never end and is very hard moment by moment, joy can be found in their passing.  I saw and felt something so genuine last night that I so desperately want to share.  
 There are gifts given to us over time through much pain and effort, like affection from a lover, trust from a friend, money from an employer. But other gifts are given freely and instantly without any effort, but they are just as or perhaps more valuable and meaningful.  
 Last night I stepped out to take a long walk because I felt so rejected and sad.  It was like I didn’t exist. I didn’t even have the impact of a ghastly ghost, ‘cause at least ghosts and goblins cause a person to react.  So, I had to get it out of my system and went out for a walk/run alone.  I prayed, sang and meditated (mental medication) about all the things God blessed me with. As I walked back home, I still felt alone. Looking down (as I usually do), I saw the most beautiful thing. 
 Right after dusk, dew settled onto the grass. And, as I walked pass the wet grass, the soft white light of the lamp post lit the little dew droplets and illuminated them to glistened as though I was walking through a pathway filled with little white diamonds.  I had to stop to take a second look because it took me by surprise – it was so becoming and so beautiful. It was like the grass was blanketed with diamonds just for me. In my fascination, I heard a soft voice say – “for you – just because I love you”.  Instantly, my heart received this gift and responded with a soft delicate smile saying inside, “Thank you Lord, I love you too.”   And the night ended with me- alone…. But not lonely….. 
 So, Yes - there is joy in the shadows if you will open your eyes to find the silver lining...
