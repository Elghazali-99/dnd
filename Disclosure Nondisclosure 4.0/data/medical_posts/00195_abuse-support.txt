I was sexually abused for 7 years (5-11) and never told anyone about it. My parents found out about it when I was 14. To this day I have never cried about it, never spoken about it (aside from that one day my parents found out, and even then it was just to confirm to them that I didnt have sex with the abuser...even though I did) So this has seemed for almost my entire life that it isnt a problem aside from the fact that I have various other issues with my family and eating disorders and drugs, cutting etc... In fact the only reason I am writing on here is because I havent cut myself in 4 years unti tonight when for some reason I just started freaking out and didnt knw whatto do, i felt like I was having a panic attack and it was almost instinctual that I reached for something sharp, it was so bizarre because I havent felt like that in years. Also Ive had a shrink for 4 years and I am still seeing her, still very happy with her, yet, we have never really talked about the abuse (though she knows all about it) she refrences it sometimes but she says that to tackle that issue, we first have to tackle all the issues that may or may not have risen from that situation. Still I have no emotion towards this topic, and I feel that I have nothing to say, like its not a part of my life anymore. I guess this really isnt a question, more of just a general enquiring into anyone who may have felt o have been feeling the same thing, and what steps they are taking to overcome, or somehow deal with this. Because I know deep down somewhere there is ovbiously something wrong otherwise I would not be the way that I am...
