I had one person that was very kind in sending me a message - Thank you.
 Please if anyone else can help me with my situation -  I am constipated from being on Lex and have been off Lex for 30 days and I'm still SLIGHTLY constipated?  I am so bloated and I look 4 months pregnant?  Does anyone have any information on this.
I AM SO BLOATED, ITS DISGUSTING!    I am taking a multivitamin with fish oil EVERY DAY and this seems to help me pass once a day but the bloating is not going away??   It's very uncomfortable and does anyone know when this bloating should taper off a bit?  I AM EXERCISING AND EATING RIGHT but for some strange reason my belly is huge????  And I am off  Lex for 30 days now.  I am so FRUSTRATED.  Is anyone having this gross bloating in the belly area?  
 I do feel like the head withdrawls are slowly tapering off a bit -  Less dizziness, less zapping, or sounds in the ears. BUT THE BLOATING IS KILLING ME!   
 AM I GOING TO HAVE THIS FOR A LONG TIME?
Please help me.
