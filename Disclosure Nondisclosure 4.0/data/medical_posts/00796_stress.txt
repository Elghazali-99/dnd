Hi, I posted the following on the Heart rhythm forum but after talking to someone who knows my home situation, she suggested it could be stress related.
 Brief history, up until a year ago when my wife was diagnosed with Delusional problems, for the 5 years previous she accused me of having affairs (unfounded, I haven't cheated on her in 34 years), controlled now with medication, however, she is now suffering with depression / anxiety and for the past year she has become more and more withdrawn.  I have been told by my GP on two occasions that I was showing symptoms of classic stress, heavy nose bleeds for a few days, stomach pains etc.  
 This is whats hapenning now.
 Early December last year I was told that I have Hypercholesterolaemia and I would have to take Simvastatin 40 mg and quit smoking, I'm male and almost 52 yrs old.  I went on Champix to quit and I haven't smoked for 12 weeks and have now finished the Champix, what concerns me now is my BP has always been slightly low, 125 / 75 and my HR around 70, now for the last month my HR has dropped to between 55 to 65, I been getting some dizzyness, feel washed out and have some mild chest discomfort, my GP is sending me for an ECG.  He also told me that nicotine speeds up the HR and so smoking could have masked a problem for years, has anyone got any advice as to what the future holds and what the treatment could be?  
 Also since posting the above, for the past few days now I've felt all jittery, weak and slightly shaky, like when you've just vomitted.  Could this be stress related?
