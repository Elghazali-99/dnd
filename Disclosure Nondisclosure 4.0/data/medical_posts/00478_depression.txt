I am currently on Wellbutrin (150mg/day).  I just started this medication on Sunday.  My Doctor changed me from Paxil because I had gained an ungodly amount of weight in the 6 months that I was on Paxil.  I have also been on:
-Cymbalta (quit because it didn't do anything for me)
-Lexapro (quit becuase of sexual side effects)
 I am having major issues with the Wellbutrin so far.  I have cried every day, I feel helpless, lonely and like I can't take care of myself.  My husband doesn't help me at all.  I feel that he has abandoned me.  He tells me that he is not my mommy or my daddy.  I am 30 years old and my mommy and daddy have basically abandoned me anyways so I don't have one of those.
 I have been having panic attacks for about 2 years now.  They are either daily or every other day.  The Xanax helps but doesn't sometimes.  I sometimes have 5 minute panic attacks and sometimes 2 hour panic attacks.  It just depends and there is nothing that starts them they just start.  I also have some rage issues but sometimes I think it is because I am trying to get my husband's attention and he just doesn't ever say anything.  I don't feel loved by him and I don't know why.  
 It seems that he loves his children with everything he has but not me.  I don't know what is wrong with me but I thought I would post this just to see if I get any replies.  Right now (maybe b/c of the meds) my stomach hurts terribly and my legs ache.  I have heartburn everyday no matter what I eat and it is very painful.  Sometimes I feel like my brain is going to stop...!!  Help or give me advice if you can!
 Thanks!
