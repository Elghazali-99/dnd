I have BPD and im having relationship issues, I am constantly being told that i have a terrible attitude all the time, And everything my girlfriend does seems to get to me, i seem to be having some control issues, ( example: if shes at work and she doesnt call me on her break im tripping out,) meanwhile she texts me and that should be good right? no but it aint! Then theres the trust issue I trust her but then theres times i feel insecure when ive never been given the reason not to be trusting (example if shes at work and she went to the bathroom and wasnt back in a reasonable amount of time that meant she was flirting or wanting to be with someone else...) im always in a bad mood and i have even tried taking medicine such as Wellbutrin, effexor, & some other aintidepressants but nothing seems to work can someone suggest something please i just wanna be able to be good again in my relationship and not let my disorder screw this up.. we have been together for 3 years and i love her with all of my heart... And if your advice is to tell me to stop being controlling and insecure dont bother in responding to my post i need real advice like activities i can do to stop being this way... Thanks
