Okay my ex husband and I divorced almost three years ago over the way he treated me at times and I felt maybe it was just time to move on but during the whole seperation time I kept going back to him wanting him but not wanting to work things out because he pushing it so hard to work things out  I felt like I could not make a good choice on what to do so I moved on and meet a man and almost two years later I remarried I thought was a wonderful person not so has done nothing but cheated on me since we got married now going through another divorce , So now my ex has moved back into town with his new girlfriend and he told me how much he wanted me back but his emotions are mixed up on what to do about this and when we did talk about getting back together  and the next thing I know he's pushing me away and now I can't get him out of my head I need to get over this if he doesn't want me and wants that his girlfriend then why does he even start acting like he wants me back and talking about wanting me back now I am just hurt over this how he is doing me now I need to get past this but I need to know how to get past this does anybody know any advice for this issue?
