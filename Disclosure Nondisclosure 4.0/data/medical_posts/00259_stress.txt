Im 33 &just not realizing how my past affected me i feel like i sabotaged myself and my dreams by lettin my pa
lettin my pass sexual,mental abuse affect me im very intelligent ,but then again im not ,i should have more ,should've done more , im raising 2 autistic kids,i have arthiritis,and fibromyalgyia,my children are my life i love them,and treat them good because deserve it and deserve a way better life then me,but lately i look at myself and feel bad because im just not realizing how much i let all the things that happened to me sabotage my life,it's pretty depressing...,allways putting myself down even though people say im attractive,not having much self worth..i wish i could get those years back ,im tryin but its so hard to open up to people ..im still attracting the wrong people so i've asked God to take all the negative people out my life ,but now its pretty lonely,i would luv to have a healthy relationship but i feel like because i didn't get love as a child i'll be a burden on someone Can anyone else relate?
i've tried the whole dust myself off thing but i dont know wats goin on ..one setback or obstacle over another one..would be nice to have some peace 4 a change...makes me sometime wonder if there is a God
