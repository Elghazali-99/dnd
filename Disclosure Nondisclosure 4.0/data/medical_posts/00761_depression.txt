yesterday I went dr for anxiety and not sleeping at  night. told her about my husband had been on Xanax for about 3 yrs and I have no in, so when my sleeplessness started , and anxiety I took one of his Xanax at times and some times I would  have to take 2mg so she put me on 10 mg of prazac and 1mg of Xanax . my question is I scared to death of the anti-depressant because I have heard good people doing bad things on them I told her I was afraid of them but she insisted I take both. and I thought she was going to give  me a pill so I thought I break it in half and work my way up to the 10 if the half doesn't seem to hurt me, but when I got them filled it was the time released capsule and the druggist said I couldn't break it in half. now im scared to try the Prozac because you don't know how it gonna affect ya till u take it. I do know the Xanax help it doesn't do anything weird for me it actually works, im not a pill popper im afraid of most meds, she wants me back in 3 weeks and she gonna do a urine test on me . will the Prozac show up in the urine if I decide not to take it. it gonna take me a while to get up enough courage to take it , and she wants me to bring my bottles with me too.
