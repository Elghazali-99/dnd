I'm going to let you all know I am about to turn 14 and I used to self harm starting when my parents started fighting. I moved to a new town with my mom and visited my best friend and his brother and noticed his brother being a flirt and being all touchy so after one to two hours of hanging out with them I went home. Later that night his brother messaged me on Facebook and told me he wanted to go out with me and that his brother already gave him a talk so I said yes the next day I went over there to hang out again and he started hitting me for no reason he left bruises on my arms and thighs and everyone thought he would never hit a girl because he watched his dad beat his mom for 15 years. Well I thought he just had an off day and needed to let go of some steam because the next day he was apologizing and being all loving again so I forgave him. I realized the day after that he wasn't having an off day because he beat me so bad that I cried. I never cry for any type of pain. I did fight back a little but he just hit me harder. I had bruises and cuts from him beating me. He broke up with me for someone else the next day. Our moms were good friends so I went to his house a lot. When he got done with that girl he came running back if me and since I'm so stupid I took him back. He abused me for almost a month before I broke up with him. Then he went to my best friend and broke her heart and I don't know why I took him back but I did.  Then he came to my house drunk and left bruises on my face, arms, and legs and had almost succeeded in pushing me into traffic. I know have someone I really love and I haven't cut in almost 9 months and my ex said he was going to tell my mom I cut. What do I do?
