Hi-
 Its been a week since I went to a club in a country where people do not speak English. On the next day after partying, I woke up with a bruise the size of a baseball at one of my sides and my whole body was hurting with no other apparent bruises. People drive like maniacs here so I was thinking I might got hit by a car, but then someone made a joke about being raped. This has worried me so much that I cannot sleep or eat well. I know that when someone gets raped bruises will be present. I am a guy that is now having a panic attack every hour or so for the last week thinking about the thought of me being raped. My anus did not hurt, however, there was some discomfort on my tail bone like when you fall. I do not remember any blood on my underwear or a pain in my anus. Have not really paid attention until someone made the joke. I have been checking my bum everyday to see signs of tear, but do not really know if there would be external or only internal lacerations. I have also been checking the stool for signs of blood for the past days, but cannot really see any as most of it has been mostly liquid. I am new to the city and all the clinics that I know that speak English are closed for the holidays. I know its too late for a rape kit to work, but I will get tested for STD/HIV when the clinic opens. My panic attacks come from the fact that none of my friends know where I went. I just walked out of the party and they found me after about 1-2 hours in zombie mode. I was drinking but do not really know if this was a normal drunk me or a drugged drunk me. I cannot remember anything at all about the incident. What signs does a guy that gets raped show? Please, I really need your help. The thought of being raped is killing me. I am crying right now as I am typing. I need help.
