Hello,
about 2 years ago I started dealing very bad anxiety/panic attacks along with depression. I honestly have no idea why because growing up I was overall a happy child. Anyway, it got so bad that I didn't want to leave the house, crying a lot for no reason, tired a lot, not eating very much, ect. So I saw my doctor and that's when she prescribed me Effexor 75MG. That seriously helped me out so much.. I felt like my normal self, wasn't depressed, didn't barely have any anxiety/panic attack, it worked awesome for me. This year will be almost 2 years of me being out it but in the past month I have notice myself going back to where I started, but not as serve.. I don't think. I am still eating normally, haven't been crying at all, I still go to work and school, all of that. But I can feel myself being depressed (somedays are better then others) my anixeity its getting worse... so I saw my doctor about 2 weeks ago and he suggested that I could try bumping up my dosage to 150MG. I started doing that about a week ago and that whole week I overall felt better...but now this week I feel up and down with it. Is it just because my body is still getting use to the 150mg? or is the Effexor not working anymore? I have a hard time understanding why I am like this. My dad is bi-polar and struggles with depression, but he lived a very bad childhood which seems to be why he is bi-polar now. As for me, idk. I am afraid that I am slowly becoming bi-polar? Right now I am handling a 10 month old, while working during the week, and on top of going to school in the evenings during the week. I don't know if all the stress is effecting everything? I don't know...I just would like someone who can possibly relate to what I am going through and could have some answers. thank you and I would greatly appreciate it.
