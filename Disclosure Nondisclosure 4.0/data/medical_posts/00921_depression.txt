Today is just a really bad day for me, I just feel blah. I don't even know why and that's frustrating me even more. I'm stressed at home and then I come to work and there's more stress here, its so irritating because I put on a happy face and try to get through the day but its so difficult. I've had two pretty big anxiety attacks and when that happens its so embarrassing because I begin to cry for no reason and I have to try to hide it from people so they don't think I'm losing it or something. I'm not happy w/ my job but then again I don't know what I want to do, I feel so lost like I don't even know who I am. I think of all these things that I would want to do and then I remember that I don't have the ability to do it or rather I believe I don't have the ability to do it. I just want to get to a point in my life where I'm genuinely happy, but I'm afraid that may never happen. I feel the same now that I felt before I started my medication over a year ago, so I stopped taking it. I'm so lost I don't know what to do.
