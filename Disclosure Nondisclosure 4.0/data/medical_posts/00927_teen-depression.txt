I'm a thirteen year old girl.  When I'm on my period, I do not get cramps at all.  (hallelujah)  while I'm glad of that, my emotions lose control.  it's almost like hormones are blocking out every normal part of me.  I am the saddest I've ever been in that time, although I'm great at hiding it.  I got my first period a little over a year ago.  I'm aware I have a very long way to go before menopause, but I'm sick of constantly feeling horrible for no reason.  I think I am very fortunate in many aspects of my life and I'm extremely grateful, but the happiness I should feel is nowhere to be found during that time of the month.  As well as sadness, I break out horribly.  Yes, I know not having cramps is a great thing, but I would rather be genuinely happy and in indescribable pain than feeling my worst along with the frustration of not knowing why.  What is a HEALTHY AND NATURAL way to feel better?  I am not depressed.  I know it's just hormones, but I want my hormones to be 10x less crazy.  Let me clarify: it is not just normal sadness. I feel as though I could cry for hours and hours, and I go to bed at either 6:00 pm or 5:00 am.  during my period, I could not possibly hate my body, hair, skin, eyes, style, or anything else more.  thank you for reading whatever this is.  'preciate it :)
