I'm 14 and only in the last months have I began feeling strange. Before then, I was a happy and usually positive person as I have been my whole life. I have always been an over thinker and a worrier but only about general things â€“ nothing like how I feel now. Around New Year's Eve I got ill and was off school for a long time. We were told I had flu and sinusitis and I got antibiotics. Soon the actual illness went away and health-wise I was better. However, since I have recovered I feel like something has changed. Something unexplainable. I have cried too many times and I feel terrified. One night everything felt so abnormal and weird, as though my world had been turned upside down and I was living in a distorted new way, I feel trapped. I don't know what this all is but people just assume I have anxiety. I do, but this feels like something else. I have recently started having weird dreams and nightmares and when I wake up, it is hard to separate what is real and what was a dream. I feel broken and almost like my life has changed forever. This is different to anything I've ever felt. I get scary feelings and the expiriences I have are now related with this feeling, making me dread places. I have lost control of my mind. I have lost my perspective of places I used to feel comfortable in. I feel like fear is shadowing my life , but there is nothing I can do. Please help me, I have run out of options :((((
