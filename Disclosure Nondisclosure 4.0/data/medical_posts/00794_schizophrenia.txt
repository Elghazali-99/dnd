I think I may know what is wrong with me now. For the past year since I had a boyfriend I seem to have all these physical sensations. The sensations are irritable tingly feeling in the spine or a dead depression feeling, anxiety and sometimes I feel happy. These sensations happen throughout the day.  A analogy of how I feel is when a light is flickering off and on.  I feel like that is what is going on in my brain, flickering off and on, then I get really freaked out. It seems like every since I met my boyfriend this has gotten worse. I have never obsessed about depression symptoms before I met him. Now I just notice every sensation in my body, I cant get my mind off of it. Me and my boyfriend always go on nice outings like to the mountains, beach, nice restaurants, but I can never enjoy it because of these physical sensations. I have never had this problem so severe before I met him him.  I have had depression symptoms before but I never obsessed about it before, only this past year.  Could this be Somatization disorder?  along with agitated or psychotic depression?
