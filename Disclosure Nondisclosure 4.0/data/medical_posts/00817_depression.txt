I am a new member. And I do not know how can I post my questions nicely. Any ways let me try.
 The history starts since my wife delivered her first baby (i.e., before 2 years). After my wife delivered a baby she was on a a birth control (BC) loop. After 1 month of the BC, she start experiencing being panic, anxious, crying a lot and feeling dark almost every day. She also disturb me every day and we usually quarrel for no reason. And then her home nurse told me that my wife is in depression state (on July 2010). 
 Then, I took my wife to the hospital for treatment. She took antidepressant medicines, "Lorenzepam" and "Romergon" to relieve her anxiety. And she was under these antidepressant until Dec 2011 (i.e., she took AD for 6 months).
 And after Dec 2011 she was out of any AD. And I thought that everything is going well. BUT her depression starts again on Oct 2012 (she start to be panic, anxious and negative minded). Then we decide to takeoff the BC loop of my wife. And we took the BC loop on Dec 2012. 
 After she is off from BC loop, she is not panic, not anxious. BUT, she lost her concentration and is not able to perform any of her daily life activities. And some times she is laughing without any reason.
 Now, I do not want her to start the AD medications again as they have several side effects. However, in the mean time, i would like her to regain her concentration again. And also I do not want her laughing for no reason.
 So was her depression related to the BC loop only?? And is there any possibility to regain her concentration back to normal naturally??
 Currently she is taking Omega 3 fish oil.
 I need your help in this regard.
