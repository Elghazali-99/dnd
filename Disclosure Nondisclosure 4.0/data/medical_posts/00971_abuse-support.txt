Today on the message of someone here who has posted questions ( any one who posts giving help here ) there was a remark made by the same person who has done this repeatedly , on the experience and validity of some of us answering  questions on the Abuse Forum, I would like for my sake and others to clarify that I personally do have an intimate knowledge of abuse as do the others who try to help,I am sure.One  of my daughters was  abused she  was only 5 year old when it started ,I was a working Mom at the time and busy with a life of my own and my eyes were not wide open, the perpetrator was her Gran pa and he lived with a grand ma on  her Dads side  ,and so it seemed fine to allow my daughter to go there a lot ,as usual she was told he would go to prison and no one would believe her any way,it was severe abuse. To this day my daughter suffers from what she went through my family all have suffered ,and I can never forgive myself for going to work and not even seeing what was going on.I have also suffered mostly mental abuse in a marriage . I write this as my own validation on why I come here each day to help other Folks going through similar , I do not value 'Anna' making a statement like that .
