I read this article about a fraternity brother sexually assaulting a member of his own fraternity while he was passed out. The person had no idea until he stumbled upon photos on the assailant's computer later on. (Some of you might have read about this in the news a few years back.)
These stories kind of make a person wonder about all the times they drank and blacked out or passed out. At first, I was thinking wtf.. but then I saw online that this kind of stuff is not that uncommon.
 Here are a few questions I'd be interested in hearing your opinions and answers on:
 1. Is it possible to have been anally raped without any recollection if you were passed out from drinking? Wouldn't there be fragments or flashbacks if the person can remember most of the night's events?
 2. If the person does not remember anything, wouldn't they at least feel something wrong when they wake up? Even if the assailant was careful to be gentle, wouldn't the person feel it the next day?
 3. What are the symptoms? If there were no sign of any of these symptoms when the person woke up/ the next day, is it still possible that it happened?
