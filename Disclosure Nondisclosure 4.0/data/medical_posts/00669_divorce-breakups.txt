I'll try to make a long story short....My husband and I are highschool sweathearts,we have been together 30yrs,married 25....we have been constantly fighting the past two yrs, it's never been great,but lately it's been horrible, we have been in and out of conseling, the past 6mnths we have seriously talked of divorce,and have even been living in seperate bedrooms, but still having ya know,anyway,...I thought he was trying to hide part of our savings, and yesterday I called him on it,and I told him I wanted to see all the statements for the last 4mnths,and he went balistic,he told me we had blank amount in there and that was all and I shouldn't worry about it I should trust him, I told him I wanted his password to see the accts for myself, after an arguement,and him locking himself in his room for an hr with the phone,he came out and calmly said I could have the password,and oh there was really blank in there (a few thousand more than he originally told me,but still not what I thought), now my question is and again I made a very long story short,but is he lying about the money,? and if he is, is he hiding it,so I won't spend it,or is he hiding it so when he files for divorce he will have a little nest egg?...please any advice will be appreciated.Can a person hide money,isn't it tracked by their social security number?
