I saw that 'sleep problems' was an appropriate topic for this forum, so I'm hoping for the benefit of you good folks' expertise. It's odd, I don't want to wake up once asleep, but getting to sleep is extremely difficult. Here's what works ninety percent of the time: 1 lunesta or sonata (whichever is available to me at the time), 2 ounces of Nyquil, 2 over the counter sleep aids (50 mg of whatever puts the 'PM' in 'Tylenol PM') and one mg xanax. Ninety percent of the time that combo puts me out in an hour or so. Subtract the 1 mg of xanax, which I often don't include in order to avoid developing a tolerance, and the success rate drops to perhaps sixty or seventy percent, and it takes a couple of hours to work. What I'd like to know is if you folks have any suggestions regarding what I might ask the VA people to provide that might be powerful enough to knock me out for the night, yet not be as destructive of my liver as I've been led to believe the combinations I use now are.  Has anyone any suggestions, please? Thank you very much in advance for your time.
