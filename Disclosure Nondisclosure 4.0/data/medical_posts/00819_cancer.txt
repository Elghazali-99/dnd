Ok so now I am having real panic set in. I went through my head all the tests they put me through when I was 20-23. I had at least 8 ct scans, they found nodules on my lings and kept rescanning me. I had countless xrays, upwards of 50. I had bari swallows with xray and had a cathedar with radiation injection and a nuclear stress test....all to find out I have an arrythmia! I prob am forgetting some too. Doesnt this put me at an extreme risk now? I cant even believe how many tests that put me through. If I had only known what it could do to me, I would have spoken up. I am really having a panic attack. I have been having bad gas that dowsnt change with diet, EXTREME fatigue, and stool that floats and is tan! I am terrified all this radiation has given me cancer. I am 30 and have two children under two that I am soley responsible for. This fatigue has really hit me these last two weeks, I feel like I could fall asleep driving! Has anyone had a lot of radiation tests and NOT gotten cancer years later because of it?
