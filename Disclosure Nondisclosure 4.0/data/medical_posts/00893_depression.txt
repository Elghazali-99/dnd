I have wanted my son off zyprexa for awhile.  Everytime he comes off an amount by the 3rd day he gets sucidal.  how do I wean him off safely?  How do you wean off this medication slowly and safely.  It has never helped his depression, he has started lithium and seems okay, he was extremely senitivie to all medications, like zoloft prozac, all very bad.  he was going to the hospital to get off zyprexa safefly but because they read into the withdrawls instead of who he was they wouldn't take him off anything unless he was on something else.  I am so tired to doctors telling me to go off zyprexa but put him something else.  It doesn't work, because you don't know which medicine is giving him the withdrawls.  For all the people taking zyprexa, my son is living proof you can get very bad side effects coming off zyprexa.  It happens every time the doctors have tried.  If there is anyone out there who can tell me how to wean his off very slowly and safely.  He is on 2.5 mg on day, not much now but he was on 15 mg day and its been very difficult and dangerous to get him down to this amount.  Does anyone know how to do this 1 a week, one every 3 days, any help from a doctor I would really appreciate this.
