Hi All
 Its been 5 months i have been seperated from my husband and we are now in the process of Divorce. This all happened due to his obsessive family and they have brainwashed him to believe me and my family are bad. I loved him sooooo much and we were best friends for 12 years, we only hung out together so our social life with friends was fairly minimum. Issues arose after marriage - living with his family. They didnt warm to me and as with any new environment it takes time to adjust... when his siblings were wrong no one stood up for me not even my husband. It got to the point his mother told me to go back to my mum's. I refused.. Incidents were created petty things and i was then dropped to my parents home twice. 2nd time round, which is the most recent i decided that enough was enough and they couldnt keep dropping me. Over the last 4 mths he has insulted me and my family  to no end and refused to meet me only if i apologised on something his family had fabricated and plotted. I refused to say sorry and base my marriage on a lie. He was the most charming and caring guy behind closed doors, but in front of his family he was in full support of them  and would put me down and he said he was wtaching me and testing me how i would be around his family. I still love him.. my mind says he is no good but my heart is missing him. He wont respond to any emails or messages and is making our friends cut off from me. Do you think i am doing the right thing, or should i just go back?
