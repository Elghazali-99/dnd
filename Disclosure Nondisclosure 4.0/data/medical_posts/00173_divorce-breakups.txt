Hello, I am sure a million and one fed-up spouses ask this question but here I am yet again asking myself and all of you... Do I stay or do I ... go? And How?
I have been married for 10 years to what they call a functioning alcoholic. We have two children together, our son is 6 and our daughter is 5. My husband drank prior to our marriage so I was not blind getting into our marriage just a fool. However, his drinking has gotten worse and the fear of getting hit is no longer just a fear. Two weeks ago.. he struck me for the first time. (chipped a tooth) he has always called me every name in the book and threatened to "knock me out" but he did it, he hit me and the act of him hitting me hurt worse than the hit itself. I never believed that he would do it... Before everyone goes on a tirade telling me to call the police and so on... I know now that I should have called the police, but I didn't so that ship has sailed. When I attempted to call the police that night... my phone flew into the wall and I was terrified of him waking the kids up and them seeing any of this. But what is done is done... My question is what to do now? I do not work and have not for 6 years... since the birth of our son. That night is stuck in my head and no matter the amount of apologies I hear, I can not except them. I am not angry anymore, just need to find an out I think. We had two years of mirage counseling and he was dry for a whooping 5 months.. I am tired, fed up, unemployed and terrified of what it means to actually send him packing. I do not even know how that conversation starts...
