Hey guys, I've been under a great deal of stress for the last ten years and haven't had too much trouble coping with it. I've been through so much, but I stay optimistic and focused on the future. These last few months I have developed a terrible, terrible stress disorder. Panic attacks, derealization (at times) and generalized anxiety. It kind of feels like I'm dreaming, or tripping on a low dose of shrooms or something. I quit smoking marijuana because of these anxiety issues. Anyways, I fought the illness with everything that I had, and guess what... I'm winning the fight! I kept a journal every day for how bad my anxiety was and when it happened as well as meditated and used breathing techniques. But, in the last 2 weeks or so, as my anxieties are fading away, I've developed constant heart palpatations, and I generally feel half drunk most of the day. These feelings do not appear with panic attacks or anxiety and thats what scares me. Could my stress levels (which are still high, though I'm recovering) cause my heart to act so crazy? I just don't get it, and its making this fight with my own demons much harder. I'll just be sitting there, watching a movie, and then BANG! My heart is skipping beats and such. Also, I've been getting chest pains that do not accompany my palpitations. The chest pain radiates into my left arm and usually lasts about 5 to 10 minutes. Could stress be causing this?
