im an 18 year old girl.i think im being molested.im not sure though.my sister has told me that my dad looks at me in a bad way.she told me that she has noticed him looking at my breasts.i dont know whether to believe it.my mother has cautioned me not to wear revealing clothes in front of my dad..i come from a really conservative family.my dad is a touchy kind of guy.
i read online that children who have been molested many a times start masturbating really young.my dad has abused my mother physically and mentally.my mom has faced marital rape by my dad.my dad has toned down his temper over the last years.but u know occasionally if i try to do something he doesnt like he tells me that he should have had his old abusive behaviour.then he warns me saying that one day he would teach me a lesson.he is like dr jekyll and hyde.turns violent quickly.he always tries to hit only me and not my elder sister or younger brother becos im not physically very strong.i started masturbating when i was really young.at that time i didnt even know what sex is.i dont kow how i learnt to do it.i also dont remember much of my childhood.my family has told me that i always was a really quite child and extremely over mature for my age.like i was withdrawn into a shell.apparently used to always sit in a corner of my house and read very quitely.and it seems i was not naughty at all.i remember i used to get very scared to leave my mother and go somewhere. many a times he has hit me on my butt.
i have an elder sister and a younger brother.i always feel he has been extra violent with me.once when i was 16 he saw me coming out of the bathroom only wearing a towel and he started smiling weirdly.lately a picture has been popping into my head.a picture of my dad giving me a bath when i was young and rubbing hard on my private part.i dont know whether it is my imagination or a supressed memory.i asked my mother about it and she said my dad has never given me a bath.i also get this picture of him asking me to sit on his lap and to kiss him on his face again and again.he always tries to come near me as a way of making my sister jealous..that is as if he is showering more affection on me.im 18 now.he recently literally forced me to come and sit near him.he grabs me.he dragged me to a room once in anger and just shoved me.whenever i sit near him he rubs my leg with his leg.he always asks me to come and ssit near him.once he kissed my neck.once in public he rested his chin on my shoulder from the back and didnt let me go even when i asked him to.another time when we had a fight i got angry and went to my room.
he came in and held me tightly and tickled me till i accepted his sorry.most of the time he is a nice dad.but he quickly turns violent on me.he leers at me.once when i was 15 and i was returning from my classes at night.this stranger was walking alongside me.i just simply smiled at him and he suddenly started showing me a video of people having sex.and i got scared and started to walk away from him.but then he caught up with me and asked me questions like have u ever tried this and do i want to try it and all.i luckily escaped.the fact was after that my dad was continously staring at me for days in this totally weird way.yesterday my mom warned me that my dad was looking at my breasts.i have this fair pretty cousin and he used to stare at her till one day she told him off.he looks and comments at other women in front of me.he has had affairs.he has once told me that he will put a spy on me as i turn older.when i see strangers somehow i get this feeling of wanting to be viloently raped by them.but then wen i actually think about it i feel disgusted.im ashamed of all these thoughts of sex.i get ashamed because im masturbating.and i .i get uncomfortable around him.once i wore a new dress and showed it to him and he went on staring at me in a weird way.when i was 15 i had a really good guy friend who used to call me everyday.when my dad found out he hit me and threatened to lock me in the house if i continued talking to that guy.whenever i talk to guys my dad stops me.he doesnt allow me to talk to guys.when i was young i used to have fantasies of being tied up and tortured.as i turned older the fantasies turned to brutal rape.is this a hint that it had happened to me and that i have blocked it out?i have been having fantasies of getting raped by my dad in a really brutal way.he has also mentally and emotionally abused me.i get uncomfortable talking to guys.i want to know whether this is molestation or am i reading too much into it.is my dad molesting me?please answer fast.i have been in depression for more than two years.i do not have anybody to talk to.i cannot tell my family.they are not supportive.i cannot go to a counsellor neither can i run away.recently he told me that he is going to put a spy on me.when he hits me..it is like he has total feeling of power over me.once he forced me to lie down on his lap and i could feel his erection.another time he backed me against the cupboard in anger and held me against my will with his fingers squeezing my mouth in anger.im scared he will rape me.
 1) yesterday i was sitting in the room with two of my cousins.he came to the room and asked me for a favour.i said okay.he was standing in my back.he put my hair in the front and started rubbing my neck.then i got this scary intuition that he would soon rape me.should i trust my intuition?
 2) i cant go to the police.my mom wont testify.i cant do this to my family.it will break us.my mom will get depressed again.i cannot afford to do that.i do not have anyone who will believe me.
 3) sometimes my dad acts so nice.really believe me so nice that i feel really guilty for thinking like this about him.i love him but i hate him.this confusion is killing me.
 4) the other day my sister commented to my dad that he has become fat.i was lying down on the sofa.my hand was partially covering my butt.he came and asked me is it true?and i replied yes.then he playfully slapped me on my butt even though he could have just spanked my hand or whatever.what do i take of this?this has happened thrice.even if i cover my butt.is he doing it purposely?
 5) do fathers touch their daughters this way in affection?
 6) i have been depressed from the past three years.
 i get ashamed and feel weird when people talk about sex or joke about rape or molestation.
 my dad is a loser.i should be saying this but its true.sometimes i feel that the only place he has power is when he is sexually abusing me.
 im getting weird feelings that tells me im going to be raped by him.
 im not able to concentrate on anything else in life."
  please please please help me!!!
