I am preparing to exit my marriage from a man that has emotionally and verbally abused me for almost 12 years.  We are buying a home together, have no children together, but I have 2 kids living with us.  I also have 3 dogs and my oldest child, who is in college and lives with us, has 2 dogs also.  I've talked with my husband several times about divorce, but he simply will not agree to it.  He has become extremely possessive and made references about suicide several times if we divorce, to the point that I've removed the firearms from our home.  I've been told by my therapist and a counselor at a local womens shelter that I need to leave the house as soon as possible, but it's not that simple for me.  I have a teenager who is being affected by this, but she loves her step dad very much, and I hate to move her out of the comfort of her home.  I know that a lot of people might consider this unimportant, but I also love my dogs too, and can't bear to part with them, and I've been so isolated that I have no friends or family that  I can leave them with so that I can get out, and I can't find a house or apartment to rent that will accept that many pets.  Does anyone think that I have a chance of legally getting my husband to leave the house, so that I can stay, or should I leave and make some really heartbreaking decisions?
