My gynecologist prescribed me lo loestrin fe to help with irregular and painful periods. I started taking it  the first day of my period, Dec 25. I continued to bleed until Jan 20 (CD 27/the last white pill before the brown placebo pills) I also had sex on Jan 21 around 1:00 AM using the withdraw method correctly. I took a pregnancy test Jan 28 and it was negative. I was also having my usual PMS symptoms (backache, bloating, cramps, dizziness, nausea, breast tenderness) & then started bleeding like a normal (heavy) period on Jan 29 (would be around the time my next period would have been if I did not start birth control. my cycles were around 33-35 days) which lasted until Feb 3 (6 days). I took a first response early detection pregnancy test with 1st AM urine on Feb 5 (16 days after sex) & it was negative. Since then I have been having nausea, breast tenderness, fatigue, mild cramps, headaches, dizziness, depression & major anxiety which are also side effects of the pill for the first 3 mths. In the past I have fooled myself into thinking I was pregnant multiple times when I have never been.  I am worried that I may be pregnant despite having bled for 27 days straight on the pill, using the withdraw method (only time we have not used condoms), having my period  and having 2 negative pregnancy tests. I also take my birth control every single day to the minute & have never been late, skipped a pill, or taken anything to interfere with the effectiveness. What do you all think?
