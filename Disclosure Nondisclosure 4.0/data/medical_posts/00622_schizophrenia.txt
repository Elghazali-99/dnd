Hi these are all my symptoms and I'm scared of having schizophrenia. Sorry it's a long list hoping someone can help:
Losing my senses
Loss of reality
Feeling that the world is not real
Blank mind
Trouble socializing 
Feeling depressed 
Feeling detached
Afraid of schizophrenia
Not hearing voices but not feeling like I'm doing is real
Will feel happy once in the day and than unreal the next
All I want to do is sleep I only feel normal when I dream
Very panicked
Feels like depersonalization or derealization
Afraid of my surroundings and to move
When it gets so bad I shake or feel awful dropping feelings in head or chest
Not recognizing myself in the mirror
Hard time concentrating or remembering 
Feeling I'm in a dream world
Happened after I had a huge PANIC ATTACK last Sunday
I will zone out and not know where I am and than zone back in also not knowing where I am
Can't read or write or talk at times
Lack of appetite and weight loss
Feeling not real like it's all a dream
Can't concentrate 
Can't think at times but can write stuff down 
Can't cry but feels like laughing at times when I feel more like myself
Spaced out into nothingness
Feels like I am going to go unconscious at times or that I already am
Feeling that I'm seeing life but actually in it
Symptoms are hard to explain
My body is doing things but my mind is not comprehending that they are being done but they are
Focused so much on what's wrong and not focusing on the outside world 
Afraid of losing my mind
Disney feels like one bad dream
Bad memory at times can picture thing but not remember them clearly
Feels like I go unconscious for a second and then goes back to reality
Feels people aren't real around me
Depressed and hopeless
Symptoms are getting worse 
Numb hands and shooting pain up the leg 
Eyes detached and twitching
Period
Bloody noses 
All I want to do is sleep
Want to go back to normal
I don't know if I'm so focused on my thoughts I will do stuff and than come back to reality and be like what
My mind will drift in and out of what seems to be another world or nothing
