I'm 16 always been depressed. Getting some help at school and i guess from two friends. One of my friends can't help cuz she just wont or shes just sad herself. My other friend is suicidal... so ya. Ok so i like don't really like very many things anymore. Im only interested in like a couple of things. Like i like writing screen plays and playing guitar. But besides that I would rather die. My friends are dicks and i just feel lonley whenever im with them. When I spoke to the counsellor yesterday I was like yay i feel pretty good. But like an hour later and i was like im going to end it tonight. Of course I don't really want to die I just want this to all be over. But im pretty sure its never going to get better. Ive always dealt withthis ****. And now it just really hurts. I have a way that I want to kill myself, but im not sure it will work. like i pretty much take suicide as a one time thing. If your going to do it do it right. so like Im just not sure if it will work. I just really want this all to be over but I know that Ill be hurting people. Like a lot of family and a couple friends (i dont have many). I guess I dont want to die, like if i could i would want to enjoy life. But I just don't , i never truthfully have.
