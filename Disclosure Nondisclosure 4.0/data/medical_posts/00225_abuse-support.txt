I want to know how I can possibly get pregnant. If you stop right here, that sounds funny, but no seriously, I have had a tubal ligation (not sure if I had them seared) but I want to know if I can somehow still get pregnant. I cannot afford a  reversal even if it was available. I am 37 years old with three beautiful children. They are all girls, however I only have custody of one. I am hoping this does not sound like a pity session, I am solely trying to set and obtain a goal of getting pregnant. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused. I truly deserved this one. I did not know him well enough before I got married I would have known he had six prior restraining orders from other wives before I met him, but I trusted him. Being so familiar with the court system with all his priors, which does not include the 28 violent offences he has been charged with, he is a tough fight. I don't want to elaborate too much, but I was abused and I was pregnant with our last when I was so damaged that I decided I would never have children again. Especially since a lot of the abuse occurred during my pregnancies. I need to know what my options are.
