Well here goes. I'm 44 and have been married 23yrs, we've been together 28. we were high school sweethearts started dating me 16 her 15, she is all I've ever known. We have a 19yr daughter and our son will be 17. our marriage has been nothing but a loveless one for along time.I hate to say this if it wasn't for my son I think we wouldve ended it 16 yrs ago. There is no love or affection in our home. I used to tell my wife that I loved her several times a day and she would say it back out of being courteuos but never has my wife told me she loves me, we never have any type of affection  I havent really kissed my wife in at least 4-5 years. there is no passion nothing.Sex is once every 2-3 months and is basically a chore for her. we have never gone away just the two of us, I've asked and there is always a excuse or its with the kids. She blames me for everything in the marriage. we live like roomates and will go weeks not really talking. every time I think about getting a divorce I feel guilty. I look at all the pictures in the house and all we have together(nice house, yard etc) all the time invested, and think do I want to loose all this, but is material things worth a rest of my life being unhappy. I don't think we can continue like this!
I see 2 counselors and both think it's time to move on, because this has gone on for years. I love my wife and always will but that IN LOVE feeling is gone and she says she loves me and doesnt want a divorce cuz it will mess the kids up for life and she's proud that we've been together this long when people comment. but who cares what people think! just looking for advice should I go or stay in something that will never really change. Thanks
