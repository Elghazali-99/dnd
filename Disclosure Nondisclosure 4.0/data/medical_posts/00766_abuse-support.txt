Hello,
 The other day I was hanging out with my daughter and I could see she was clearly upset. I asked her what was wrong but she didn't say anything at first. At first I let it go but a few hours later I asked her again. Something was clearly bothering her. 
 She told me the other day when she was home at her mothers (FYI, we're divorced) she was drying her hair in the bathroom when she noticed an ipod phone peeking from under the door jam as if someone was taking pictures using the phone/cam. The door has a size able gap and when she saw it it really freaked her out. She mentioned prior to that she and her step-dad were uploading pics from his iphone to picassa. When he was looking away she saw pics of herself, nothing revealing but unsettling nonetheless. Lastly, before school she always has her mom and step-dad give her outfit a 'once over' before heading out the door. One time, according to my daughter, her mom wasn't home and she asked her step-dad to make sure her outfit was OK to wear. Well he went up to her and as he was adjusting her clothes he 'slightly' groped her.
 I'm torn at this stage. I'm fuming with so much hatred but I want to do the right thing. My daughter said everything is OK and that they all had a talk at the dinner table. My girl told her mom who in turn confronted him but of course he denied it. She would never make any of this stuff up. She's going to be 18 this year and leaving for college. She and her mom have been living with this guy for over 3 years now and this suddenly happened. At the very least I told my girl that she can move in with me. As far as I'm concerned she can finish her senior year in high school and stay with me when she attends college.
 What do regarding this guy???
