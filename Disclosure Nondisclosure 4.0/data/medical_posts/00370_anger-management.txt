So yesterday while in the shower I asked my husband if there was anything he can do for his snoring. He snores extremely loud and I am 7.5 months pregnant and now with my frequent potty breaks at night Ive noticed it more.  Omg I wish i didnt ask him that he justs started screaming and cursing.  I mean he gets like this once in a while but not since i have been pregnant. Ive been married for five years.  I get extremely scared of him when he is like this cause he starts punching things like first in the begginning it was the shower curtain rod he broke off and bended it into pieces, then the mirror in the bathroom he smashed , then the hole in the wall he puched and he has thrown things too. And now yesterday night a even bigger hole in another wall that he decided to punch.  He even tore my pillow i had since i was a year old.  Of course I cry and that makes him angrier.  He goes on like this for a while and he always blames me for getting him like this. I hate him when he is like this.  I dont know what to do.  I try and stay quiet while this happens cause it only seems to make him worst when i speak.  But now I have reached a point where I am extremely scared and dont know what to do cause I dont want to have my baby be around this.  I have asked him to seek help but the empty promises has gotten old and so is the "i'm sorry". What should I do?
