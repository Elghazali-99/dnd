Hello. Well i am not completely sure if this has anything to do with Depression, however i have noticed that my feelings towards my family are not as they should be. I dont know why, It feels as if i may be searching for a new family. I dont really want to be around them much and i dont ever open up to them. They do give me lectures and yell and scream alot and they seem to be bringing lots of my anger and anxiety. They dont mean to, infact things have improved, but i dont know why i feel worse about them. i daydream about others being my family instead, e.g my teachers or celebrities on TV. Or evensomeone else's parents. I KNOW I AM A HORRIBLE PERSON! I feel so bad about it, but i cant help feeling this way. I dont want to discuss any of my problems with them because it makes me feel really uncomfortable. So i try to avoid them and close myself up in my room. I dont know what is wrong with me.....why am i not happy or comfortable with my family, while they love me to pieces??!
P.S. This is the same as the previous post because i DESPERATELY need some advice....and no one answered me......   :( :(
