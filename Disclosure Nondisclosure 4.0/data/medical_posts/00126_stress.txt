So im not sure if this is depression or stress or some neurological thing, but i thought i would ask here before my doctors appointment Monday just to get an idea.
 For the past few days ive been feeling really, out of it is the only real way to put it. Im pretty tired, and it feels like im in sort of a brain fog,  i cant really concentrate. It also feels like really aware , like...i cant fully relax or do something without my brain telling me in feeling funny.  
 I've had trouble sleeping all my life and usually couldn't fall asleep before the sun started coming up(despite laying in bed for hours). So i put up a thick blanket to block out the light so when i  could fall asleep at dawn when i was finally tired enough. I've been doing that for like a year but it makes me over sleep. I would wake up late, but never feel like i do now. Im anxious and my brain feels fuzzy and in worried, which is making me anxious. I took down the blanket because lately ive been able to fall asleep early, like 10 or so because im so tired. 
 Should i be worried?
