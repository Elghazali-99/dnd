I am nearly 27 and my partner is 36. We have been together 2 and a half years. I met him very shortly after I broke up with a man I was deeply in love with. It was far far too soon but I went along with it, in retrospect, as a distraction. Very quickly it became apparent that my new boyfriend was very controlling, manipulative and at times cruel. As a result, I have always had one foot out the door, always expecting to leave him. Yet, years later I have never found a way. I feel extremely anxious whenever I've tried to leave. However, as is so often the case with this sort of man, he can also be wonderful. He makes me cry with laughter, is incredibly charming and clever and when he wants to be, is fantastic. 
 I am so drained and exhausted from walking on eggshells all this time, trying to 'get it right' so that he doesn't explode or/and judge. However, now he is very worried about his health. He has lost a lot of weight very quickly, has strange symptoms and has a lump in this throat. The first lot of blood tests have come back all Ok and hence his Doctor has said that it is not cancer... but they still don't know what is wrong and he is scared. Whenever I mentioned that I am not happy together, he brings up how scared he is that he's dying and how much he needs right now.
 On top of this, I bumped into my ex boyfriend recently. We ended up sleeping together. I have never cheated on a partner before and feel sick with myself, but at the same time it felt so right to be back with someone who I connected with so deeply. I've never felt that way about my current partner. 
 I am so angry at my current partner, but feel so guilty. I want to just end the relationship and be away from it all but he is so scared and sounds so lost that I do not know what to do. 
 What should I do?
