Dear Doctors,
I am a GBM, stage IV patient. Please tell me about the meaning of my last MRI. Following is my last MRI report.
QUOTE:
Description: MRI Brain with contrast
Clinical history: 48F, Rt temporal lobe GBM, completed 15mo TMZ For surveillance. 3mo
MRI BRAIN
PROCEDURE: Multiplanar MR imaging og the brain was performed without and with contrast.
Comparison: MRI Feb 26, 2015
FINDINGS:
Again seen is the prior right temporoparietal craniotomy with a surgical cavity in the right temporal lobe. The bandlike enhancement along the superior aspect of the surgical cavity is unchanged as is the thin smooth rim enhancement along the medial aspect of the surgical cavity. The nonenhancing FLAIR hyperintensity in the right temporal pole and in temporal lobe posterior to surgical cavity extending to the the right peritrigonal area, posterior right internal and external capsules and right periventricular deep WHITE matter is GROSSLY UNCHANGED.
There is a CLUSTER of small enhancing nodules along the right lateral cerebellum and right brachium pontis with minor susceptibility AND mild high FLAIR signal. These are also grossly unchanged.
Multiple punctate nonspecific nonenhancing foci of FLAIR hyperintensity in periventricular and deep WHITE matter.
IMPRESSION: No significant change to the right temporal cavity and associated enhancement and surrounding high FLAIR signal.
A CLUSTER of small enhancing nodules along the right lateral cerebellum and right brachium pontis with minor susceptibility and mild high FLAIR singnal that are also grossly unchanged
