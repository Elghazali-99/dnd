I'm currently unable to be diagnosed as BPD since I don't meet the age requirement for personality disorders. Although, my psychiatrist and my different therapists agree I'm a severe case of it according to my history and current diagnosis. What I worry about is that I have a very passionate interest in serial killers, and this past year I've recognized several symptoms I share with the average killer. My therapists say that my fascination with them and all the gruesome things they do is from my personal interest in pain, emotions, and being in control. I have very strong, violent fantasies accompanied by violent paraphilias such as sadomasochism; strong attractions to blood, murder, rape, etc.; and attractions to convicts or people who commit violent crimes. I am also a female. I find myself exploring masochism and watching violent forms of pornography. I know this won't guarentee me becoming a serial killer, I just notice that I have many common interests, symptoms, and urges that match the earlier stages of killers like Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy, Richard Rivera, etc. I just wonder if my concern should be made more real.
