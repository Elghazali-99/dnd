Well im 23weeks preg. and i live with my boyfriend (baby daddy) we also work together. He talks about killing me (explicit detail) he will put a knife to me and pretend to shoot me. we will get into an argument and i try to walk away cause ive had enough an he will bind me an make me stay there get in my face and choke me until i complay to everything he says...he is very verbally abusive i am schizo and well it dose not help..but that is not my concern...im worried about the reality of what he is cabable of...he is very controling he says its cause he loves me to much to let me walk away but i know thats a bunch of bs. he broke the handle on our door so i cant just open it i half to take a butter knife to the door to open it. he wont let me have a phone and he wont let me go anywhere or do anything alone hince why we work together. he puched me once. if i leave i feel he will kill me. and i also think that he will fight me for the baby...so what do i do?...i dont really have any family and he has ran off all my friends...i do not think he will hurt the baby when we do fight he tells the baby he is sorry he dose not want to hurt you only your momma...but will he hurt me to the point of hurting his child without relizing is what i fear...
