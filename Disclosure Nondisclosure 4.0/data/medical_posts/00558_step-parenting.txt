Hi there, am a mother of a 5 year old little boy.  His dad and I have been separated since he was 20 months. He's married now. My ex is hands on dad and we've been sharing custody for our son but recently my son told some disturbing things his stepmom has been saying to him. 
She once had a fight with my ex and threatened to stab him and she repeatedly said to my Ex that " he should do her a favour and leave with his house and take his son with him" my son heard the threats and according to my son he say the step mom threatening to stab his dad and police wee called by the neighbors.
 Prior before that incident. They went away for New Years with my son and their 3 yr old daughter but to my surprise my son came back home after the break and told he never wanted to go back as he was left to sleep with strangers as his step mom sent him off to spend a night with strangers as her, his dad and their daughter spent a night in a diffrent hotel room.
I was so hurt but when I contacted the dad he denied it. He's also still defending his wife after the knife incident. 
I've now stopped from taking our son to his house but am hurting as a mother cos my son is hurting cos he really missed his dad. 
I asked the dad to find ways of spending time with his son without his wife as am no longer comfortable sending my son to their home but he keeps taking him there. I feel she no longer wants anything to do with my child.
Please help he threatening to take me to court and bullying me. Am I wrong in any way this is tearing me apart. My son loves his dad and his little sister but am very concerned about her being in his life. It seems lije she's threatened by little man.
