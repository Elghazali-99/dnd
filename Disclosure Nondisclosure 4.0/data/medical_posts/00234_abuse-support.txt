well my wife's family suffers from bipolor and i know she does to,but she won't see a doctor she has times when she is the most delightful person to be around,but without warning she can change with no cause to being the devil in my wife's body. when she has these moments she treats everyone like they just killed her favorite dog.she treats our seven year old daughter like a slave.When she has these moments she is always angry if she says to do something everyone had better get up and do it no matter what time it is or how stupid it is. when she gets like this I always stay by my daughter's side cause  my wife  always goes after her to make her do a bunch of stuff to try and make her cry on purpose.when i tell her to leave her alone she says courtney get your shoes on where leaving hell it could be 10 or 11 at night and instead of walking she will walk just to **** me off more cause she has my daughter walking in the middle of the night.one time i called the cops well she made it home before they got there and started throwing stuff and screaming at the top of her lungs i even had family members present,When the cops got there she completely changed her attitude. She started crying and told the cops i was lying and she wasnt throwing anything or screaming.I told them she was treating courtney like a dog and was dragging her around by the arm even the family members told them,but the cops wouldn't believe me they said these are your family members they would lie on your behalf.and they said if we ever called again they would make sure they took my daughter.I didn't give me any help or  hope she verbaly abuses everyone in the family this is why we don't have any friends because of the way she is she abuses our little girl all the time she makes her cry everyday.I dont know what to do I can't afford a lawyer cause she completely ruined my credit.even when she has no money she goes shopping just to see what she can buy when she gets money.when she has spent every penny she has thats when it gets real bad cause she cant shop so it puts her in a mood where if you do something that she don't like she freaks out on everyone and then she takes the little one and leaves dragging her kicking and screaming. anytime her and i are playing and having fun she makes us stop cause she doesn't want us to have a good relationship.all i want is for my wife to get help ,but she wont willingly go what can i do how can i make her go how can i make her see what everyone else sees
