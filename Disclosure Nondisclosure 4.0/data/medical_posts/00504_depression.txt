I have been on effexor xr, 300mg a day for approx. 13yrs.  During that time I went off a couple times, about 5 and 6yrs ago. I remember it being horrible, but because of my completely non-existent memory, I don't remember all of it.  I know only one other person who has been on effexor xr almost as long and we have similar problems with our health.  I can't find anything on the internet about the long term effects on your body, like kidneys, etc. and wondered if anyone knows?  I am on my first day of cutting the 300 in half, so I am ok, but I know and am very scared about what's to come.  I went on the med for severe depression and anger issues and I really hope it doesn't come back.  I am going off of it because all I want to do now is sleep or sit on the couch and watch tv.  I have no motivation  or desire to do anything, and have no goals for the future.  Not exactly where I should be right now in my life:(  I am also having medical problems and wonder if any are from the effexor xr?   
 Thanks for listening,
