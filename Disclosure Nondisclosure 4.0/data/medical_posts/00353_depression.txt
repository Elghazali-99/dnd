Hi everyone 
I've been on ADs for years and recently started seroxat (paroxetine) and I'm on 20mg now it's the 4th day and this is going on:
 Mood swings (but have period so could be cause as well as my cat who is ill at the moment so am v.worried)
Sweating but chills as well
Abdominal pains
 Most of all INSOMNIA. And I have to take diazepam to help but I don't want o get used to this stuff as I know it can be incredibly habit forming. It's not pleasurable but it usually does the job. Now it doesn't as well as before. 
When I run out of them, I'll be tempted to ask for more but I think that's not wise. But I need to sleep! I go swimming every day and walk loads, but this AD is provoking the insomnia.
 Will this get better, as my face is lookin zombie like with lack of sleep (not handy for the moods)
Anyone taking this have advice? The Zoloft I took before did nothing hence why I'm on this. And I've already had the relevant Stronger SNRIs before which worked well but were not physically good for my body so I had to swap to SSRIs. 
 I know it could be worse and there are bigger issues than mine out there so I won't go on and on, I just wana kno if anyone's on this drug and what can expected?
 Many thanks :)
