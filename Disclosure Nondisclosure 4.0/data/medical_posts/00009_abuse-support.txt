As a little girl my grandfather molested me until he was caught by my mother. He was a cop and so was my dad at the time...... Nothing ever happened it was swept under the carpet never talked about. No apologies from my parents no hugs of comfort. In my early 20's got involved with someone who told me " that was 20 years ago get over it" when I was having issues in the bedroom.  Years later he would brag to his friends how awesome i was in bed after my Ambien would take effect. After 19 years and 2 kids later I left after finding a tracking device in my car. I've been on my own for 9 months the verbal abuse still continues " you are a bad person" I've had a male friend I've known for 20 years one of my " best friends" come into my life made me feel whole until we slept together 1 time.... Haven't heard from him since. Yesterday a cousin who I haven't heard from was texting about how perfect and hot I was and the stuff he wanted to do to me. I haven't talked to the guy in years. Am I missing something? Is there something about me that attracts these stupid assholes? I trust not one word a single person says to me. I'm a wonderful person so why are these people always showing up? Idk
