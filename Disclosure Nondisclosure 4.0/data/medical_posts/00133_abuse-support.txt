I can't ever remember anything happening to me but as a child I showed all the symptoms, peeing afraid to be alone.  I remember being 4 and telling my mom i was too sick to attend church so i could hide behind the couch and masterbate.  I stuck things in my ears b/c it aroused me as a child(strange i know).  I played with my barbies in a sexual way.  I still to this day get a feeling of wanting to jump out of my skin, creeped out feeling on sundays or when i am pregnant.  I have been in therapy and she kind of alluded to my brother being the culprit.  I don't even know if I want to remember since if it did happen i am blocking it for a reason.  But i would like to be able to pin point as to why I am the way I am now, not wanting sex with my husband but wanting to strip for strangers. I have read about the whole repressed memory thing and don't know if it is true.  Is there anyone else out there who has felt this way.  Whenever I try to describe the way i feel on Sunday people think I am strange and I don't know if it is just me or a sign of being abused.
