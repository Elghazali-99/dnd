Back again, and with a few more questions :)
 My boyfriend and I recently took part in manual sex. Although he never had any pre-ejaculatory fluid on his hands, he never ejaculated, and I never touched my own vulva, I'm still very nervous. We took part in this act about 4 weeks ago. I took one pregnancy test 10 days after we had manual sex, and one 15 days after as well; both were negative. I had my period last week, and it was the same flow as always, and lasted for 7 days. I've read many of your articles, and it says that manual sex poses no risks of pregnancy, but honestly, I'm still very nervous. Some people say that you can be pregnant and still get your period; is this true? My abdominal area has been pulsating, and my round ligament seems to act as if it's being pulled; and I've read online that these are two common symptoms associated with pregnancy. I started birth control last Sunday, and I'm guessing this is what has been causing my nausea, breast tenderness, carsickness, fatigue, and painful bloating. My abdomen is tender to touch, and sometimes feels hard. I know this is probably all in my head, but I do need some reassuring advice. I'm not pregnant, correct?
