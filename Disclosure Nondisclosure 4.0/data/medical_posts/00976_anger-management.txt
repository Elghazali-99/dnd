Hi,
 My daughter has been extremley aggressive for the last 3 years... she steals lies and threatens to kill me if she could get away with it... she has a one year daughter that my husband and I support and take care except for at night after dinner and bath where my daughter then informs me she is the mother and to stay out of her business which consists of sitting on the couch texting instead of watching her baby.... she makes up stories about being sick or molested when she was a kid, which isnt true and when i call her out on it she changes her story.... she will throw fits when she doesnt get what she wants and packs the babies stuff and threatens to take her to her friends who is an unfit mother.... she has bitten me and hits me... her favorite name for me is stupid b.... and everyother swear word she can throw at me she does this in front of the baby who cries and shakes when I tell her to stop she tells me its her**** child...... I hate her to come home she makes me sick at my stomach with stress... everyone says kick her out.... I cant I have parents with health issues and they love the baby so much that they tell me they will die if I let her go or the baby willl die.... She knows I dont want her to move and all I ask is to pay her bills which she never does and gets taken to court over.... and be respectful.... I have too much to worry about... My Mom has Crest syndrome an auto-immune diesease, my Dad has been having mini-strokes my grandma had a massive stroke my son has grand -mal sezuires and my brother-in-law has cancer in his eye... Me I survived cancer and when I was going into surgery she posted on her facebook that her and her dad wished I die.... Please what is wrong with her????? Help!!!!!!!
