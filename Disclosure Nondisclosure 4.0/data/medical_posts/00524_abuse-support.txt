I just ended my one year abusive relationship with my boyfriend. I had always thought of myself as a caring, compassionate, and kind individual. However, i started to hit him back and lash out at him the way he would to me. He said whenever he hit me or yelled obscene things its because i egged him on and deserved it, but he got to know my triggers so well and made me lash out.  He was a recovering heroin and crack addict and i stayed behind him. However, he still drank excessively and was extremely moody. His mother and old doctor suspected borderline personality which made him a master manipulator. I moved out of my house and was at his beck and call. I barely saw friends. My life was work and trying to please him. For the six months i lived with him, i saw my mother probably three times. 
Our breakup was nasty, he demeaned me in front of my cousins boyfriend, calling me a fat **** (i'm 125 pounds and 5'5, not fat, i finally believe im not fat) so i packed stuff up and went to my cousins. My cousins boyfriend stayed, they drank two bottles of whiskey, and got a hooker. when i confronted him on it, he slapped me across the face, so i hit him. he punched me and yelled and bruised my face, ribs, and gave me a concussion. He said he wasnt thinking straight, he was drunk, and he was ashamed, but i am so done with the violence that kept escalting.
what i need to know is.. am i just as bad as him for hitting him ? for reacting when he wanted me to?
