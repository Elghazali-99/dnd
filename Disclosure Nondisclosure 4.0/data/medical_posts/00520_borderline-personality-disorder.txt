This is not a question I need answered. After reading these, I feel compelled to share. i suffered from bpd for years. It ruined my life, relationships, family, and almost lost my daughter to cps, or her daddy. I was so emotional, lost, defeted, angry, and alone. Once I accepted the bpd, I started a therapy called DBT. It saved my life. Dialectal Behavior Therapy created by Marsha Linihan. It taught me that my feelings were valid, but that I was in my emotional mind. I was taught to use my reasonable mind to find a middle ground. I go to a group therapy to have support and learn skills, and have an individual therapist to get more into detail with. You choose what target behavior you want to change, but don't talk about it in group, only to say you had a target behavior that week, our that there were none. This is because one persons last be the same as another and we don't want to trigger someone. That is talked about in individual therapy. If I do get into a tizzy and really need some help, I can call our text my therapist, and she will give me 3 skills to try so I can regulate my emotions. I am much more even, calm, confident, happy, and my life is so different from a year ago when I started. I graduate in december. It us a 6 month program that you repeat once, you'll find this helpful. You will look forward to going hate to leave never want to miss and crest some song friendships and a support system if those who understand. Good luck, I hope this helps. Feel free to add to what I said to help those who are lost and in need if help and encouragement.
