Im nearly 19 years old, I want to make an appointment with the doctor but cant because im to scared to go to the doctors and dont know why, i want help but i cant get on buses or travel for it, I was wondering where i can seek help and dont have to leave my house basically. I have anxiety and depression. Im constantly scared and so scared its unatural and i dont know what im scared of, i worry so much that i think one day it is going to kill me, if i had a conflict or argument with some one i would worry about it for weeks months and it will make me really down and upset, i would also hide in my room until everything clears up and feeel shaky and depressed, i find it hard to get out of bed atall unless there is money involved im sort of happy when i get money but seem to spend it on rubbish and other people, them when the moneys gone i feel down,if im in a rtoom with lots of people or out in town say, i get really shaky and feel asthough im going to wee myself so i put my hands down my pants to check that i havent thats one reason i dont go out, when im walking down the road i feel as though people in cars going past are laughing at me because i have weed myself but never have done before,so then i get paronoidi feel like people walking past me are laughing at me, also if i see two people whispering or talking slyly to eacvhother i feel as though they are saying nasty things about me or planning something, i feel asthough im really hard and put across a hard face but the truth is im scared of everything these days, im fed up of somewhat pretending im something im not but its just me now, i dont really show mental health problems its all in my head and personal thats why alot of people dont take it serious but my life is slowly falling apart and the honest truth is i think about heaven alot and hope that its real incase i ever go but i also get scared about suicide incase my mum kileed herself if i did it or it ruined everyones lifes thats all that stops me, the only time i feel better if when it is storming and raining heavy no matter what time it is i always put my coat on and go for a walk and get soaked i love the dark and rain maybe because no one can see me i dont know ? im scared because maybe one day i wont be even able to leave the house because thats how its getting, i know people are going to say go to a&e but its not an option as i cant sit in there and im scared of going incase they think im lieing or just send me home then ill feel worse because ill think theres nothing wrong with me im stupid but deep down i know that im not well atall , Thankyou all for reading and any help atall will be honestly much appreciated, as i have wrote on here before and the responses were not much of an help, Thanks
