About two weeks ago, I hit my upper/right thigh at work off of a hard edge. The bruise was large and almost black, but it's gradually faded, but now I have a hard lump a bit smaller than a toy marble. 
 My doctor said it's a hematoma (but if it grows in size or changes to come back in a month?), but I want testing done now. I've known people who have developed or found sarcomas after traumatic injuries. How do I go about being screened without seeming like a hypochondriac?
 Is it really just a hematoma, I don't want to hinge on a false guess and end up in the hospital months from now with a doctor "oh i guess it really wasn't a hematoma, hope you like chemo". (sorry for the bitter commentary, but I've been through enough problems with doctors saying something was what it wasn't, or wasn't what it was. It took me 6 months to finally convince doctors to give me an ultrasound to check my gallbladder.. This is after countless appointments, 5 visits to the ER during attacks that were dismissed as heart burn and food poisoning). 7 months after my initial complaint that I thought I  was having gallbladder attacks, I finally had it removed.)
 the reason I brought that story up, is because if this supposed "hematoma" isn't that, I don't really think waiting around, without doing anything about it, for months, is in my best interest. Potential cancer isn't like a gallbladder, it gets bad, FAST.
 I just want to know how I can do to make them take me seriously and get this stuff done now, yesterday would've been nice, but now.
