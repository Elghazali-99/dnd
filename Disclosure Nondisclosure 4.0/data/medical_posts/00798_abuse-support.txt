I'm a  60yr old female who has never been on my own. I'm dependant on my husband for my support and most importantly health insurance. We have 2 businesses that are not finacially stable and I do the bookwork for both companies. I'm intelligent but not proficent in anything (typing, bookkeeping or computers) With the job market and housing sales down I don't know where to get help to support myself. I've got fibromyalgia, osteo-arthritis and hypo-calcemia. My husbands abuse (verbal) is getting worse all the time because I' can't do as much as I use to. Very depressed, have no social life or close friends anymore due to fatigue and not really feeling like leaving the house. My son moved 2000 miles away to work because here in Mich are business is so up and down couldn't support his family.Daughter is in her own world and has her own issues. My husband dosen't know anything about the paperwork or bookkeeping involved in our business always has someone else take care of everything which has cost alot of money over the yrs. due to getting screwed over by people. Have assets but can't sell. I'm deparate to leave.  Are there places that would help me in these circumstances?? Please any help would be appreciated.
 Thanks, Linda
