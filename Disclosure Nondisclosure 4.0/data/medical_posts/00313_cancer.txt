So I am almost sixteen years old and I have been been going through a few things. I don't think it's cancer because it's been going on for a few years on and off. A few years ago, I went on a really strict diet and really quickly into it I started getting really dizzy and I wouldn't be able to see for a few seconds. The longer I was on the diet, the more often it happened and the longer my lack of being able to see came along. My mom took me off the diet when I lost my balance one time and since then it's happened on and off.
 Along with this, I've had a chronic headache for years. Usually I have to take Ibuprofen within an hour after any sort of pain going on in my head before it gets so bad I fall to me knees and I don't want to walk. This has been pretty consistent for about a year.
 Now, this may be completely disconnected to this but I might as well add it encase it's important. I also get hurt insanely easily. Like, I'm clumsy, yeah. But if I fall and get a scrape, it'll become a scar no matter how bad it is.
 This all might be nothing but the dizziness if really worrying me because it came back a few times today and I was just wondering what you guys might be able to tell me.... Thank you for reading this, and I hope you can get back to me as soon as possible.
