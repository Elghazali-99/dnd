Its so hard. I am told by my husband that being stepmom to his 7 year old ‘is what I make it’ in other words, if I want to consider him my own… then he is my own. That’s all great until husband disagrees with me… for example,  I wanted to punish the kid over breaking an electronic… a 5 minute time out is what I was asking for. Husband wasn’t in agreement, because it was an ‘accident’. So he kindly reminded me that he does in fact have the final say. WTF. He wants me to act like the ‘bio parent’ as long as it his way and he is in agreement. Husband can make mistakes, get mad or yell at the kid….I do that, and it causes a fight. Then he’s worried about when we have kids. I cant take it. He was a single parent for a few years with 100% custody… its been 50/50 now for a year. He’s not used to consulting anyone but for god sakes I am in a no win situation. Everything I do it wrong. Everything I don’t do is wrong.  I don’t get any reward from that kid. No hugs, no ‘I miss you’ nothing. I give and give and then I cant get mad or frustrated when he breaks something of mine.
