I have been with my soon to be ex-husband for 7 years and we have two 7 year old girls. We have been on and off, living together and not for the entire 7 years but we were always still "togehter" He was physically and mentaly abusive and my daughters saw most of it. I did put up with it for 7 years and have recently desided to get a divorse. I met an awsome man that I believe truly cherishes my daughters and I.....here is where I am stuck.....My husband claims to be miserable and said he understands what he did was wrong and he wants to prove that he can be a better husband and most of all a better dad. He has begged me for 10 mos now to come back. He said all that he needs is one chanceand that if I am not happy I can leave. He offered to go to marrige counceling and start slow. I am very happy in my new relationship and it is a very healthy one. Do I need to give my husband a chance to be better for my daughters? They have never been attached to him nor do they ask to see him. I feel guilty that I wont.
