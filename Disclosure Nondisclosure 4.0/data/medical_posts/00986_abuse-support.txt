I have had a very good friend so I thought she was for many years we are now in our mid 30's we are both married and have children.  Our husbands in time became like best friends so we did lot's of visiting and went out as couples all the time at times it was every single week end.  Just a few weeks at one of these visits the couple was at our home we all had drinks and were a little dizzy but not much my friend and her children stayed at my house she slept at the couch in our living room her children on the floor.  I went to my room thinking the kids and my friend will be okay after a few minutes i realized my husband was not in the room yet so I walked out to see if maybe he had fallen asleep in the kids room or just to see where he was, as I walked into the living (it was a little lite) I noticed he got from being on top of her, all I said was "I saw that" I froze I did not know what else to do or say I stormed back to my bedroom sat on the bed and waited for him to come in like 10 minutes passed by and nothing so I went back out and he was on top of her again kissing her!!! We have talked he wants a 2nd chance!!!! I am having a very hard time I don't know what to do I picture the scene all the time I can't even walk into my living room! The one that was my friend chose to say she doesn't remember a thing and if I don't want to talk to her anymore she understood.  We have 3 little boy's I thought I had the perfect husband and the perfect marriage and now I want out but then I don't what should I do ?
