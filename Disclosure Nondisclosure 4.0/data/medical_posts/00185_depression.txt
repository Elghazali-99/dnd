Hi everyone----So I began taking generic Wellbutrin 150 xl  trend by the manufacture Par Pharm nine days ago. Until yesterday I had zero symptoms or side effects from the new med. I am a 30-year-old overall healthy female who was prescribed this medication for migraines, occipital neuralgia, and moderate depression due to the prior mentioned. Wow, do headaches and migraines hurt, ugh...no wonder I was mild/moderately depressed. The good news is since since starting Wellbutrin (generic), I have not had one single headache or migraine what a relief! Bad news: I woke up from my sleep last night with a burning sensation down my right thigh. On my shift today at work not only did the burning sensation of my right side continue my, kneecap became swollen and so did my ankle. My fingers also on my right hand are sore and weak. It is now 24-hours later and my right leg pain has not subsided. I work in the medical field w/ patients all day & i could not even bend, squat, or move a patient. I came home to a very swollen ankle, calf, and kneecap. My Doctor advised me to stop the Rx cold turkey after 9-days but this is the first time in 3-years I have lived without a headache/migraine/and the depression from that. Has this happened to anyone else on generic Wellbutrin? Has anyone had success switching to the brand name and the symptoms going away after that? Should I ride out the pain or is this a serious side effect? Will I be okay to discontinue Rx after 9-days? Any advice, suggestions, recommendations, and personal experiences would be so appreciated. I can quite nervous over this unforeseen side-effect that I have encountered and honestly, a bit bummed about what is happening. Thanks all! Cheers to good health for all!
