Okay so it's been two days since it happen... That guy that I was dating for 13 months left me march 9 th and he left me for my friends and needless to say she is no longer my friend and on April fools day he sent me a text message saying...Hey I have something I really wanna tell you... I miss you and really want us to be together and everything back to how it's support to be or at least was... When I was with you I felt like my life was perfect, like I had everything I ever wanted and needed... Now that we are not together I feel empty and like I'm missing something and I realized that it was you... When we split up I lost a part of me, a part of my heart and I really wish i waswith you and that i could call you mine and that it was me standing next to you holding your hand knowing that you will be there beside me whenever I need you... Then I was so confused and lost and I didn't know what to say and then after like five minutes he said... Haha april fools you thought you know i dont want you back and I'm happy with my new gf and I don't need you any more.... NOw I don't know what to do I can't stop thinking about how that made me feel and I don't know what to do I can't stop crying it's like this no one knows how I feel about this not even my best friend I can't talk to her because all she ever says is I never liked him anyways you don't need him I don't want to hear about it any more so I feel so alone about all of this it's really depressing and all so I need someone's help... Please D:
