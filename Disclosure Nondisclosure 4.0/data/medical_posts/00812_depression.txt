Hello. i am 21... I had a bf who cheated me but i am so over it... We were together since five years..We were very serious.. Bt never mind... So my parents found out about us a month after we broke up... I am an architecture student, finished my second year.. My parents cancelled my thied year admission... Read all my private conversations hacking all my email id , fb account, they told every distant relative .. I am now not allowed to go out anywhere, use phone or internet. I am not allowed to speak to my friends and they are very abusing me concerning with the contents of the messages with my bf. Thwy make me feel inferior every second of the day... Its like em in jail.. And the most important thing is they are going to cancel my admission in architecture permanently and marry me off.. But they think that even a watchman will not marry me cz of my character.. My books are my everything.. I was among toppers in studies.. I cnt accept an illetrate life being so good at it... Its been an year.. And admissions are on head... But i cant get in... It makes me sick thinking about it every second..i really don't wantnto give it up... Ive tried talkinh to them but they dont listen... Ive never been to a restaurant, never gone to a theatre, never partied, never gone out qith friends.. And now this.... Ita unbearable...i want to commit suicide... Bt i think i am so much more than that.... I need a solution to this...
