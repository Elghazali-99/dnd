I have been married two years.  We've been together four years.  At the beginning of our relationship she was very accepting of my flaws. Now she can't stand me.  We have a hard time agreeing on anything.  She attacks me with words, without taking a breath she can accuse me of lying, being a bad husband, being a jerk and a complete failure at life.  Every time I open my mouth to talk she cuts into her speach again. I hardly get a word in, so I get frustrated and angry.  Most of the time I just shut down and let her talk herself out.  She just won't sit there and listen without opening her mouth. So I start YELLING.  Then she sais I'm nuts.  I need theropy.  I'm the abusive one?  
Yesterday I was about to pull out of the driveway and she was too. From her car she tells me to go get the trash barrels. So I shut my engine off and start walking up the driveway.  While she's pulling away she smiles and makes a "cracking whip noise".  I bite my lip and keep walking.
My wife has a way of always finding something for me to do at inopertune times.  She likes to see me drop everything I'm doing and do what she wants me to do.  She feels I suck at domestic life.  She sais I'd rather be leading a single life. I tell her over and over that I want to be with her.  In arguements she compares me to her exhusband. I know I'm not good around the house.  She knew it when she married me.  I try.
Who's being abused here?
