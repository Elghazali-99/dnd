It's been a short while since I've posted a question, sorry for the burden, but I'm not sure what to do anymore. I got the help! I have been working with my counselor to straighten out and fix my PTSD and self esteem issues. They have gotten better and I don't struggle as bad! It's a huge load off. I also haven't self harmed in almost a month. Everything has been looking up but through these past 2 weeks alone all of the sudden school and daily things are taking the place of the problems I got rid of. I'm somehow depressed again, and now that I got rid of my cutting problem a solution has been popping in my head more. It's not a new thought, but it keeps coming to me, it sounds better and better every time. Suicide, the only thing that has stopped me from acting on this thought is my family. They would have to spend money on a funeral and I heard they were pretty expensive. But- that's not really the point of this post. What is the point is what I should do. My counselor and I have went over all problems except this, because I know that they will tell this problem to my parents. I'm sorry for this meaningless post, I know it seems like a dumb question. I'm a pansy that can't gather up the guts to just get over whatever this is. But I don't know what to do. I took the advice of telling her everything I just had to leave that one part out, I can't bring myself to tell. So...please if you can, what should I do?
