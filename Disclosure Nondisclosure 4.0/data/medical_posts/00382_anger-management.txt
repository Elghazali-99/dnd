I've been married for 21yrs. My husband didn't show me that he had anger issues until we were married for about 6 months. It began at first with putting Visine eye drops in my eyes where he got so upset with me that he threw the medicine at the closet door. Later we began yelling at me for various things, even being physical with me. I was raised with abuse and could not recognize my husband's abuse. I always thought I was the problem and he was right. Now, at 40yrs old I don't believe in his views.
 I am tired of his anger towards our children. When he gets angry, he gets so loud, so degrading and he physically bullies them acting like he is going to do something to them. He never asks the kids what is wrong, or what happened. He just acts like he knows and he immediately punishes them.
 With me, he is not as harsh yet that doesn't mean he is better. If I say no to sex, he will insult me. He frequently yells at me in front of the children. He expects his rules to be done to the letter of the law at times, and when I fail, I get yelled at. 
 He snoops in my van for wrappers to foods that I bought so that he can make a mess in my van showing me that he knows that I ate something wrong. He checks my internet usage for the amount of time I spend on it at night when he is at work. He hates all my friends and doesn't like me going out much. He rarely praises anyone in his family.
 Recently I stood up to him and told him that I won't take this anymore. I tried to explain how I see his actions but he won't allow me to finish my thoughts without interrupting me, yelling at me and trying to single out small points to make it my fault. He doesn't want to hear his faults at all and I told him that I won't continue to talk to him unless he listens to me. 
 He is now punishing me by not sleeping with me and refusing to talk to me.
 I don't know what to do.
