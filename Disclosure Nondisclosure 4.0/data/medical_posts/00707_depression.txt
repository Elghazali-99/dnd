How long does this withdrawal take?  Never again will I go on these prescription drugs. I have read what all of you have written, so many people, so much the same affects.  What is worse, depression or Meds, where is the help in this? I feel worse with this withdrawal then sometimes with my depression. I tried what all of you have written about the B-complex, Omega 3's, drinking water, very slow process, but I keep doing it, hoping for relief. My own job I could lose, due to my own problems dealing with people. This has nothing to do with my withdrawal, but it doesn't help the 
stress I have trying to hold myself together as I go to work.  I have looked into natural ways to help depression, still thinking yes, no??  The mind is strong and we could teach it to help ourselves through anything. In today's world with stress and worries we just need the patience and practice.  I talk a good game right?  Bottom line is things will get better, they always do, and you wonder how we made it. I wish us all well, take care.
