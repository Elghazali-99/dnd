I have been dating
A boy for about 2 years now I'm
ld and we have already been through so so much together he literally
Is such a genuine humble amazing
Person but  everything just hit him. I was dating a guy when we first met, but had ended things with that guy to see my
Now present boyfriend he didn't know that until my snitch of a best friend had told him and then everything from
There has gone down hill due to me having these on edge feelings I started to talk to
This other guy as a friend for advice because I literally had no one not even my mum because she was so verbally aggressively I stopped talking to him
Once I found out all he wanted was to have sex so I told him
Not interested and didn't make my
Case any better, as a result of him
Finding out there were reactions that has now got me
Mentally and emotionally
Abused I had to delete over 3/4 of the boys on my
Friends list on fb I got rid of people in my life and definitely made a change to make this relationship work (because it was so so amazing to start with)  with him yet I can't let him
Go  he has said horrible things to
Me let alone getting others involved he has made me cry for about everyday for 3 months leading to me getting glandular fever for 3 weeks due to high levels of stress, fatigue and emotional draining I had become
Depressed and started cutting I stopped with the help
Of
Counsellor and a change in a group of
Friends 
 Things have become better  but now he thinks he's scared and can't trust me 
He won't let me go out
With friends but when he says "I don't mind do what you want" I know he is mad and then tells me like next few days I can't believe you went out etx and tries to break it off with me :( I don't know what to
Do I'm just so
Attached and people think I'm
Crazy 
It's like some
Cycle I can't get out off 
Just so much has happened and that isn't even half
