Hello I have a penny sized lump on the top of my thigh. I went to my GP and I was really unsatisfied with the examination. She sent me for a ultrasound and the results determined there was not blood clot. I complained of frequent swelling of lymph nodes since last September in my neck, which come and go. I told her my concerns of it possibly being a lymph node but she gave me no response. Also I have no follow up, the nurse told me it was not a blood clot and sent me on my way (i.e. no follow up plans). I am concerned and wonder why I have lymph nodes popping up in my neck and leg that come and go. I tested neg for Mono and recently Hiv. 
 Any help and/or suggestions? can it be something else? if it is a lymph node am I just more susceptible to swelling when I come in contact with everyday virus/bacteria 
  Also it does not hurt when I exercise legs or run so I doubt it's a strain.. I've noticed it for a little less than 2 weeks now 
 -Thank you in advance
 also it is not harder and painless
