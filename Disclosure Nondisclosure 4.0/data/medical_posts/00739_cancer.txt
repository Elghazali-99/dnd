Hi Im a 17 year old female, I am overweight. and im very scared that I might have a brain tumor, the left side of my head sometimes hurts, like it's not a headache type of pain but it's more like a dull pressure type of headache, now it's usually not worse in the morning, but usually worse during the day/night, and I had this head ache for around a week 3 weeks ago, and now I have it again, it's only on my left side, usually when I have a headache I can my massage my eyebrows or temples and it will go away, but this dull pain just stays, also my left arm feels weaker? I've tried picking things up and it picks up just like the right arm, but it feels funny? my left eyes eye lid kept twitching around two days ago and wouldnt stop, also my left eye seems to be getting worse and worse vision, but my contacts are old, and if I take them out and wear glasses vision is the same and my headache goes away a little. also sometimes I forget what I need to say, sometimes food doesn't have taste? it's weird. now My mom is an RN and she says that im just freaking out. but I feel like I can actually feel the tumor? my left eye is also very dry. I do have a high level of anxiety, i Google about this at least 10 times a day. thank you. also when I stretch I get this sharp pain in my head. also yesterday I was almost asleep and my whole body like twitched...?
