I am a 22 year old female. I have been clean off of drugs for a year. This being said, I have became more health conscious but im starting to feel like it has gone too far.
 My first problem is that eating is difficult and at this point I feel like I have developed anorexia. But it is not due to my self image, I have always been skinny, I know im not fat and I never have felt fat, if anything..I wish I could gain weight. When I eat too much, I get very tired. If I eat breakfast in the morning, I feel so sluggish the entire day, so I always skip breakfast. By the time I actually eat something, I have to be very careful HOW much I eat. Usually I can only stomach half a bagel, A full bagel at one sitting will make me feel sluggish and I start to feel unmotivated and unproductive and it makes it difficult to get threw the day. By the time I am done my daily work and activities and I am ready to eat, it is too late at night for me to order food or im simply so lazy I just dont care to eat, or I eat something small like ramen noodles so im not starving. Most of the time, that is the brunt of what I eat each day. Eating is SO MUCH FUN, i LOVE EATING, but I hate the way i feel after so I try to control how much I eat. I also start to become paranoid that I have heart problems and every time I eat something I am afraid I will start to feel pain in my heart or somewhere else in my body. Im thinking this is anorexia induced by anxiety? Is that possible? What could I start to do about this? Anyone else share a similar experience? 
 My period is late and I am starting to believe it could be from this problem. I have also recently had a copper IUD removed that has caused me MANY HEALTH PROBLEMS and i believe that could have contributed to my health anxiety as well
 Any similar stories would be appreciated!!!?
