I Googled "Coming off Lexapro" and came across dozens of health-related websites (similar to this) where I read report after report after report of absolutely HORRIBLE withdrawl symptoms of people coming off Lexapro.
 Has anyone come off Lexapro with GOOD results?
 One thing in common with most of these is that they would say they would go from, say 10 mg. to 5 mg for just a week and then off of it completely.  A week at 5mg. doesn't seem nearly long enough to me.  
 I am thinking maybe going from my current 10mg to 5 mg for several MONTHS and then maybe 2.5mg (if it goes that low) for several more MONTHS may be a better way to come off Lexapro.
 After reading these horror stories, I also think that I should maybe start up again with the psychologist I had visited at the beginning when my general practioner first prescribed Lexapro.  At least then I would have a back-up already in place to help me.  I would like to try coming off of it in a few months but dread the return of symptoms and ESPECIALLY the withdrawl symptoms mentioned by others - like their "brain restarting or rebooting every 5 minutes" or their "brain being turned into a sponge being squeezed every 10 minutes" or "getting an electric shock to my brain" - YIKES!
 Lexapro has helped me a LOT over the last several months and has been symptom-free.  But I am past what was causing me to be depressed.  (Unless maybe my brain is just naturally lacking in serotonin or something.)
 So please - if ANYONE out there has had good results from coming off Lexapro, PLEASE let me know!!!   And also let me know what method you followed.
 Thanks!
