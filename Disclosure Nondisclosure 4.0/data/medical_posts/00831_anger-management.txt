Hello, 
I'm 21 years old, female. 
I think I have some anger issues, where I take my anger out on anything near me. 
I have previously been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety. 
I was on medication but I saw no results and stopped taking it. 
I hate being on medication so I want natural ways of controlling these things, 
Sometimes I just wake up and anything makes me angry, 
I feel I wake up with a ball of rage inside me and I try to keep it inside nut the more I do so the more it seems to get worse when I boil over, 
I get really angry to the point where I want to hurt others who are causing me to burst. 
And I have been lucky to not take my anger out on those who I love. 
I may shout but its nothing physical, although I do thing of physical ways to take my anger out on them. 
Its just making me upset and I feel like I want to cry because Its like I have soo many things wrong with me, 
I just don't know what to do anymore, I don't want to get too angry one day and physical hurt someone I love. 
Is there any natural ways to control it or make myself not think of bad thoughts.
