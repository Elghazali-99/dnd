well i was taking seroquel and another medicine. Doctor was forcing me to take another medicine which made me reactions. but seroquel has too much helped me from the beginning. I was like a disable without seroquel in the past. In past 300 mg of seroquel was not enough for me, i was disable by 300 mg. But now with 100 mg seroquel also i am capable except some little problems. I thank to seroquel a lot. But same time doctor forced me to take another that made me reactions. In the past aslo when doctor try to give another medicine that  time huge reaction happened. But i left another medicine some days before and my body moved automatically at night. then i take it back. but today i re tried the same again. symptones are similar. Before i go to work i took bath, make refresh and got all energy back. but i was little more than fast. i was given that medicione which makes me slow, sleepy, lazy, less power that i have no idea why. after i leaving it i got the power back. so i left it. But seroquel i should take . seroquel is like a god for me, but doctor says leave seroquel. thats not good for u. I am not against doctor too. THE NEW MEDICINE HAS HELPED ME TOO. BUT IT TOTALY DOESNT FIT FOR ME. IF MY BODY DONT MOVE AUTOMATICALLY I WILL LEAVE ANOTHER MEDICINE AND KEEP TAKING SEROQUEL 100 MG. AND SERQUEL I SHOULD TAKE FOR LITTLE LONG PERIOD 100 MG THEN I WILL LEAVE IT TOO BUT I CANT LIVE TAKING SUCH A EXPENSIVE MEDICINE. iTS IMPOSSIBLE. iF  i go to my country all the medicine will be automatically left. and if i have gone to my country some years before i will be in a wheelchair in my country. There i didnot find medicine. This year except some little problem atleast i wont be disable without medicine and we shouldnt leave medicine at once. Does mental people never get rid of medicine?
