Hi, everyone. I'm sorry this is long, but I need to ask a serious question. 
 My little sister Shannon has been having issues her whole life. She's 11 right now, very sweet little girl, with some developemental problems. Right now, doctors say she has EBD, OCD, and GAD. My mom is very in to the medical community (there's a lot of reasons to be between my sister and myself) and because of Shannon, very in to the mental health community. She's thought for a while Shannon's diagnosis doesn't seem quite right. Now, the doc wants Shannon to see a psychologist. Here's what's going on:
 For a while, my mom thought Shannon might have a high-functioning ASD, but the doc said she doesn't quite fit for that diagnosis. She seems normal at times, but something has been "off" with her for the past year, so my mom and I have been doing more research. For a whie, she was doing really, really good. Then, she started going backwards. Shannon's symptoms are listed below:
 - Born a micopreme, only about 4 lbs. She's been very small ever since and can't gain weight. She's also short and has a dairy allergy.
 - Muttering under her breath, like she's talking to someone. When you bring it up, she gets very agitated. A few times, I've caught her in her room having full conversations. She'll talk aloud, then mutter what the response would be, when nobody it there...
 - Wringing her hands and playing with her fingers
 - Dwelling on the past. If a kid said something to her three years ago, she'll bring it back up and rant endlessly about how it made her feel. She'll talk in circles about these things and she'll find ways to point out how the person it out to get her. 
 - A common saying for her now is "the whole world hates me!" She'll walk around saying, "No one gets it", "Why did that person look at me?", "They're staring/laughing" or "They're going to stare/laugh at me". None of these things actually happen. This makes it hard to go out because she'll bring up a reason why she wouldn't want to be there. The other day, we wanted to go to Wal-Mart and she didn't. When my mom asked her why, she got angry and said, "A while ago we were at Wal-Mart and this guy stared at me. He looked at me like, 'What's your problem?' and I didn't like it!" What really happened that day was she was dancing around and the guy pushing carts stood there waiting for her to move. That happened when she was in 1st grade. 
 - Very easily agitated. Like, you look at her wrong and she goes off the handle. 
 - Can't stand still. She's constantly changing how her feet are, her hands, or she'll dance in place while humming something. 
 - She holds grudges FOREVER. I think it might have to do with her dwelling on the past. 
 - "Rollercoaster" moods. One second, she's totally happy and normal, and the next she's all over the place, talking about how someone did something to her (usually from a long time ago) that made her angry.
 - She'll get so anxious it makes her sick. She'll just work herself up until her body physically can't take it anymore.
 On a "normal" day, Shannon will be a happy-go-lucky person. But on a "bad day", she'll throw screaming fits and be impossible to handle. We got called up to school just last week because a kid brought in cupcakes that had butter in the frosting. Shan obviously can't eat that, so she threw a fit, saying the kid did it on purpose because he hates her. The kid doesn't even know her name because he's new to the school and been there only a few months. While the prinicipal is nice and patient, a few teachers and counslers in the past have suggested us homeschooling her, or "part-timing" where she only goes to school for half the day and we do the other half. 
 Shannon does have a twin, Kelly, who is totally normal apart from a bit of an attitude, but it's nothing that gets in the way of social interactions. Shannon does have some trouble making friends because of what's listed above, and she thinks people make fun of her, so that doesn't help. If she's having a "bad day", then people don't want to be in the same room with her who don't know her. 
 I'm bringing all this up because my family does have a history of mental illness. Depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, and various other mental ailments. My moms uncle was actually locked in an asylum because his family couldn't handle him (but that was years and years ago). 
 My parents are at their wits end with her. My mom has had to quite work and do daycare out of the home so that she can be ready if we had to get called in to handle a melt-down at school. I've had to reconsider where I'm going to school when I graduate from high school next year so I can stay home and be there for Shannon. She's going in to middle school, and i'm so, so worried her anxiety will get worse, along with the paranoia. We all love her, of course, but it hurts to know that none of the treatments they've tried are working. My mom is worried about what the psychologist will find when Shannon goes to talk to him, and so she wanted me to post here so we coudl kind of get an idea of what we're in for. 
 I appriciate any ideas that anyone has. We just want to help Shannon. She's said before she feels so bad because she knows she's hurting us. What 11 year old has to think about things like that? I feel awful that we can't help her. 
 Thank you so, so much for your patience and answers!
