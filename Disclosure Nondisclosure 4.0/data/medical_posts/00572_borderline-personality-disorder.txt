I have problems with short term memory. I have been this way for at least ten years I no, but I just realized it was a real problem about 3 yrs ago and it has gotten worst.  I can't remember from one minute to the next. I have a had time moving further with anything, because I don't remember things so I don't have anything to build on. I want to say this I was molested when I was a child, I sometimes feel like I block things out with out realizing it, I did it as a child to be able to cope with the things that was being done to me. Now I am 45 yrs old and I am steel doing, I don't do it intentionally I don't know how to cut it off, it's almost like I erase things as I go. It may sound strange, but that is the only way that I know how to describe it. I feel in some way it has affected my learning ability, or may its still due to me not being able to remember what I just learned. I have several degrees, I learn but I have a hard time applying what I learn because I just can't remember. Please help me if there is any Doctor out there that will help me to see what is going on in my brain, it is very frustrating and it has affected my whole life. I know that God has so much more in life for me to do than for me to be trapped in my mind of forgetfulness. I love to read and to read the Bible, sometime I just say to myself whats the use, you are not going to remember anything anyway. And I don't. I am so tired of feeling this way. Please help me
