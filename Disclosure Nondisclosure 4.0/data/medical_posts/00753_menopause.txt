Im 45 yrs old & was diagnosed peri-menopause 2 yrs ago at the time I was have palpitation and hot flushes .i was prescribed HRT but decided I would go down the alternative route & took Maca daily and this kept all my symptoms at bay. Over 3 months ago I started getting pains in both my arms my gp took bloods but I was only mildly lacking in vit D and questioned it could be fibromalagia. I then started getting mild flu like symptoms,palpitations,would shake all over as thou I could not regulate my blood sugars.Nausea & loss of appetite , I also have heavy shakey legs and just did not no what to do with myself my GP thinks I have had a virus further bloods are negative .I had my period and for 5 days I felt normal but when my periods stopped the horrible shakey leg thing and nausea has come back ? Im due o return to work this week & not sure if Im up to it .I had my fsh taken at my sexual health clinic but says I have to wait a full cycle before they will consider HRT they are unable to give me my results. Im desperate now my legs are driving me insane the only time i have relief is to keep going for walks I usualy exercise 4 times a week. Im a staff nurse in a busy critical care unit I need to get back to work but cant see this happening Im living of ibrufen & Antiemetic's nothing is helping Are these symptoms menopause or viral
