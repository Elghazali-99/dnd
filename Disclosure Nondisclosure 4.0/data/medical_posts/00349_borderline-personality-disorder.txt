I'm up and down in my beliefs with this Disorder.  1 Minuite I think it's all a load of rubbish, on that track of thought the illness has been made up so proffessionals can throw 'akward' people in a box.  I do have a rather more upsetting think when I suddenly realise that I could 'really' have this illness.  Often m y behaviour has exhausted others and rather than blame it on my unique, nutty but laughable personality-I'm just 'sick in the head' with a mental health disorder called 'Borderline Personality Disorder'.  My partner knows a bit about it now, even my knowledge of it now makes it hard to comfortably justify my 'unstable' ways as I laugh and say 'I'd just be so boring if I behaved 'normally'.  I also say to my partner that he wouldn't have me any other way.  I've recently badly self-harmed and am struggling more and more to get through each day.  My partner has spent time away from me because of the strains.  I feel so guilty- I'm draining the life out of the poor man.  We have been together for 14 years.  Please 'elp me.  I'm scared.  Beanie
