My husband has a big anger problem, but he won't realize it. He get's mad at me all the time, about everything I do. Everything I do or the way I think or see things is wrong. He wants me to be like him, think like him. 
When we talk about him fliping out again, he get's mad again and tells me that I AM THE REASON he get's mad. 
I try to avoid him or not to listen but he get's really personal sometimes and says things, that he knows hurt me like, about my childhood. When I get emotional or cry, he gets even more mad.  My oldest son, his step-son (my son knows my husband since he is a baby. The only dad he knows is my husband)  well, I always knew that my husband loved him like his own son . But since we both had 2 more babies I feel like me and my oldest son are nothing but a bug-a-boo to him. My oldest son is a good kid but my husband always finds things to criticize him. He tells me "you and your son are so a like"  "I think totally different then you both"...   I am from a different country and my husband knows that I have nowhere to go. That's the power he has over me. He said that, if we get a divorse he will make sure that my two youngest will stay with him. I'm a stay-at-hm mom so I have no money for a good lawyer.
 My husband had a rough childhood though, his mother was being physically abused by his father. His mother ran away with the kids to a shelter, then got a divorce.  Well, my husband is also telling me not to act like he's beating me. I don't know what to do, I want him to get help but he will not listen to me. How can I make him understand that he is destroying our family?
