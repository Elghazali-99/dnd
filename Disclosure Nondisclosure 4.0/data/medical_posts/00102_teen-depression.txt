I cut, not very deep, just enough to see the blood come to the surface and watch a few drips of blood run down my arm.  It comforts me, make me not feel completely numb and helps me express my emotions.  I can feel external pain and it distracts me and helps me express what I feel inside.  I don't wan't to stop cutting but I know that I need to.  I have started to see a psychiatrist to help me with my depression and she has asked me if I self-harm or think about suicide, I always say no.  But I do self-harm and I sometimes do want to terminate my life.  I don't have the courage to talk to her about this because I am scared what measures she will take.  I already see her twice a week and am starting a support group.  She also made a side comment about monitoring me even more closely if I did self-harm or have suicidal thoughts.  Do you have any tips for me about how to stop cutting and have the motivation to do so?  I really don't know how I would cope without self-harm...
