For many years I have never really felt happy for long periods of time, I am able to laugh and have fun with friends (I have only had 3)  time to time but when it is time to be alone, I feel crazy... I think of all the things that make me hate being in this world... like, my low-self esteem, my past and I even think of the future... I either see blank or just all the bad things that could go wrong. I constantly worry about everything, little things and big things. I think of how I would rather be dead than have to deal with it... but another part of me feels like I should try to see the good things I have... and I do have good things. But, I feel so worthless... I really do not think I have much to keep me here... besides the guilt of bringing pain to my loved ones... I have tried seeking help before and quickly gave up when I realized I cannot afford it... why would I pay so much to save myself when I do not even care... I do not know what I feel... I always thought it was just a phase or maybe I have been overreacting... I hurt myself a lot... sometimes I feel like i enjoy feeling worthless...I cannot even remember being truly happy... not even when I think of my childhood... I remember being lonely and hating everyone... I do not know what to do... the pain almost feels physical... like my chest is heavy all the time... I always want to cry but I am so use to it that I just feel blank... I am not sure what I am doing on this page.. maybe hoping I can fix something but I do not know... I want to stop caring... I am too scared to die but I want to so bad... Can I ever shake off this feeling... Sorry my question is so disorganized....
