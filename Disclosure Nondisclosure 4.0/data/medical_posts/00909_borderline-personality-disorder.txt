I was diagnosed with bpd in my teens, but as the years went by I seemed to tuck it far into my recognition. I am now in my early 30s and in therapy I mentioned that I was looking for a group to start with, she recommended DBT. She said that it is primarily for people diagnosed with bpd, but she felt it would help me. That sparked something in my memory that I was already diagnosed with it, so I began doing a lot of research on this...Wow, I AM!!! For the past 15 years or so, I just thought I was miserable person. Now, it all makes sense. OK...so my question to all of you is...Now that I can admit that I am borderline, my husband uses it against me. If I approach him on something that bothers me, he will say its your borderline making you feel this way, etc... Maybe he is right on some things,but not everything!!! He has a passcode on his cell that I don't know and he won't tell me it. He says that it is his personal space and he doesn't feel I have the right any longer to look through his stuff ( I always had a snooping problem because I don't trust). So last night I stated that I feel very uneasy regarding that, he got furious and said and turned it back on me. What can I do about this? My borderline only seems to affect me and my husband, no one else sees it! They all feel he's the bad guy, he's controlling, jelous, mean at times, and he feels he's ALWAYS right! Help me in this!!!
