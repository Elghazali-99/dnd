I am 21 years old, i have been battleing anxiety and panic attacks since about 14 i used to be on antidepressants for it but back then never really had a ride to mental help to talk to someone so i just stopped taking me meds and everything well i have a child now and she is almost a year old my whole pregnancy i only got one panic attack and it didnt last to long but since ive had her i have them all the time and they just keep getting worse and worse so i will drink to self medicate myself but i never drink enough to where i cant take care of my daughter and when i put her to bed i drink myself to sleep ive been to mental health again not to long ago to be evaluated and i told them about my anxiety and that i drink everyday to deal with it they just told me to stop drinking and do breatheing exercises but that does help i cant stop drinking or its worse and i am just so hopeless right now i have my boyfriend that helps me take care of our daughter but i cant do this anymore i used to have a bad cutting problem but i stopped for my daughter and right now i feel like that is my only way to get help and for someone to take me seriously my panic attacks are slowly killing me i cant take it like i just want to call an er right now and tell them i need help but i dont want my daughter to get taken away from me i dont want to lose her what should i do????
