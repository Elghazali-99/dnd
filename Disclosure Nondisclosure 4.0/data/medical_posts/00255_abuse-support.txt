I kinda have been looking online to find out if i can find any signs of what i'm searching for..But i honestly can't.. I'm a single mother of a 2 year old.. She goes to her dads house every other weekend.. her dad was molested by his brother for 5 years.. The brother is  sex offender and still goes around the family.. I don't know how often he goes over there.
 My question is ..About a month ago. She left here fine with taking baths..Actually loved them.. She came home on a sunday and couldnt even be around water with out sceaming It took me a moth for her to like water again with out the pannic attack she was having when i tried to give her a bath..I asked him time over time.. He said he didnt know what happend.. Well every other weekend she comes back with a diaper rash..
 This last time she has come home she is acting really strange..I try to change her and she fights with me about getting changed .. She says she hurts..And when she sits in water and screams she's in pain.. Her butt crack is still very red.. I'm not sure into what to do..
 I was wonderin if you could give me any signs on a 2 year year old being molested??
