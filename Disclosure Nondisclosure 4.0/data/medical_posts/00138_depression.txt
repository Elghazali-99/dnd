This all started when I was married.  I used to wake up in the morning and feel really angry at my wife because
we had a lot of arguments.  I guess somehow I ended up cracking one night after a heated argument and called
her a ***** screaming from my lungs after being married 5 years.   For over a 3 months, I woke up in the morning feeling very angry and thoughts of anger would rush into my mind.  I think the first thoughts were....  that *****!   I need to leave her otherwise I will end up killing her.  This is what happened.  I ended up telling my family about my thoughts and I told them I needed to get a divorce otherwise I might do something stupid someday when we argue.  We divorced.  
 Now its been 3 years and a lot of crying.   I don't wake up in the morning thinking about her anymore or calling her
a *****, but now it seems to be my family.  I live with my parents and sister.  I now wake up in the morning angry
at them.  I sleep fine, but the moment I wake up, I think of really angry thoughts.   
 Since then I also suffer from severe anxiety tight places like in a car, bus, or airplane.  Before then I didn't have these issues.
 What is wrong with me?  I've never been on any drugs.  
 I've been to a psychologist, but he wanted to put me on drugs.  I said I want a natural way and not have to rely on drugs.
This is obviously an emotional anger issue, blocked energy, or something, and needs natural treatment or healing.
