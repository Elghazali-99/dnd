I have some indications that I might have this. Like, I worry that some of my frineds will eventually not want to be frineds with me cause they dont want to deal with me. I continuously have to be reasured that they aren't mad at me and it'sstarting to annoy them that I ask all the time. Sometimes i am way too hyper around them cause I can't help myself sometimes, like, I am so wound. I get incredubly anxious over the probablility of them being mad at me and when anyone is mad at me, I get incredable y upset and have to make sure they arne't. Like, I worry that they will block me on AIM and constantly have to check and i always worry that people are talking baout me cause they secretly don't like me. 
 there are times when I am soo happy I can't even control myself and say dumb annoying things, im just soo wound and then later in the day I am bwling my eyes out feeling really depressed that either the kid I like doesnt like me back, or my frineds are mad at me, whatever. I am extremely sensitive, tactile and emotional. I love people, I am outgoing and love interacting so its just when Ia m alone mostly that I feel that way but it is always in the back of my mind. I will feel sooo bad and worry cause of the smallest things. HELP! I have generalized anxiety and I take medication, it works so well compared to where Iw as a few years ago so my meducation is working well but this whole thing still makes me anxious a bit, there is alwasy somehting ont he back of my mind. 
 What do you tink, do I sound borderline or what? and what should I do??? HELP PLEASE!
