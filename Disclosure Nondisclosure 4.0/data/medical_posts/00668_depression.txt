I had been on Zoloft for 15 years, first on 100, then 50 for the last 7 years.  50 mg wasn't working as well for me anymore, and I wanted to try to switch my meds anyway to improve my sex life.  Well, after a rollercoaster of a year where I tried Wellbutrin first, then Nefazodone, then falling into a very deep depression I realized that I really do need to be on Zoloft.  The other pills didn't really help my drive, but they did make sex more pleasurable and had quicker/easier orgasms.  Now that I am going back, I am devastated to be losing that part of my life again.  Is there anything I can do?  I know that increasing Zoloft will work against the sex issue, but I may need to go higher than 50.  I also know that you can augment drugs like Wellbutrin (I was on this combo for 2 months and I think it could work again).  Or do I just accept that I have to trade in my sex life for my emotional well-being?  Any ideas/advice would be great.  I am so scared that I am doing the wrong thing here.  Thanks.
