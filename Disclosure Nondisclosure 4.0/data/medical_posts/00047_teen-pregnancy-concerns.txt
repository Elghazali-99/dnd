Hi! Let me explain my situation to you: me and my boyfriend do not have sex anymore because of my intense fear of getting pregnant. However a few weeks ago I gave him oral sex and he ejaculated. About 10- 20 minutes later we dry humped (grinding my naked vagina on his naked shaft, but not the tip of his penis). Since then I have lost a lot of weight (originally weighing 110 now weighing 102), due to recent illness and stress from starting school. I have an anxiety disorder so usually the first couple days of school I do not eat at all and I'm constantly on the edge of a panic attack. My period was due 10 days ago, and I've been having pregnancy symptoms for the past week. (Swollen tender breasts, random cramping, headaches.) Is there a chance I could be pregnant? I took a dollar store pregnancy test just the other day which turned out negative, but god knows how reliable it was coming from the dollar store. Or am I just very late due to high stress and schedule change? Please help!
