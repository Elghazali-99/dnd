Hi,
I've been in a relationship with someone with an anger problem. Eventually he split up with me and started seeing another girl and for a while I was really down but otherwise everything was ok. However I recently started seeing someone as well (whom I got to know through him ages ago) and when he found out his anger towards me returned worse then ever. He seems determined to make all our friends turn against me and constantly wants to hang out with  this guy i'm seeing. Its getting really awkward (last time we went to the same party he turned his back on me constantly which pretty much froze all conversations. Then he started telling me that i just go around f*ing all of his friends and that im really desperate) I tried to be nice to him but I just got him even more angry. He is turning a bit psycho now (making a point of organising events and inviting everyone but me) and Im worried he will put off my new partner from seeing me (he is a bit worried about getting caught up in my exes anger issues) and will definitely cause a lot of problems around our common friends. They always have to choose which one of us to invite to events.
  I'm starting to suspect that it is my quietness and meekness that always gets him angry, no matter how i try to make things up with him. He regularly falls out with most of his friends but they just tend to reutrn his anger and i think it works quite well for them - i cant do it though, im just not able to be angry. Do you think there's anything i could do to smooth things out? I was thinking of just leaving him to deal with his anger but i have heard of some of his exes who stopped dealing with him and he still hates them. Im not worried about what he thinks of me, i just dont want to lose any friends because of this. :(
