My Mother is 78 years old suffering from depression, dementia, failure to thrive since losing her husband two years ago.  She had colon cancer in 1995 and they removed a foot of her colon and surrounding lymph nodes without any other cancer treatment needed.  She had a follow up colonoscopy in August 2001 and this is the only one she has had.  She is refusing any diagnostic testing including labs as she has stated she is just wanting to die naturally. She has had chronic diarrhea for two and one half years and is now resulting in fecal incontinence.   She has always suffered from low sodium levels and unfortunately her MD has been prescribing long term use and dosages that are too high on the medications Ambien which she has taken 13 yrs. 20 mg hs,  Valium 5 mg 20 mg daily and she takes Phenobarbital 90 mg daily for epilepsy.  This overuse of medication has now led to 2 ER visits due to falling down the stairs and in the shower several times resulting in severe head blows.   She is now suffering diarrhea resulting in complete incontinence at least 6 times daily.  The stools have a very foul odor.  Labs performed at the ER visits also confirmed the long term medication use has resulted in elevated liver enzyme levels, yet of course is still being prescribed these medications.  She refuses to tell the MD about her diarrhea and symptoms and will not allow me to come with her for her MD visits.  Do her symptoms indicate a possibility of colon cancer recurrence.  I am handling being her caregiver alone as the rest of my family refuses to help.  Any suggestions would be so appreciated.
