I had a great psychiatrist for years til 2014 when he closed his practice. Since then I had one doc who was purely giving me prescriptions after prescriptions for my bipolar II. None of them were psychiatric drugs and I was getting severely depressed and am getting worse. I had found one doc and thought she would be great for me but on the second visit she seemed very frustrated with me, hardly did not make any eye contact with me and told me that I was "a hard patient" because the drugs on the market don't seem to work for me. I also have had about 30 ECTs. She got up twice from her desk and banged her hands on her desk and said, "Do you know how hard it is to be a psychiatrist?" She kept asking me why I was taking Depakote and Klonopin and that I should ask my prior doc why I was on them. There was no talking to her. She told me that she didn't know what to do with me. I stayed quiet and let her rant and she then handed me a script and said, "I'll see you in 2 weeks." I left and vowed never to come back to her. I went home and just cried. I have more anxiety than ever and my depression is worse than ever. 
Don't know what to do now.
