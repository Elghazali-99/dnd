Hi.
I,m Dave and I am 41 years old
 I do not know where to start,I have been married for 5 months Now to my Beautiful Loving wife..
We have had Problems like most Financially e.t.c and My wife unfortunately has has problems with alcohol which hasn't helped but now she is Getting better.
 I am a peaceful Person by Nature yet Once In a  while I loose it and last night that Happened after having a few drinks myself but also Before as My Wife and I had a silly argument over dirt on my shirt which I got upset and got out of the Car to Buy a Tshirt..Anyway I got back to The House and She was not there so I decided to go out and Drink for the 1st time in a month as I have not been drinking to help her and we been doing really well on this health tip.
 I smashed the Tv which was our wedding present and kicked and smashed the window and she had every right to be terrified so she went to neighbours and called the Police and I got arrested.Today my wife and I have had long chats on the Phone and I am going to Seek medical help when I get back to the Uk.
 I have had anger management before to something similar 10 years ago with My X and that was a horrible yet educational time I know i need more of this but i want to get to the route of My problem wether I have Bipolar,anxiety Trauma i just need help and My wife is willing to stick with me through all of this as I have been with her all the way with her alcohol issues..Obviously I have alcohol issues  as well when I drink like that and then Smash the Tv which we loved to watch every night..I just do not know why I did that to someone Who is my soulmate and best friend..I upset her so much and her mam and dad who found out and they are the most wonderful people you could ever meet.
 I seen a Psychiatrist when I was aged 5 and then again when I was 11 as I had behaviour issues which My adopted parents could now work out.Yes I was Adopted when I was 6 weeks old, My mother was Young and gave me up..The more I think about it then That could be a root to my Problem amongst other things..Anyway I just know I need help 
 Thanks for reading and If anyone could suggest anything i would much appreciate it as I am feeling Extremely remorseful and Hurt that I could Do that..
