I'm 16 years old girl and I think I'm depressed. I feel like there is no reason for me to live anymore. (I'm sorry in advance for any mistakes, English is not my native language). I don’t enjoy doing anything I used to like, and nothing is important to me anymore. My grades are constantly dropping because I can't concentrate, I stopped hanging out with my friends, and I have troubles sleeping. 
Though, the thing that bothers me the most is that I have no feelings. I am not even sad. I wish I was sad because then I would had something to complain about. Even cutting stopped being affective (which is a good thing I guess (:  ).  Everything is just pointless, and it makes me feel like death is the best option, but then again I don’t want to commit a suicide. I have been thinking of that for years but I wouldn't do it. 
My parents sent me to therapy at the beginning of the year because they said I became withdraw, as if I was a stranger in their home, but I stopped after 2 sessions because it was too hard for me. I don’t want to be back there, but I don’t know what else to do.
I don’t know if that’s depression. It has been like that for a long time, but not worse. Perhaps dysthymia?
