I am a senior and losses in family and age has given me long term grief and depression.  I tried Trazadone for about a year but didn't seem to get much help and I think it was making my sleeping problems worse.  I then went to Sertraline (Zoloft) and have been on a half dose for 9 days (25 mg) and will go to full dose of 50 mg on day 10. The side effects seem to add to my fatigue, which I already had due to grief/bereavement.   
 I haven't given up on Sertraline as I'm yet to have a run at full dose.  But wonder if this is an old drug and the move to something more recent may be worth thinking about, discussing with my doctor.  I am now under the care of my family doctor, not a psychiatrist.  
 Both my grief, and the symptoms of as well as side effects are just troubling, not dangerous in my mind.  But, I would like to get more enjoyment out of the life I have left (being a senior I am on the end-run for life).  It see in my bereavement group many suffer for years over the loss of a loved one, and perhaps never really get over it.  My reason for seeking help from drugs  is to help me sleep (that could reduce fatigue) and soften what I believe is depression.  My family history has no known problems with depression, and I have lived a long life absent any troubling depression.. of course there have been many disappointments, but not depression until now.
 I suppose a depressing side effect of new patented medications is the cost, which may be so high that along can make one depressed.  The Sertraline is very affordable.
