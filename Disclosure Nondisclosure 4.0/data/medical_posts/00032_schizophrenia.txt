I'm 14 and really petrified by all of this. Basically i'm hearing these voices like faint ones but i feel as if they're getting louder and louder, if i'm walking in the streets they will tell me to kill or seriously hurt the people or even rob them and i always so NO! to them and they say ''you know you really want to'' and then i reply no again so then i would just try and ignore, also 24:7 i feel like someone or people are spying on me like i cant get changed in my room because i feel like there is a secret camera somewhere and then if i walk into a room i always feel everyone is looking and talking about me, i cant walk down a road without thinking ''omg someone is going to kill or kidnap or hurt me'' and if i'm sitting down or lying down i see things move like i see the walls closing in or i will see a spider or a creature moving and i feel that if i turn on the tv a face will pop up and say ''i will kill you'' and my sleep is bad i wake up really early like 2:00am 5am or 6-7am but before i sleep i drop into a strong delusion where i will hear life threatning voices like screaming and voices saying you have to die then the screams carry on like its never ending it always happens before i fall asleep.  :( Any ideas?
