Hi my name is Bryan, and I suffer from schizophrenia and I'm also bipolar. I feel very lonely. My family doesn't know what to say anymore they just sit and say nothing whenever my mental problems is aggravated. I guess because that when they do say something I usually don't like it and it turns into a wicked fight. I'm afraid I'm getting to where I want to pull someone down with me whenever I hear voices or have huge mood swings. I don't have many friends, well none really. They are all online so I have a hard time trusting them. 
 I say I hate god because if I do manage to live my full life without hurting myself god during judgement day will send me to a firey hell of a bottomless pit if I don't change, or at least according to my grandmother on my mother's side. The voices say, "you're a loser.", and You're going to burn in hell. 
 I'm on 30 mg of Zyprexa and it's making me eat a lot more food than I need so it's making me gain weight. I try to not eat a lot but it's really difficult since whenever the mood swings and the voices are gone I'm in a deep depression and that makes me turn to food for comfort, but the feeling is only temporary. 
 I'm afraid if nothing changes I will attempt suicide again. I need help. I'm also having trouble with violent thoughts such as if I'm mad at a person or if I'm having paranoid thoughts about people that might be making fun of me I always picture myself pulling out a handgun and blowing someone's brains out or pulling out a knife and stabbing them to death. I'm worried that if someone says the wrong thing to me I will eventually snap and hurt or kill someone. These violent thoughts have been going through my head for several months now. 
 I feel worthless, and extremely insecure. If I'm talking to someone that I like and if that outcome or their reactions  doesn't go the way I like I overanalyze the situation and then just think to myself, he or she thought you were a loser and etc.
