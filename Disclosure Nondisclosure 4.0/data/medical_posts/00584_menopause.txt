Hi everyone, I don't know how much more I can cope with all this, I have had problems all my life with pms sweating, mood swings depression anxiety the list goes on and on, had 3 children all born with problems harelip cleft palate, blindness in one eye and I kidney,  since I have been diagnosed with hashimotos  disease I have been reading a lot about it especially the pregnancy bit and the 3 main things for deformatives is the above,.
My concern is have I had trouble with my thyroid all my life and GPS have not picked it up.
Stared on thyroxine 4 years ago and hrt, I don't think the two like each other, hand combined tablets now have Merina coil fitted and on ostigel, if I take the two pumps of ostigel I go bonkers, and my thyroid levels drop.
I am not sleeping, I am angry and anxious hot and sweaty, have no interest in anything, not worked for 3 years as I am always sick, does anyone have menopause and hashimotos, and can advise what next, if it wasn't for my children I don't think I would be here.  Sorry for the doom and gloom on a Monday morning.
