Hi i'm 13 years old and a girl. For a long time i have wanted to die. Never in a million years would i ever be so open about this, but its all anonymous so here i go. I'm extremely suicidal, i self harm a lot and starve myself. I have no one to turn to or tell. If i even drop hints my dad says i'm being ridicioulous and melodramatic. Sometimes he calls me an attention seeker, but if only he knew. I never show my scars and keep all of it from them because i know they won't help but just judge me and think i'm a freak. I don't know where to go and who to turn to, i have confided in a friend with similar friends but we don't speak often or see each other. I can't keep going on like this, i need someone to help me before i do something stupid like take my own life. Days like these aren't too bad, i just feel really hopeless, worthless and sad. But other days get so bad i feel like i'm drowning but no one can see. Like i'm screaming but no one can hear. It sounds so stupid, like surley that can't be going on in someones head? And surely someone of that age can't feel that way when there are people out there who have it so much worse than me. But i do, i don't know where else to turn and who to go to. All i know is i need help and somewhere to go. Sorry for bothering you.
