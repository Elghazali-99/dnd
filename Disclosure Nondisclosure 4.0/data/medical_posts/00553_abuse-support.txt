I have a 10 year old little boy who at the age of 3 went through a very traumatic circumstance and was a victim of physical and emotional abuse. Not by myself might i add just to clear things up a bit.  He was taken from me for a year and a half and has undergone individual/family therapy since than.  He is now and has been having issues in school when it come to the teachers, listening, following directions and getting along with the other children.  I want to do whatever necessary to help him have a better future and a better life as a child but I don't know where to start since I am not a therapist.  I do not want him to go to therapy unless he is repressing what happened to him.  But I don't believe that is the case.  I would just like opinions on what I can do to help him.  He is saying things at school with reference to his teacher that are not appropriate, he is constantly getting into fights with the other kids, and he is always being teased.  He is very clingly as a result of what he went through and anyones advice is greatly appreciated.  I just don't know how to help him and I want for him to be a happy normal, functioning child and part of society.
