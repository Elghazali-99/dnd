I don't know how much longer I can take this pain. I've had my fair share of ocd obsessive thoughts, low self esteem, and especially anxiety. I don't know what feeling normal is like anymore, because what most people consider normal I consider a blessing to feel. Let me cut to the chase when I say that I've always had some sort of obsessive thoughts. However I believe my low self esteem and anxiety started when I began high school. I'm now a senior and if anything it's like everything is worse, everyone is talking about college and what they're gonna do and I just sit here completely uninterested. I hate change. Senior year started off so well and so perfectly, I had a girlfriend who I thought was crazy about me, but then I came to realize that wasn't the case at all. You wouldn't believe it if I told you, but my friend in late October committed suicide and a couple of days later I found out my girlfriend cheated on me at some Halloween party. I've never felt so low and worthless in my life now that I think about it, but  worst part about it is that at the time I felt nothing. I couldn't cry and I couldn't even bear to think about what had happened. I had to be strong for my other friends and help them first, because I'll always put them before me. If they're not okay then neither am I. I'm tired of feeling like this and I'm tired of feeling worthless and like I'm not worth anything to anyone. Help me.
