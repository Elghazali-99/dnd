Helping someone recieve support and treatment is essential but before that can be approached the person must understand there is something wrong in their life. That they need help to begin with. As well I understand only a psychiatrist can make a diagnosis but its hard for a person to approach the idea of borderline personality disorder because the term sounds so ugly. I have knowledge of it (as a consumer, different diagnosis) and have reached out to people I know and work with who ended up getting diagnosed but it was an uphill battle. And some were misdiagnosed with say depression and once they understood that it was bpd, they were able to get the specific help they needed (as the treatment is different). Since this comes up from time to time, how can you help someone understand this aspect of their life? If people are diagnosed with it how did you come to terms with the diagnosis and accept it? And what is a good way to help someone else do so in a supportive fashion. Any ideas?
