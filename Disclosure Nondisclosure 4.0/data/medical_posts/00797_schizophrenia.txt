I have been a single mom for 24 years working many hours to raise my 2 fantastic kids. My son has always been a little shy & exceptionally caring giving optimistic clean helpful., hardworking & ambitious. He started developing schizophrenia when he was 17 yet didn't show full signs of it until he has 23 in which case I was confused & had no idea what was happening. He moved back home with me. It was just myself & him. It was very difficult to find any assistance for him. Thankfully he has now been on proper medication for 2 years. His symptom's seldom occur yet I know he is still dealing with them. The side effects of the meds make him very lethargic, extremely  messy, sleepy, uncaring, sometimes cruel  & weight gain. He is not comfortable going out & has removed all his friends. I have had to try to clean his living areas with shovel as it is such a mess & been destroyed. I am the only person he has to lean on besides his sister who doesn't live near. I often feel I am not dealing with his medication symptom's properly & do not have enough patience. As with anyone suffering this illness he does not deserve to go thru this he is a wonderful person who's life has changed. If there is anything I can do to help him as I have no support please let me know. Thank you.
