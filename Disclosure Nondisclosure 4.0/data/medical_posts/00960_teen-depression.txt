I want you to know I'm a teenager. I'm only 16. But I'm not like the other teenagers my age. I think I have depression. But I'll get to that. First off, I come from a good family. They are all Christians, they don't do drugs, don't do crimes, don't smoke, they don't even cuss. Most importantly, they don't believe in depression. i once tried to talk to them about it and they thought I had a demon inside me. i don't know what to do. Ive had these feelings for years, and they only get worse. i cry, i sob, over little things, everything hurts me. i don't have friends anymore at school, i can literally go through the whole day without talking to one person. and I don't feel like i have the strenght to have friends or relationships anyway. and i hate myself. Everything, i'm just so ugly and stupid and pathetic in my own eyes. I know others have to see it this way too. My grades are slipping to F's, they are Fs. life is just nothign to me. i don't have goals or aspirations or things i wanna do or things I like. i just feel so wrong all the time. I wanna hide and i want to hug all the time. My eating is out of control and I just want to sleep. i'm restless and tired at the same time. and I know these feelings can't be normal. I talked to my doctor once, when my parents weren't around, and she agreed I could have depression. but I mentioned the talk to my parents and now they think the doctor is crazy. maybe I'm crazy. I feel crazy, escecailly when I get so worked up over little things. My parents love me I know, and they don't believe in depression for religious regions. But what else could be wrong with me? i need to know, before I really reach a breaking point and something happens. Again.
