Hey guys, I'm in year 11 in high school and my stress is going through the roof. I'm not normally a stressed person and normally I don't get stressed about exams or tests but my year 11 exams are coming up soon and my stress has been crazy. I cry so much and it gets to the point where I physically feel like I'm going to throw up for no reason, even if I'm not thinking about exams or work. I can't concentrate, I can't think and I find myself reading the same sentence over and over again when I'm studying. Im grumpy and tired all the time even if I get a 10-12 hour sleep. I'm healthy, I go to the gym and I drink plenty of water. I've got plenty of study resources and and I go to the library a few times a week as well as studying at home. My family is very supportive and I've tried to be in a positive frame of mind the whole time. I've even tried meditation and yoga. I don't have any mental disorders that I'm aware of, but I just can't shake this feeling that I'm going to fail, ruin my life and not have the opportunity to do something with my life. I don't know what to do, I've tried everything. Please help!!
