Hi there! So I just posted in the MedHelp suggestions forum about starting a "hobbies club". Lets face it, Medhelp can be a tad bit depressing sometimes for all, whether posting or assisting with an issue. I know for certain communities which deal with mood disorders and other emotional aspects, it would be nice for members to relate in a way that makes them feel good. Getting lost in a hobby or the discussion of same, can be quite a relief. I was thinking that it would be great to start some forums based on similarities and interest, to kind of help with all the heavy stuff. 
 Various Activities such as: Book Clubs, Writers, Music/Musicians/Cooking, Sewing, Fashion, Home, and some more was among what I had in mind. If this is something that would interest you, maybe you can post in the Medhelp Suggestions forum too. Maybe if alot of members post, the mods will take it more seriously.  You are also free to add your own interests if you please. Thanks in advance and take care.
