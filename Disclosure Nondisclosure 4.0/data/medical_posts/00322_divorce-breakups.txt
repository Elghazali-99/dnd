My ex husband and I divorced back in 2005. Due to him cheating. Anyhow I called it quits. At the start of our seperation we were always fighting. Till one day I decided I was no longer going to lend myself to that behavior. If I wanted to be happy I had to get away from that. Anyhow, since our divorce became final he refuses to talk to me when it pertains to our kids. If he has anything to say he'll send the kids to tell me. My kids don't always understand what he needs/wants. I don't understand why its so hard for him to communicate with me or why he refuses to talk to me. Few times he's spoken to me he has attitude or a loud nasty tone. Which I honestly don't give him my time. Recently he'll be taking them on a trip out of the country. On their passports as emergency contact he put his brother. Not taking me (their mother) into any consideration. Its been a long while since our divorce. Why does he act like he hates me..if it should be the other way around. I've got 2 sisters whom are also divorced. They get along great with their exes..how is that done? Or could that be possible for me too? I'm not asking to be best friends just to be able to be civil when it pertains to our kids..is that to much to ask for?
