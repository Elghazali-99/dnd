hi all,
 i've had this fear of being schizophrenic for a few months now.  one day when i was really scared my mom called my cousin, who is a doctor, and told her about it.  but i was only hearing "voices" late at night when i was half asleep and my cousin said this was totally normal. but then the next month i was wondering why she hadn't asked me to babysit her kids in a while and i thought: "oh she probably doesn't want me near her babies and thinks that i'm schizophrenic and hear things like "KILL THOSE KIDS".  i had never "heard a voice" say this it. i thought it and i know i thought it.  but as soon as i had this thought i became terrified.  now whenever i see those kids i think about what i thought that day and "hear a voice" that says kill those kids.  im pretty sure this is my own thought but im a hypochondriac and my brain tries to convince me that im really hearing a "voice" in my head and its not my own thinking.  this is the only "voice" i ever hear/think.  this didn't happen ever until i developed a fear of being schizophrenic.  i am totally in touch with reality and i only "hear this voice" when i think about what i thought that day, not like all the time. i can be around the kids and not "hear" anything. but once i think about having that thought, it happens.  im still pretty sure that its only a thought but my brain is like what if im really hearing a voice?  i am well aware that no one is actually speaking these things to me. i just fear that im hearing a voice in my head. does this sound like schizophrenia or is this me being a hypochondriac? (im medically diagnosed as a hypochondriac)
