I'm a 18 year old female, and I've been having issues with this since I was about 11. I just can't motivate myself to ever do anything- I literally spend an hour just staring at some random object and trying to convince myself to go get food or use the bathroom. And I just have these downward mood spirals, where one thought just drags me down into this pit of despair where all my bad thoughts just cycle around and around. I'll just sit in my closet sobbing for hours, and I can't explain to anyone why I'm crying if they catch me. Even if I want to tell them, it likes my throat locks up and I feel like I'm being tortured. I don't think I'd actually do it, but during these times, I have thoughts of suicide. Really elaborate ones too, not just jumping out a window or swallowing pills. Like I said, I don't think I'll actually do it, though. They're always elaborate enough that it has to be planned for a future date- and I pull myself out of my downward mood swings after a good nights sleep.
I don't cut, but I kinda have a tendency to bite my hand in an effort to calm myself down- I don't break the skin or anything, though. It's kinda my equivalent to punching a wall when I get upset, since I don't want to damage our apartment and get my parents mad.
 I'm not sure if this is just something caused by all the hormones that come with being a teenager, or if it's something more. It'd be nice to know it's just hormones and I'll grow out of it. How do you tell the difference?
