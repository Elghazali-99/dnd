I ordered the original Kindle keyboard 2nd gen the day it was available. Same with 1st gen Kindle Fire, and I own a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle PaperWhite as well. Having that familiarity with Kindles I hope gives me some credibility for the HDX 7. The speakers are the best in the line. The screen is amazing, the speed is unparalleled for gaming and streaming, which is the only possible challenge to prior models. In the spirit of full disclosure, I've only owned mentioned Kindles and a Samsung Galaxy smart phone, no iPads, Samsung tablets or Barnes Noble e-readers etc so take it from there. Can't speak to charging complaints because I keep a charging cord next to my bed and two more around the apt and I plug my phone in every night and my Kindle every morning when I awake. After 2 weeks, in one day my Kindle HDX has never been below 40 and average end of day is about 65 so I've never had one day of usage as an inconvenience. For those that find charging once a day annoying, hmm, two days should still be good for most average uninterrupted use. I also ordered the Origami case as its enclosure and I love it as well. Stands the device with equal stability in landscape and portrait, and feels protective for minor drops or spills.
