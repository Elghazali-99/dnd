There are many things I like about Amazon Fire TV, but I get tired of having to reset it a lot of times. I have to unplug and plug it in after every use with Netflix. For some reason the screen turns white the second time I use the app ( would be great if you could fix this issue) Considering it took me an hour to get it initially started because of an update, which makes no sense for a new product it has worked so so... It freezes up when streaming videos on HULU a good bit. I would like to have the option to remove shows from your watch list, especially when I view a show for the first time and don't like it. Sometimes the shows will start and then go right back to the homepage. This should not be happening without a button being depressed. I guess everything new has bugs but my question would be when is Amazon going to update the product and fix some of these bugs
