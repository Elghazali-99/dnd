It's always good to buy on sale. The reason I purchased this style of Kindle, it's small , just like a paperback book, and very portable. So far so good. I'm enjoying every minute of use. The OS is very friendly user driven. Easy to navigate. Shopping, apps and books, is very easy. The user-interface takes a bit to get use too. If you are use to using tablets with iOS, windows, or Android there is a very short learning curve.The one aspect I like is the ability to group your items. Games, books, and the ability to make a new group. Keeps the confusion down.The clarity and speed of the Kindle is great. I'm very impressed by it's sharp image. I only use a wi-fi connection so the movies stream without a problem.Well worth the purchase on sale.
