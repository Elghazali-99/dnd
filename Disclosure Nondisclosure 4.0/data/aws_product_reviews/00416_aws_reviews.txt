The reason this is the 2nd best purchase, is because my Kindle Fire HD is 1st... This has been a great purchase and has so many options available when connected with Amazon Prime. I have never been a big TV Watcher in the last few years, but I am back to it a bit with this device coupled with Amazon Prime. I watch Movies and TV Shows with my wife and it is great. If you spend much time in front of the TV, then I would say this is a must have and I love it almost as much as my Kindle Fire HD..
