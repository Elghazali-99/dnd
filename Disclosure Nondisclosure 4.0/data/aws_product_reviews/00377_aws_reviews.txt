Just setup my new FireTV ordered via my Amazon account and so far so good so fast. Setup time: 10 minutes.The good:1. NO setup to access Amazon content.I am already a Prime member so once I had my wifi setup the FireTV did a quick scan of the internet for updates before running the tutorial video. To my surprise once the tutorial was completed I was welcomed by web my Amazon username (Hello insert name)complete with my Watch List and Video Library. No additional steps needed to access my content. Cool and creepy at the same time. But, who am I kidding my electronic footprint is large.2. Super fast. The FireTV interface (content menu system) is quick and straightforward. It's a better faster interface than any of my other devices I own that streams Amazon content (PS3, XBOX deprecated, iPad, Vizio SmartTV, and wifi enabled BD player). I do not have a Netflix membership so I haven't tried it yet (Maybe there's a free trial attached, but will Amazon allow that). I played a movie out of my Amazon Video Library and it started instantly. Missing is the your content is still loading delay. I am telling you the movie started immediately.3. PRIME content. I read some comments that stated posters had trouble being able to easily identify PRIME content. I am not having the same problem. All PRIME content displays the blue PRIME banner in the upper left hand corner as it does on all the other devices mentioned above. So maybe there has been a software update since. Which means Amazon heard you.4. Power. I was concerned over the lack of a power button on the remote or FireTV unit itself which I thought meant the device would have to be manually disconnected from the power source. NOT SO The device goes to sleep (no power LED activity) after a set period of time and is easily awaken by the press of a button on the remote. Perfect.The bad:1. Haven't found it yet.
