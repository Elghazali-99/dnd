As an owner of various models of Roku and Apple TVs, I didn't really need yet another streaming device, But, I decided to give it a try. It works great. I do like the voice search feature. We tried watching some of our favorites like Midsommer Murders. All of the seasons and episodes showed up which was nice. But only a few of the earlier seasons were watchable for free, and a few of the more recent were available for 5.99, but most were unavailable. That happened to several other BBC series that we tried to watch. However, the movies we have watched streamed without a hitch with good picture and sound.
