I have read some of the previous reviews and you shouldn't believe everything that is written. First I'm a die hard Kindle user and love every single one I have owned.This one is incredibly light (weight). I bought the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 before this one and even though I loved it, it was pretty heavy. The screen resolution is incredible. It's crystal clear and just looks amazing. Now I kind of was debating waiting for the 8.9 to come out but this 7 inch is the prefect size to throw in my purse. I read previous reviews that stated there is a purple border around the edges of the book your reading. I don't have that and find that reading a book with this Kindle is easy on the eyes.I haven't used the Mayday button yet but I'm sure it's up to par with Amazon's wonderful customer service. I'm unsure what else to say but that you will be highly impressed with this Kindle.
