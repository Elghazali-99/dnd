the voice recognition makes finding content so easy, even worked with hulu+I already had a mogo pro so I tried out the games and for a android console they are first ratefar better then oyua which i'm sorry to say i'll never use again.the tv and music content and menu's are very quick thanks to the very powerful hardware under the hoodoverall I'm positive that this unit will kill roku and apple tveven google chromecast better be careful (I own all these units so I speak from experience)
