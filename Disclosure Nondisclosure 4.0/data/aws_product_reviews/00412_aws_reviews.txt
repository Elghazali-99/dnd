I love the features of the Amazon Fire TV, the price is right, the interface is great, but it after less than 5 minutes keeps disconnecting from my WIFI and giving a network error message. Mind you my router is about 5 feet from it. Needless to say because of this I cant watch Amazon prime TV shows or movies on it. I have an Apple TV in my sons room way down the hall also connected to WIFI, the Apple TV never disconnects from WIFI. I would love to be able to use the unit, not sure why this is happening but I may have to return it. Shame....
