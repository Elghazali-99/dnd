Received my Amazon Fire TV 2 weeks ago. It works good very responsive with quad core but the interface seems very limited on apps the main ones are there Amazon of course, Net Flix, and a must have PLEX. but missing a lot of others, Still like ROKU 3 as a main streaming unit a little slower but chucked full of apps. Amazon needs to get with it if they are going to lead the pack here. also the speech search is not useable with Net Flix or any of the other apps only works with amazon. this is definitely loaded heavy on the amazon side, It makes no sense to have a great feature that cant work with the whole package.I would recommend to others but tell them of the draw backs so they know what they are getting in to here.Great product but needs some one to help it along.
