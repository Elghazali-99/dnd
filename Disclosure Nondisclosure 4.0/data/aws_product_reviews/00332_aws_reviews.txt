Listen, I am basically an Amazon fanboy...I do a lot of shopping thru Amazon, so it pains me to write this review, but it's gotta be done. Corporate stupidity just HAS to be addressed.I have a couple Roku's, a Google Chromecast, a couple TiVo's, etc.(1) Voice search is nice, but searching overall is UNACCEPTABLE as it is NOT a universal search, like on Roku (i.e...search ALL sources for a movie, etc, not just Amazon).(2) Will there EVER be a way, Amazon (are you listening), to search Prime for the FREE content The Fire TV doesn't do it. Unacceptable.(3) The Roku 3 has a headphone jack on the remote...BRILLIANT...this simply has to be a standard feature on these kinds of boxes...but the Fire TV does not have it. Unacceptable.(4) No HBOGO. Unacceptable.(5) No volume control. OK, none of these boxes have what would be a VERY desirable feature...a volume control on the remote...so the Fire TV does not lack here compared to the competition, but it sure seems like Amazon should have figured out how desirable a volume control would be, and included it.(6) Adding android apps is very hard for average users.
