I have a first generation Kindle Fire, it did every well, but was heavy and not as fast as I hoped graphics wise for gaming, which is why I upgraded to the HDX. This new tablet is blisteringly fast and completely fluid with no lag. Movies, books, and games are crystal clear, and I can now even read PDF's easily, which was a chore on the old Kindle Fire. The best part is the battery life and light weight, I use this kindle all day on one charge. I'm so happy with it, considering the 8.9 inch also for my wife.I can think of no flaws, but if a problem comes up with this device, I'll update, I've only had it a week.
