I just received my Fire TV box today, and it is everything promised and then some, imho. I've been exploring it (and got started on Fargo) for the last 3 hours and the menus are intuitive, the voice search is quite nice, and I love the way the remote feels in my hand. A value buy, in my opinion, especially if you are an amazon instant video subscriber. I haven't even explored all the other sources.
