I would give it a 4 star review if it didn't keep having reoccurring issues with wired Ethernet connection. For some reason I have to keep taking out the Ethernet cable and plugging it back in the device in order for it to recognize the wired connection. Now, the funny thing is that the wifi connection works fine. The reason that is funny or ironic is that typically that is where most devices have an issue when it comes to internet connection. The reason I choose being wired in is because I want fast data transfer.. Now, the Fire works well with everything else.. very smooth and the interface is well laid out...
