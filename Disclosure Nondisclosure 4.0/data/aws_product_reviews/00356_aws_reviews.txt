I assumed, based on the product description, that access to 40,000 Songs meant that I could play my own 2800 songs on the cloud that I also pay Amazon a couple hundred dollars a year for. Why not a cloud player app for crying out loud. If I'm mistaken and I CAN access my cloud music, I sure appreciate it if somebody could tell me how. That's why I bought it. I might return it because I can already get everything by Amazon's own content through other means. Kind of a drag that I can't play my AMAZON PURCHASED music through my expensive home theater. I couldn't care less about viewing my Amazon cloud photos on my home theater.
