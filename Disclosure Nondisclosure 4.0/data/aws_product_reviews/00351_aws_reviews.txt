I noticed within a week that some movies I had watched in the past on PRIME for FREE are NO longer on the Free list. And where did all the Chick-Flick movies go we have to pay for each thing now still deciding if this is getting returned or not. The equipment is awesome and set up was fast and so so easy, but I didn't purchase it to PAY for each and everything I want to watch. I love Amazon and shop all the time, but .... why take the movies off the FREE list for PRIME
