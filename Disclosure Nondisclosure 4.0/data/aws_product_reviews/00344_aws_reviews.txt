Out of the box mine updated and setup fine. - No ProblemsMy biggest complaint is that Voice Search only searches Amazon and a very few things from HuluPlus... Should search ALL content from at least the Big 3 (Netflix, AmazonPrime HuluPlus)Had some picture glitches on HuluPlus Netflix. I switched over to my Roku3 on the same content and worked just fine...I didn't like the Menus... Not as easy as Roku...Netflix looks and works WAY BETTER on Roku3...I think this might become a player in the market that Roku owns... Maybe... But has too many problems for me to bet on that at full price... I might buy one later when they go on sale and the software's been tweaked... Along with more channels added...Considering you can buy a Roku 3 for the same money or less, with a HUGE list of public private channels, also search that really works... The Fire TV is, at this point, a very bad choice... Don't pay them list price to be a Fire TV Beta Tester...
