I have had Apple TV and Roku for over a year and I can say without reservation that the Amazon Fire TV is far better for two reasons: 1. The program/movie I want to watch starts IMMEDIATELY with a single click, unlike Roku and Apple TV which can take forever at times after several clicks. 2. Voice search. Having to type search can be cumbersome and a nuisance. Unless I want to watch one of the ITunes movies I own on the Apple TV, I always use the Fire. It's simply better
