I got mine the day after it was unveiled. Out of the box it required an update. It's the fastest UI of any other box that I have. Currently there aren't as many apps as I would like to see, but I imagine they'll be coming soon.I am not able to get my Kindle Fire HDX to Mirror the display yet. It won't connect for some reason.Including more apps coming soon, apparently the Amazon Music app will be available soon as well. Games are very cool. I don't have the separate controller, but have had fun with the games you can play with the remote.These aren't mediocre games you would find on the Roku 3, but high quality mobile games. Of course the games aren't full on Xbox or PS4 style, but beautifully scaled mobile games you'd play on your smartphone or tablet.If you get your entertainment from the Amazon ecosystem, this is an excellent device.
