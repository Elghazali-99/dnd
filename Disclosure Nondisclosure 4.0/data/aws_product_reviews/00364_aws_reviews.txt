ok, i'm not going to lie, this thing as the fastest setup. i thought i was seeing things when i turned it on for the first time. apparently this device is connected to your amazon prime account so once you turn it on, it automatically literally goes straight to your prime account without signing in. i seriously had to call customer service because i was really creeped out on if i signed in or not. anyway, this thing is way better than the roku. though i do wish they had a iphone app for it because the remote is so small and i tend to lose it alot. its pretty much the same formate on the roku when it comes to Netflix and Hulu. it goes to the next episode atomically like samsung smart tv and the roku but i guess its a common thing but amazon prime you have to select the next episode itself. i seem to see this in a lot of other streaming devices.
