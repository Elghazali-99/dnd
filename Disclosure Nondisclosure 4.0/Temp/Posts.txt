66   0   The idea is to add 3 numbers at a time and see how high we can count!

318   0   Hi All
318   1   I&apos;m Awkwardturtle, I&apos;m 21 finishing an animal science degree at uni planning on doing psychology next year
318   1   I think this is also my 4th version of the ReachOut forums I have been on!!!
320   0   Hi!!!
320   1   I&apos;m currently in England so if I reply at random times (such as now... 2:12am) it&apos;s because I&apos;m actually awake!!!
320   0   shall try to reply at normal times as well
320   1   My family has 10 horses, 3 cats and two dogs
320   1   I love country music (and all others except rap)
320   1   I love reading
320   1   I am the messiest person ever!!
324   1   I’ve had a few experiences with getting professional help over the years, due to a variety of reasons.
324   1   In high school, starting in yr 11, I ended up seeing the school counselor after my mum spoke to my year level coordinator about things that were going on at home.
324   0   (So her motives for doing this weren’t to “get me help”, but it did).
324   0   At the time I never really liked the lady and didn’t think it was helping much, but looking back now it was really fantastic to have someone I could go vent to about all the stuff that was going on at home.
324   0   Because I never really spoke to any of my friends about the stuff that was going on it was good to have someone to talk to.
324   0   I was also shit scared about being seen “walking to the counselors office” because of what people may have thought of me because their office was a little bit of a walk from class.
324   0   This was until one day someone sort of asked me why I was seeing a counselor.
324   0   This girl was the friendliest person in my year and I turns out she was seeing one of them too!!
324   0   So I wasn’t that weird.
324   0   No this didn’t rid me completely of my fear but it helped a little.
324   1   Then in yr 12 I ended up with cancer and chronic pain so my pain management guy one day recommended politely that I see a psychologist.
324   0   I saw this lady probably 10 or 12 times after treatment, and although I originally went to see her because of my illness, I ended up talking more about family crap and everything else!!
324   0   And this was never an issue, I was there to talk about what I needed to not!
324   1   I stopped seeing her just after I started uni.
324   1   Towards the end of my first year at uni things started going downhill a little bit and it was at that point I started promising myself I would find someone to talk to.
324   0   But promising myself and actually doing something is completely different.
324   0   To say I was absolutely terrified would be an understatement.
324   0   Over the period of about a year and a half I tried various ways of getting help.
324   0   My first attempt was sort of indirectly asking our family GP for a referral to a psychologist, and she was lovely about it, but I never got the courage to actually call either of the people she referred me too.
324   0   I also tried kids help line online counseling a couple of times and even then I was terrified but it did help a little bit.
324   0   However it wasn’t enough and their opening hours didn’t really work for me and I didn’t have the guts to ring up.
324   0   But the people at KHL really were lovely.
324   1   Finally at the end of second year I managed to force myself to a different doctor and get a referral to a psychologist.
324   0   This doctor again was brilliant and seemed to know what he was doing and didn’t ask too many questions.
324   0   There was a slight wait before I got in to see the psychologist but he was really helpful.
324   0   Because of my uni and sport commitments I was ridiculously busy which meant I wasn’t able to focus enough on, well, “therapy”.
324   0   So we decided that it would be best to keep my remaining sessions for that year until I had time to really focus on it.
324   0   I guess what I learnt from this is that to really be able to get anything from a psychologist etc you have to be willing to work with the professional.
324   0   It involves team work.
324   0   Later in the year things went really downhill and because of that I was referred to our local mental health team after ending up in the emergency room.
324   0   Through them I got referred to a case manager who also is my psychologist.
324   1   At the moment we are working together on Cognotive Analytical Therapy (CAT) and it really makes sense to me, and I guess is working.
324   0   Through the team I also got to see a psychiatrist for the first time.
324   0   I was terrified about this but it really wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be.
324   0   I guess what I thought I’d get from this was a diagnosis, because we’d already ruled out medication.
324   0   I guess what I’ve learnt from all this is It takes effort from both you and the professional for treatment to work
324   0   Never underestimate how helpful it is to have someone to just vent to, but that in order to get better you have to move past just venting and start looking for solutions.
324   0   You should never stop searching for help, if you get let down by one person (because unfortunately there are some not so great professionals out there) then keep searching for someone else because someone will be able to help.
324   0   One thing that has always helped me is music, whether it’s listening to it on the way to a psych session so I don’t think to much, or just relaxing with it when I was struggling.
324   1   I guess two songs that really lifted my mood or made me realize that I could make it through were Mountains – Lonestar, The impossible – Joe Nichols
324   0   P.S. the ReachOut site seems to be playing up and not letting me see pages so I will update this with links once it wants to work!!!
326   0   Guys, this has taken a horrible turn!
330   0   Awkwardturtle, nice work!
330   0   I agree, professional help can be great.
330   1   I went to a counsellor earlier this year for the first time, and I had no idea what to do.
330   0   But the guy was great, we just chatted about what was going on, and he really helped me to get some perspective on things.
330   0   We only had 2 or 3 sessions, but I felt a lot better afterwards, and I&apos;m doing a lot better now.
334   0   AHHHH Magga!!! Now i&apos;m gonna have Blue stuck in my head all day!!!
336   0   Hihi! So excited that we&apos;ve finally kicked off the forums, w00t!
336   0   So 5 random things about me...
336   1   I&apos;m obsessed with the West Wing - BEST. SHOW. EVER!
336   0   apart from every other awesome thing about it, it introduced me to apples and peanut butter.
336   0   Best snack in the world.
336   0   In fact I&apos;m eating it now
336   1   I used ReachOut.com back in 2002 (10 years ago!!!) when my boyfriend was going through a tough time, and i didn&apos;t know what to do - and now I work here!!!
336   1   I one hugged Dave Grohl when the Foo Fighters played a secret gig at a small venue in Sydney - amazeballs.
336   1   I love, love, love Ryan Adams and get really usept when people make Bryan Adams jokes about them being the same person.
336   0   They&apos;re sooooooo different.
336   0   As you can see I&apos;m a bit sensistive about it
336   0   I still don&apos;t know what I want to be when I grow up
338   0   I finished reading Book 3 of A Song of Ice and Fire.

340   0   Thanks for sharing your experiences with professional help, awkwardturtle.
340   0   I&apos;m glad things are going well with it at the moment.
340   0   Those are some good points
344   0   Deciding when to have sex for the first time is not an easy decision.
344   0   When is the right time?
344   0   It&apos;s really important to feel safe with your partner and talk about this - they&apos;ll probably be wondering about it too!
344   0   The right time&apos; is different for everyone - and that&apos;s okay.
344   0   Some people want to have sex while they&apos;re in their &apos;teens while others prefer to wait until marriage.
344   0   It&apos;s really important to figure out why you want to have sex in the first place - is it for the pleasure or because you&apos;re curious or because it feels right or because you feel pressured to? Or a mix?
344   0   You also need to consider whether you feel emotionally ready and - if you think you are - be sure to sort out contraception!
344   0   If you think your partner has had sex before make sure they get an STI check as well *just in case*
346   0   I don&apos;t know about you but I always found the resume writing the hardest part of the job search.
346   0   So many organsations have different expectations and requirements for resumes that it just gets confusing.
346   0   How much infomation do you list down?
346   0   What contact information do I need?
346   0   Have I got too many pages?
346   1   The University Career Centero helped me write my resume and I wanted to share this with all of you.
346   0   They have a list of tips and tricks to resume writing that can help guide you through this process.
350   0   I&apos;ve been recently doing this.
350   0   It takes a while for it to sink in but it works!
350   0   I&apos;ve also been thinking of 2 reasons each day for why I love and are thankful for my family, boyfriend, friends
354   1   Coldrock will always make me smile, no matter how crappy my day has been.
354   1   I am the shortest person in my family, and I am 6ft.
354   0   I sit on the fence when choosing between cats and dogs.
354   0   Do I really have to pick a side?
354   1   I&apos;m a reality TV show addict.
354   0   I quote The Simpsons everyday because it lightens and brightens the day.
368   0   Hey gang!
368   0   Welcome to day 2!!
368   0   We&apos;re keen to hear from you what you think about our roles/ranking.
368   0   As you visit more, post more and get more kudos you will move up through the ranks
368   0   But we also have other roles for out moderators:
368   0   Moderators who back up the Community Managers after hours
368   0   Peer support moderators, young people who volunteer to help develop the community and keep it safe and supportive.
368   0   Staff who work for Inspire on ReachOut.
368   0   Members who end up being the most dedicated and passionate members of our community (even more than a Uber Contributor)
368   0   Professionals (such as a psychologist or youth worker) and celebrity special guests
368   0   Young people who have volunteered on different projects, help us make ReachOut.com better and represent us out in the community.
368   0   So, what do you think??
368   0   I&apos;m specifically keen to hear what you think about Mod Squad and Cheer Squad... Love it? Hate it? Why/why not?
372   0   How far do you think you could count to in a week???
374   0   Just tossing around some words, maybe it will inspire an idea in someone else
376   0   I love the idea of names and Mod Squad is good, but I don&apos;t think &apos;cheer squad&apos; really portrays what they are.
376   0   I&apos;m not sure what to suggest otherwise though...
382   0   So, this topic is something we&apos;ve all probably thought about at one point or another.
382   0   Whether or not we&apos;ve had to make decisions on what type of contraceptives to try, it&apos;s handy to know that there&apos;s plenty of information out there on what&apos;s available, as well as what the options are if something doesn&apos;t go as planned.
382   0   I knew someone who became pregnant during high school, and I always admired her strength in attending school while she was pregnant.
382   0   That&apos;s really the extent of my experience with the topic, other than getting to learn about contraceptives during PDH at school...
382   0   But I think it&apos;s really important to keep informed about what contraceptive options there are, and about the things that could happen if you or someone you know becomes pregnant.
382   0   So I was wondering if anyone else had experiences that they&apos;d like to share here..?
382   0   As far as tips go, my first suggestion would be: Find out as much as you can about the type of contraceptive you&apos;re thinking of using, including how to use it, effectiveness, what it protects against, and any possible side effects
382   0   (And make sure that the information comes from a trusted source - this could be a factsheet on RO, a health professional, the box/packaging for the contraceptive etc... While there&apos;s lots of stuff on the internet and all kinds of rumours, it&apos;s safest to check the facts!)
386   0   I love the idea, but I&apos;m not sure on cheer squad
386   0   Cheer Battalion, Salute Squad, Salute Force, Buoyancy Brigade, Huzzah Guides, Applauding Assemblage - Just tossing around some words, maybe it will inspire an idea in someone else
386   0   love your brain storm snowflake!!!
386   0   Huzzah Guides is probably my fav!! And Bouyancy brigade!
386   0   Yr totally thinking on the right track...
386   0   Lets keep thinking along this track...
386   0   We&apos;ll get somewhere AWESOME... anyone else got some ideas?
388   0   I always find this to be a tough part of job hunting too.
388   0   Thanks for the link!
388   0   I know that one of the DO&apos;s Customize for individual readers (when advantageous) - has actually helped me to feel more confident about the skills I had that could translate into the job I was trying to apply for.
388   0   My original resume was just generic, stating random things that I&apos;d done...
388   0   I started making it a bit more specific when applying for professional roles, matching my experiences with what the job details ask for.
388   1   Then, I wanted to apply for a job in retail.
