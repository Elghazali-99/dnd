oicu812abc@   1   From the time our relationship became serious when we were 21 years of age (we are in our 50s now) my then-girlfriend, then-fiancee, and now wife has often verbally assailed me in front of others in an extreme manner.
oicu812abc@   1   Each time this occurs she uses the exact same wording as before, her body language is the same and the look of absolute hate on her face is the most disturbing of all.
oicu812abc@   1   Her outbursts have nothing to do with a monthly cycle or menopause.
oicu812abc@   1   I have tried confronting her about this after she has calmed down from about 5 minutes after the event to 24 hours after the event and the results are the same: A few seconds (literally about 10 seconds maximum) of listening to me followed by another screaming fit of denying any of it happened at all.
oicu812abc@   1   This woman is NOT a liar.
oicu812abc@   1   She does not lie.
oicu812abc@   1   She really believes she did not pitch these fits.
oicu812abc@   1   Her dad pitches fits like this to his wife as well.
oicu812abc@   0   To show the magnitude of this problem an example is given:
oicu812abc@   0   Wife and I were at a large grocery store in our hometown when she encountered a fried of hers that I did not know.
oicu812abc@   0   After standing quietly at her side for about a minute I decided to introduce myself at a lull in their conversation.
oicu812abc@   0   I never got the opportunity.
oicu812abc@   1   The wife observed me drawing a breath to say something and her favorite tirade spewed from her mouth at about 95decibels. "I'm independent!" I don't need anybody, especially YEEEOOOOOUUUUU ! (wagging finger in my face during the long pronunciation of the word 'you')
oicu812abc@   0   If you ever do anything to come between me and my independence you'll get your what-for ! "
oicu812abc@   0   I still do not know who that woman 'we' met at the store was.
oicu812abc@   0   At the end of the tirade I turned and went to wait for her in the car.
oicu812abc@   0   It was at most 5 minutes later my wife came to the car angry with me at leaving her alone in the store (independence, anyone?) and professing no knowledge of her outburst.
oicu812abc@   0   Literally screamed at me that she did no such thing and that she was not screaming at me while she was screaming at me in the car.
oicu812abc@   0   There are many other topics she screams about and if someone in a group brings up anything remotely related to these topics she often goes on one of her tirades.
oicu812abc@   1   Her dad is like this too.
oicu812abc@   0   What's the source of this behavior?
oicu812abc@   1   She needs help, big time.  And So Do I.
oicu812abc@   1   I love this woman and she is normally quite sweet and loving but this has to stop.
oicu812abc@   1   Either by her overcoming her problem or separation.
oicu812abc@   0   Please Help.

nannygoat50@   1   My husband has always spouted off at the mouth and said horrible things.
nannygoat50@   0   Here is the new situation.
nannygoat50@   1   He took a job in Sept. in another state,  and I still live in TX.
nannygoat50@   1   I am supposed to meet him in Illinois after the new year due to a lease we still have.
nannygoat50@   1   He has also moved us from MI, to OK, to TX, and now IL in less than 2 years!
nannygoat50@   0   I thought it best to stay at our apt. in TX in case the job in IL didn't work out he would have a place where there are more job opportunities.
nannygoat50@   1   He has hated us being apart, but treats me horrible!
nannygoat50@   1   He has gotten mad every weekend since he left and this is what he does.
nannygoat50@   1   First he will get mad about something little while talking to me on the phone.
nannygoat50@   1   Then he will hang up on me and unplug the phone for the whole weekend and I can't get ahold of him.
nannygoat50@   1   Then he will type me many nasty e-mails and bring up all kinds of things in our past and stuff he knows about me that happened even before we met.
nannygoat50@   1   He threatens to leave me, drop my insurance, leave me on the street, etc.
nannygoat50@   1   He got mad last night cause we were talking about Christmas.
nannygoat50@   0   I told him that I hoped that we didn't do what we did last year and go overboard on spending.
nannygoat50@   1   We spent over 3000.00 on the credit cards for gifts, mainly to his daughters.
nannygoat50@   1   He got so mad about that he started pushing the buttons on the phone over and over so I couldn't talk.
nannygoat50@   1   Then he said it was His money and I don't help out at all and he could do what he wanted with His money!
nannygoat50@   0   He said he had to go and didn't want to talk about it.
nannygoat50@   1   He unplugged his phone and still hasn't plugged it back in this morning.
nannygoat50@   0   I'm sure he won't either.
nannygoat50@   1   I'm sure he would write me some awful e-mail that I would be afraid to open, except that he destroyed his laptop computer last week when I was in IL visiting.
nannygoat50@   1   He got mad at me cause I wasn't excited enought about his plan to buy a new 24" screen for it.
nannygoat50@   1   He told me that he hated being with me and that I suck the life out of him.
nannygoat50@   1   He threw his laptop down and stomped on it.
nannygoat50@   0   Now he doesn't even have a computer.
nannygoat50@   0   But he gets mad at me for spending any money and he destroys things right and left.
nannygoat50@   0   I am so confused about it all.
nannygoat50@   0   I keep thinking that if I just knew when to shutup, but when we are talking and things are going good, as they were last night, I let my guard down and feel like I can  speak freely.
nannygoat50@   0   Then BAM, he does it again!
nannygoat50@   0   I am a mess, a wreck.
nannygoat50@   1   I am 50 years old and don't have any real skills to get a great paying job like he does.
nannygoat50@   0   He could go on without me and do fine, but I could only make 8.00 an hour or so.
nannygoat50@   0   I just don't know what to do, but I'm dying here!
nannygoat50@   1   He calls me Eeyour ( the disney donkey) cause he says I am blah.
nannygoat50@   0   Well, I am blah now due to so much verbal ****.
nannygoat50@   0   I am scared and reduced to a nothing of a person.
nannygoat50@   0   Is it me or is he really abusive.
nannygoat50@   1   Usually after the weekend, I will call him at work and he will act like nothing ever happened.
nannygoat50@   0   Is this normal!
nannygoat50@   0   Help!
Liisa1@   0   I wonder if anyone knows of any groups for people abused by medical professionals.
Liisa1@   1   I am from Finland originally, but have also lived in the US and the UK for longer periods of time.
Liisa1@   1   I have now lived in Finland for the past year and before that I lived in Chicago.
Liisa1@   1   I was abused by a doctor at the Oulu University Hospital in Northern Finland when given too much fentanyl after falling off a horse and fracturing four ribs in January this year.
Liisa1@   1   I was nearly unconscious and a female doctor (ca 50 years old) asked me disgusting sexual questions in front of 9 people and provoked me to talk about sexual things nobody would ever discuss with any stranger, while I was heavily sedated.
Liisa1@   1   Nine people were watching and nobody intervened.
Liisa1@   1   Actually on the contrary, two older nurses (a male and a female) urged the female doctor to continue and I was abused even more.
Liisa1@   1   I have been truly traumatized by this and have been in trauma therapy for four months now.
Liisa1@   0   I wonder if you know of any support group or of any people with similar situation to mine that I could talk to.
Liisa1@   1   I have not received any proper therapy in Finland and a very unprofessional female psychiatrist just almost dismissed my case (6.2.2017) as I was not able to tell her much about what had happened.
Liisa1@   0   She pretty much just sent me home.
Liisa1@   0   The discussions "therapy" that I have received thus far has not helped at all.
Liisa1@   0   I am only given times once in two weeks and during the two week period I can get really down and cannot stop thinking about what happened and how badly I was treated.
Liisa1@   1   I know I have the symptoms of PTSD, but it seems that the staff giving me the "therapy" totally dismisses this and pretty much just thinks my abuse isn't such a big deal.
Liisa1@   0   Apparently to them the abuse was not that serious as there was no touching ( I have not been able to talk to them about the abuse details either).
Liisa1@   0   However, this kind of abuse by medical staff when you are totally helpless (I could not move and I remember that I was told to ...Breath,...Breath), thus I was in a really bad shape at some point, really leaves bad scars.
Liisa1@   0   The AJC magazine said it really well " Hurt that does not heal" *link removed*
Liisa1@   0   I know different people take this kind of abuse differently.
Liisa1@   1   I was brought up in a very traditional Christian home, thus this kind of sexual abuse when nearly unconscious leaves a lot greater scars compared with people having liberal upbringing.
Liisa1@   0   I have no objection to either upbringing, however, medical staff should take into consideration how badly their actions can hurt some people when others might pretty much just dismiss the case.
Liisa1@   0   And nobody regardless of their background should need to go through anything like this!!!
Liisa1@   0   I personally think anyone going through a thing like this would be hurt in some way.
Liisa1@   0   You are supposed to be able trust the people taking care of you when ever you fall ill.
Liisa1@   0   I would really appreciate any help that anyone could offer as I have noticed that I DO have the symptoms of PTSD and that the symptoms can be quite severe and have lasted for way too long.
Liisa1@   0   Talking to other people with similar experiences I am sure would be of great benefit.
Liisa1@   0   Hopefully you have time to get in touch
Liisa1@   1   Best Liisa
SouthernHere@   0   Hello.
SouthernHere@   0   I have thought about this a long time, never told anyone, as I am not sure if this constitutes abuse or not.
SouthernHere@   1   I am a female on my thirties now.
SouthernHere@   1   When I was about 9 or 10 years old, one night I was watching TV with my dad at my parent`s bedroom, just the two of us.
SouthernHere@   1   I don`t remember whether I was shirtless or just with my t-shirt held up, but I remember him touching my chest  (not developed  still) and nipples in circles, slowly all the way around my nipples.
SouthernHere@   0   In one point my mother showed and was about to enter the room, and he stopped.
SouthernHere@   0   I hate to say this, but I also remember I kinda liked enjoyed him doing that.
SouthernHere@   0   I`m sorry.
SouthernHere@   0   I do not remember him going to my genital area.
SouthernHere@   0   Does this still constitute sexual abuse, or not?
SouthernHere@   0   Thank you for reading this.
SouthernHere@   0   I have never told anyone about this.
BethAnn_95@   0   Abuse or Relationship Issues?
BethAnn_95@   1   My boyfriend and I have been togeather for a year.
BethAnn_95@   0   Like any relationship we have had minor issues & disagreements but have always worked them out and in the process our relationship has gotten stronger and is wonderful, until most recently.
BethAnn_95@   1   A months ago I found out I was pregnant, I was taking birth control and it was 100% not planned or desired to have a baby at this point in my life.
BethAnn_95@   1   We decided to keep the baby and make it a positive and happy thing, we are both excited.
BethAnn_95@   1   My boyfriend has been supportive about the baby and we are in the process of buying a house.
BethAnn_95@   1   So here is the issues: Last month my boyfriend & I were on a weekend get away, he got entirely too drunk at dinner and began acting very rude and loud.
BethAnn_95@   0   I left the restaurant and walked back to the hotel to avoid an embarrassing scene, this sent him into a rage and he came to the hotel room screaming, calling me awful names saying horrible things and it escalated to the point he shoved me on the bed and pushed the back of my neck/head into the mattress.
BethAnn_95@   0   I left the hotel room for a few hours and came back to him sleeping.
BethAnn_95@   0   It was a horrible fight and it left me heart broken.
BethAnn_95@   0   We discussed what happened the next day and he was extreamly emotional and sorry for what he had done and promised me he would never drink like that or lay hands on me again.
BethAnn_95@   0   Because I'm carring his child and I want our baby to have a mom and dad that are togeather, we've worked it out.
BethAnn_95@   1   I'm now 3 almost 4 months pregnant and I recently discovered some online activity of his that had disturbed me/hurt me deeply.
BethAnn_95@   1   Porn, dating websites (he signed up for but has not used) and a tumblr account where he was liking naked pictures, masturbating videos and inappropriate posts of a girl we both mutually know.
BethAnn_95@   1   Also he also adds a lot of girls on social media and a few other super annoying/disrespectful things that really bug me.
BethAnn_95@   0   I confronted him about the things I saw and found out, he was sorry but I didn't feel genuine remourse for it and I'm completely devastated by what I saw and I can't get over it.
BethAnn_95@   1   Fast forward two days and we are having our gender reveal party, he had too much to drink and went to sleep in our bed, his phone was going off and I looked, it was the girl who he had been following on tumblr calling him???
BethAnn_95@   1   I woke him up and asked why she was calling and he got so angry he again choked me out severely for a long time, I hit his face a few times and kicked him only to get him off of me and I left the room and went out to the car.
BethAnn_95@   1   I called his mother to come pick him up and stayed in my car until she arrived.
BethAnn_95@   0   He was banging on my car window and screaming and crying to let him in and he was sorry.
BethAnn_95@   0   I didn't open the door.
BethAnn_95@   1   My neck was sore and there were faint bruises.
BethAnn_95@   1   We live together and he is SO sorry but I fear it will all happen again in the future under the right circumstances, the physical and the cheating.
BethAnn_95@   0   Fast forward a week and he's acting like nothing ever happened and he want things to be normal.
BethAnn_95@   0   I can't do that.
BethAnn_95@   0   I need something to help me move past all this.
BethAnn_95@   0   Between the stuff I found online which I consider cheatig and the physical situation I'm drained and unhappy.
BethAnn_95@   1   We're not sexual any longer (my decision) and I'm confused emotionally....
BethAnn_95@   0   is this something that can be worked out through counseling with a relationship therapist or should I end the relationship???
BethAnn_95@   0   I love him but I know my judgment is off right now, I need help.
BethAnn_95@   1   I just want what is best for my baby girl and myself.
BethAnn_95@   0   Aside from these issues our relationship is really great and I love him dearly, he's a great lover and friend (it sound crazy and stupid to say but it makes me so unsure of what is right)
BethAnn_95@   0   I keep wanting to get to a good place again, have our baby and be a happy family.
BethAnn_95@   0   Am I completely stupid or is it obtainable?
BethAnn_95@   0   Help me do the right and smart thing for all involved!
Tucker4275@   1   I've recently started seeing a man who lives with his 18 yr old daughter.
Tucker4275@   1   They seem more like a married couple than anything else and it's begun to concern me.
Tucker4275@   1   Especially when the other night after making love he & I got on the topic of 3soms and he said he'd had one once at the house.
Tucker4275@   1   For some reason I asked where his daughter was at the time and he said, with a straight face, "she was there too".
Tucker4275@   0   When my eyes widened and I said "what?!" he paused a bit too long then smiled and said she was gone, out.
Tucker4275@   0   But there was something about the way he said it that made me believe he was telling me the encounter was with her (and one of her friends?)...
Tucker4275@   0   That he'd been testing my reaction.
Tucker4275@   0   Especially since in the past he has answered things in much the same way only to act like it was a joke;
Tucker4275@   0   but more often than not I find his "joke" answers are the truth - he always admits them later.
Tucker4275@   1   He & his daughter are very very close.
Tucker4275@   0   She acts like his wife.
Tucker4275@   1   Always calling to see when he'll be home.
Tucker4275@   1   It makes me uncomfortable although she doesn't seem to have any problem with our relationship.
Tucker4275@   0   It's strange.
Tucker4275@   0   Lately I wonder if I imagine it all or if they are sexual or have been in the past.
Tucker4275@   0   Something about the way they interact screams "relationship" - although they are careful not to be too physical around me.
Tucker4275@   0   What signs of incest should I be looking for?
Tucker4275@   0   Is there anything telltail that will confirm my assumptions?
Tucker4275@   0   Why would anyone mention their daughter when talking about who a sexual encounter was with?
Tucker4275@   0   Isn't this odd?
Tucker4275@   0   I don't want to find problems where there are none but don't want to be in this if it is what I fear.
Tucker4275@   0   I'm afraid I already love him so even putting this out there is hard & seems like a betrayal.
Tucker4275@   0   I just don't know if I should trust my instincts or not.
Tucker4275@   0   Maybe I am paranoid??
Tucker4275@   0   Any advice is appreciated.
Bunnyrose1203@   1   My step father spent the last year molesting me constantly.
Bunnyrose1203@   1   The last day he did so he told me he wanted to have sex with me analy (I was raped this way) upon doing so all the memories of my rape were brought back and I developed a sever PTSD disorder.
Bunnyrose1203@   1   I was going to end my life that night but decided to tell my mother what was happening instead.
Bunnyrose1203@   1   At first she was willing to help me but then reverted and decided she didn't believe me.
Bunnyrose1203@   1   She wanted me to live with the man who had molested me constantly FOR A YEAR.
Bunnyrose1203@   1   She never supported me through the entire investigation and both of them working together and using my mentality against me had the investigation closed.
Bunnyrose1203@   0   I got no justification and she still loves the man.
Bunnyrose1203@   0   What do I do?

firedsand@   0   Hi folks,
firedsand@   1   I am under the care of a physician and prescribed currently Trintellix 10mg qhs, Vyvanse 50mg qam, Alprazolam 0.5mg prn, Zolpidem 10mg qhs prn
firedsand@   1   She changed the Vyvanse from Adderrall 20mg qam, 10mg afternoon as needed.
firedsand@   1   She changed to Trintellix first from Fetzima 40mg, then Bupropion xr 300mg.
firedsand@   1   Random screen at work read crazy high levels of amphetamines in urine, like <15,000 ng/ml.
firedsand@   1   Saliva level was barely detected, hair after demanding some form of quantification came back negative for everything!
firedsand@   0   Took a battle and a half with multiple med changes and my name is cleared but I feel damage was done.
firedsand@   0   I don't abuse anything, ever.
firedsand@   1   Urine was done by Quest diagnostics.
firedsand@   0   Asked the guy that takes the results to do more in depth testing but he essentially just swore I'm abusing medication on reports.
firedsand@   1   He is not a MRO or even an M.D.. But a PA at Medac.
firedsand@   0   When confronted he was rightly petrified due to liability.
firedsand@   1   My doctor changed Fetzima and then wellbutrin as she states they can throw off amphetamine levels in emit testing.
firedsand@   1   Medac guy swore they used gcms to validate.
firedsand@   0   So my doctor would run tests the same day I went to Medac.
firedsand@   1   Levels never matched up though both labs use samsha guidelines supposedly.
firedsand@   0   What in the world?!
firedsand@   0   Help me here.
firedsand@   1   Most days I take niacin, b50 complex, vitamin c and probiotics.
firedsand@   1   Occasionally ibu or naproxen.
firedsand@   0   NOTHING else ever, and never in excess of prescribed dosage.
firedsand@   1   I tend to have leftovers at end of each month as I don't take ADHD meds every weekend.
firedsand@   0   Once my medication changed I read below cutoff at both labs thus "negative" but I've spent a fortune clearing my name and throwing out other prescriptions just to buy something else.
firedsand@   0   I'm angry and seething.
firedsand@   1   I have a good career complete with student loan debt, I have 3 kids and this really messed with about 7 weeks of my life.
firedsand@   0   So why would urine read absurdly high, saliva no and hair negative?
firedsand@   0   No hair dye, no bleach no nonsense.
firedsand@   1   Natural dark red hair now chock full of more gray..
firedsand@   1   120 pounds
firedsand@   1   40 years old
firedsand@   1   5'6".
firedsand@   0   Help!
mamacodi@   1   My son is five years old.
mamacodi@   1   He was recently moved from Concerta 36mg once a day to Focalin XR 10mg twice a day but still takes Concerta .01mg at night.
mamacodi@   1   He is still rapidly blinking his eyes and his pupils are still dialated.
mamacodi@   0   Is this normal?
mamacodi@   0   If not does anyone have any advice?
triedeverymed@   1   I am a 41 yr. old ffemale who was put on Vyanse to help with my focus and concentration.
triedeverymed@   1   I have been on Vyvanse for 1 1/2 months.
triedeverymed@   1   The original dose wa 30mg. but I didn't see a difference so I was upped to 70mg. 2 weeks ago.
triedeverymed@   0   The past week I have felt very unmotivated to do anything.
triedeverymed@   0   I don't even want to talk to my friends, I just feel like being alone all the time.
triedeverymed@   0   This is partially what I went on the drug to get rid of but it's making it worse.
triedeverymed@   0   Has anyone else had a bad reaction to Vyvanse, if so what was it and how did you resolve it?
triedeverymed@   0   I'm going to ask my doc if the dose it too high.
triedeverymed@   0   Has anyone else had unwanted side effects from too high of a dose?
triedeverymed@   0   Any experience with Vyanse good or bad would be appreciated.
triedeverymed@   0   Thanks so much for your help, as always!!
triedeverymed@   1   Erin
PerpetualVillage@   1   I'm considering taking my child to Learning Technics (www.learningtechnics.com)
PerpetualVillage@   1   They said the use "specifically target neurological activities" to improve a child's attention and focus.
PerpetualVillage@   0   I have heard of brain training and cognitive enhancement...has anybody heard of this company?
PerpetualVillage@   0   I don't want to put my child on medication.
PerpetualVillage@   0   I would prefering trying a natural non-evahsive remedy first.
PerpetualVillage@   1   I also heard of another company in Canada called Easton School...any info on the subject would really help!
PerpetualVillage@   0   Thanks
carriec174@   1   Hi all, today I obtained a new script for 20mg of Vyvanse (a switch from Adderall XR).
carriec174@   1   I got it filled at CVS, and having read accounts of tampering, I checked out the capsules and noticed their contents are low, and significantly varied.
carriec174@   1   Most of the capsules are only HALF full, and none of them are entirely full.
carriec174@   0   I'll also note that I picked the script up myself, and kept them in a secure place until I opened them.
carriec174@   0   I assumed they wouldn't be vacuum packed but the amount free space looks strikingly redundant.
carriec174@   0   I tried calling both the pharmacy and Shire, only to get the runaround.
carriec174@   1   CVS said that the pills are delivered pre-assembled, and Shire gave a lecture about "natural settling" and FDA enforced measurement uniformity.
carriec174@   1   My instincts tell me that somebody opened the capsules, took half of the drugs out, and will dispense or use them at their hearts dictates--scot-free.
carriec174@   0   Because who's to say I didn't alter them myself?
carriec174@   0   After all, it's a "controlled substance" user's word against a drug company and or giant pharmacy chain.
carriec174@   0   Anyone take these?
carriec174@   0   Is it normal for the caps to be half full?
carriec174@   0   I hope I'm wrong on this one.

michaelaxx@   1   I was prescribed Concerta 18mg by a psychiatrist.
michaelaxx@   1   I am currently studying for the bar exam and have been taking one pill everyday (since May 17th).
michaelaxx@   1   The bar exam is on July 24th-26th, 2017.
michaelaxx@   1   I have never taken Concerta everyday for this long before, and I know that daily use is not encouraged.
michaelaxx@   0   However, I feel that taking it daily would allow me to prepare for the exam to the best of my ability.
michaelaxx@   0   The amount of information I need to learn is substantial, as is the difference in my ability to study for long hours on and off the medicine.
michaelaxx@   1   While I cannot find any online information that tells me that taking Concerta daily for 2 months is unsafe, I would welcome a second opinion before I continue the way I have.
michaelaxx@   1   Aside from a bit of anxiety (which could be due to PMS and the test), I do not feel any side effects.
michaelaxx@   0   I have been sleeping and eating well.
michaelaxx@   1   After taking a break from Concerta in the past, I have experienced irritability, sadness, and moodiness (which also could have been due to PMS given the timing of the symptoms; I've always had unpleasant PMS).
michaelaxx@   0   Any recommendations for managing these (potential) aftereffects are welcome, too.
michaelaxx@   0   Sorry if this is a rookie question or if has been answered...
michaelaxx@   1   again, I'm pretty new to this and I'm studying for the bar. :)
kitkat4416@   1   hey guys this is my fourth day taking vyvanse and i heard when the first month is over the euphoria is over.
kitkat4416@   0   how bad is it after the euphoria is gone?
Miss_Christine@   0   Hi there - to whomever stumbles upon this lil query of mine.
Miss_Christine@   0   Any thoughtful responses back would be wonderfully appreciated:)
Miss_Christine@   1   My question is this:  Why is it that my pupils become so extremely dilated after just a few hours of taking my daily morning dosage of one 20MG Adderall XR and one or two 5MG Adderall (Immediate Release) tablets???!!!!
Miss_Christine@   0   It is terribly embarrassing to look anyone in the eye now.
Miss_Christine@   0   I never used to feel so self-conscious about my appearance & social acceptance/perception, etc..
Miss_Christine@   0   It's like this drug is has turned me into walking & talking oxymoron of a person.
Miss_Christine@   1   On the one hand, Adderall gives me this great sense of happiness & well-being.
Miss_Christine@   0   I want to take on everything.
Miss_Christine@   1   I get to the gym, I keep my apartment clean & tidy, I have this inner strength of confidence & motivation/drive, all of which, I never really had before starting this medication.
Miss_Christine@   1   Then on the flip-side, after people started commenting to me about how huge my pupils were, I began to take notice myself.
Miss_Christine@   1   Every day, as I put make-up on, washed my face, brushed my teeth - there in the mirror was this beautiful young woman but her once green & lively, bright eyes were simply gone.
Miss_Christine@   0   I looked exactly as a friend once described - 'lost, sad, empty - that deer in the headlights' appearance.
Miss_Christine@   0   It breaks my heart that inside I feel alive again, more like the true me but now because of these damn dilated pupils - people seem more weary of me and possibly, almost frightened of me?
Miss_Christine@   0   I dunno, I just don't know what to do.
Miss_Christine@   0   I'm here.
Miss_Christine@   0   I feel that I am here and alive and doing my best to overcome life's challenges with a sunny disposition.
Miss_Christine@   0   My eyes though, they have always given me away; just now it seems as if  they're giving away somebody else.... someone I feel completely stranger to.
Miss_Christine@   0   I know this may seem ludicrous & narcissistic to many of you, but truly, eyes are important in life! ...
Miss_Christine@   0   So somebody help me out here please, why do they dilate so much, why doesn't this happen to anyone else I've ever known who has been prescribed an ADHD medication,
Miss_Christine@   1   why does it also happen when I take a medication like Xanax.... is my only option to go off the Adderall or start wearing a pair of colored contact lenses?
Miss_Christine@   0   ugh.... enough, said.  It just *****.
Miss_Christine@   0   Thanks for any help or kind words of advice:)
Miss_Christine@   1   P.S.  Granted I am also taking one Cymbalta 60mg capsule daily, as well as one Xanax 2MG in the late afternoon if needed, and, at bedtime, two Ambien CR - or there's no way I will fall asleep until at the earliest: 5am.
