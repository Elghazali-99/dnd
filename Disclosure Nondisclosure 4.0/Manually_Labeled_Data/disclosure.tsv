1	Stayed on the very top floor and were surprised by a Jacuzzi bath we did n't know we were getting
1	Det som drog ner betyget var att vi fick ett rum under taksarna dr det endast var full sthjd i 80 av rummets yta
1	We stayed here for four nights in October
1	Plenty of choice for breakfastSpa at hotel nearby which we used while we were there
1	We stayed here for four nights in October
1	Plenty of choice for breakfastSpa at hotel nearby which we used while we were there
1	We loved staying on the island of Lido
1	You need to take a water is from Venice to get there
1	It was ok hotel is nice from in and out but room was small we paid for double bed bat they atteched 2 single bed
1	My wife and I had a room with a terrace over looking the waterit was a great view
1	I will look to stay at this hotel my next time in Venicevery pleased
1	If you placed your head in the skylight on the other side you might able sit up
1	We moved to the 1st floor the next day and within minutes found a centipede on the wall and15 flies
1	Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs
1	We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem
1	That night we spent 2 hrs catching 6 centipedes in our room
1	We asked reception for a new room or hotel but there supposedly were n't any hotels with open rooms and if we wanted leave we would have to pay for transportation and both hotels
1	The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem
1	We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they did n't put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it
1	She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen , so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war
1	Adding , a few euros is n't going to make anything go away so we should just go enjoy the day because more we talk the less time we have
1	The dcor of the room was pleasant and flawless , unlike many of the Venice hotels I 've stayed in
1	We did n't find this a problem at all   we knew this was going to be the case so had prebooked transport tickets to save money
1	In conclusion , I would book this again due to the fantastic quality of the hotel , despite the tradeoff of not being in Venice itself
1	Obwohl unser Zimmer i m Erdgeschoss zur Nebenstrae hin lag , war es dort sehr ruhig
1	Wir wurden sehr freundlich empfangen , berhaupt war das Personal i m Hotel sehr nett und hilfsbereit
1	Located on the Lido I would recommend this hotel if you require a little piece and quiet after the busy day 's in Venice , facility 's good , staff very friendly and very helpful
1	I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wife 's special birthday 's , and yes they ordered exactly as requested , ca n't ask for more
1	We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable
1	All in all we had a great time in Venice , it can be a little expensive so do n't ponder over the bills to much , just pay up with a smile
1	Einzig was zu bemengeln ist Fernsehen kann man nur zwei Programe , aber das ist i m Urlaub nicht so wichtig
1	We received excellent service   many thanks to Anna and Donnatella who made us feel at home
1	Havde 7 overnatninger i april 2015 p Hotel Russo Palace p Lidoen i Venedig
1	If we wanted to stay on the Lido again , this would be a good option , but next time I think we 'll opt for a place closer to the action
1	Econmy rooms have sloping roof so tall guests mind your head We stayed in one and it was fine , the occational bump but for the price you ca nt really complain
1	Hotel has pleasant views and is about ten minute walk to main water bus terminal to take you any direction
1	We used the spa one day
1	Close to Venice and decent hotel , breakfast was okay with no too much selection but has everything you need
1	Staff were so helpful , especially Ivan and the lady we met on the desk each morning
1	We booked two nights at Russo hotel on Lido strip and two nights in the very center of Venice
1	We did n't see it on the hotel description but they offered us a taxi boat ride to Murano with another couple for free

1	You had to drive into town but they said that Uber is available if you need it
1	This was our first visit to Palm Springs and hopefully not our last
1	We were in Palm Springs on the day the temperature was 123 degrees
1	Despite that , we had a wonderful stay because of the Little Paradise hotel
1	We arrived in Palm Springs not sure what to expectit 's a quiet kinda place in ' low season'we drove down what appeared to be a residential streetparked up at a wooden gate and were n't sure what to expect
1	Saltwater pool , fresh fruit , BEST showerhead I 've ever experienced , I can go on and on
1	I would definately recommend this place to anyone visiting or passing trough Palm Springs
1	They provide some breakfast items , snacks and bottles of spring water
1	You can bring in anything you like to enjoy at the pool or in your room
1	I 'd also like to add the wonderful service you will find here with Victor and staff who seem to want to do anything and everything to make you happy
1	We went for a relaxing weekend as an offshoot of a family visit
1	We were on a business trip to Anaheim and , afterwards , drove to Palm Springs for a relaxing weekend
1	Victor and Judy were truly accommodating hosts , especially when we had to cut our stay short due to illness
1	Spend four days there and would have prolonged our stay if they only had a room available
1	I 'm going to keep this fairly short but what I will say is if you are going to stay in Palm Springs please stay here
1	We had unit 4 on the east side of the complex for 3 nights   very quiet , very comfortable bed , nice amenities in room   killer shower
1	pool was large , heated , wonderful   Judy hope I got that right made us fresh orange and banana smoothies when we were in the pool   breakfast in fridge was just ok , little More

1	If you are being treated at any Texas Medical Center facility this is a good place to stay
1	They have a free shuttle service , but it is not accessible to wheelchair users , and they do n't care
1	I emailed the corporate customer care email address and they take unreasonable amounts of time to respond to emails and do not remedy the problem
1	We went to an Astros game and the drive was about 18 minutes
1	We went to the Johnson Space Center the next day More
1	Our room , while quite large we had an accessible room , had two ACs that did not dehumidify the room
1	I am glad to report that on our most recent trip the internet worked great and the breakfast was much improved
1	When you go to Texas for cancer treatment , the little things become big things
1	I was a bit concerned after checking the rating of this hotel , but was so pleasantly surprised when I got there
1	I was basically there for a medical visit and it seemed like so were a lot of other people , but we would totally stay there if we were just visiting Houston
1	My mom checked in for me since I More
1	We stay here each time my husband has a medical appt in Houston and they do offer medical rates if you ask
1	When i talked to the front desk to make a complaint and get the front desk to give me the corporate information she gave me a cell phone number instead of the corporate office
1	I have been staying here , off and on , four about 7 years
1	The first time was when my father was going thru treatment at MD Anderson
1	The staff were great , made accommodations for him and also for his caregivers
1	I have also stayed there during my pre More
1	We stayed here because of a family medical emergencyDid not have any options for a room
1	to share your opinion of this businesswith YP visitors across the United Statesand in your neighborhood
1	I would have left , had I not already had a reservation through Hotelscom
1	We were told we had one of the best rooms , besides staring at cargo containers , the TV would not work so they changed our room
1	The did n't tell me they were gon na run my credit card for accidental for a 100 charge
1	They just told me they had to double check my ID and the credit card that was used
1	This is a must stay and if I 'm in need of a hotel in the Livermore area , this is the place to stay
1	When I lay down on the bed , all I could smell was dirty old sweat socks
1	I do n't think they ever used detergent or fabric softener to wash the linensThey were that horrible
1	I had to spray the linens with perfume so I would n't smell them ' au naturel ' while I 'm sleeping
1	Nice place no complaints , one thing they did n't tell me , is they put a 100 hold on your card that stays for a couple days after you check out
1	I know this is not rare but any place that does has told me
1	The breakfast in morning was pretty good , they had a full buffet not just some pakage pastries
1	Great stay for our night downtown Livermore at Bankhead Theater concert
1	Nice patio where we spent our morning catching up
1	Perfect for my family to relax for the Easter weekend and for my girlfriend 's Livermore 12 marathon
1	Having never been to Livermore , imagine my shock when the 2nd floor balcony room overlooked a parking lot and a gas station with a Jack in the Box thrown in for good measure
1	I thought I was staying in wine country
1	Granted I should have done more research but it was a last minute decision to go
1	My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here
1	When we asked the desk clerk about this , she pointed her finger toward the door and said , It 's about 4 miles that way
1	We had a great view of Jack in the Box parking lot
1	When we first entered our room and kicked off our shoes , we found ourselves stepping on numerous sand burrs left on the carpet
1	After working out and returning to our room at 9 am , there was no hot water for the shower
1	Only problem we had was that we were not informed of the teen basketball tournament going on in the city
1	We went to the lobby for our full breakfast at 1015 and there was nothing left
1	We pickup a beagle and coffee and went to our room
1	We could n't get the heater on easily for some reason but then when the heat temperature finally came on we were sweating in the middle of the night
1	Let 's face it , this is NOT in the Livermore ' wine country'you can throw a rock from your room to busy InterState 580 and never come close to a vine or vineyard
1	they paid for the ice I purached
1	I must say the GM at this hotel Catherine is the bomb
1	I would stay here every time I 'm in California
1	The hotel was great , but the Buffet Breakfast was the worst I have ever had
1	While they are currently going through a renovation , which I think will be really nice once it is completed , we rarely had any indication of the ongoing construction activities
1	My family stated the place was nice as they were here for my wedding
1	I have to say I was impressed
1	I had spoke with her earlier before arriving and she was great on the phone and she was so sweet at check in
1	We are use to staying at expensive four star hotels but needed to complete a quick business trip and we were so delighted with this hotel
1	We were in town for a family event so we did n't do much exploring , but there seemed to be many amenities right in the area
1	The most convenient place to stay in Livermor and where we will stay in the future
1	We were in Livermore for a twoday stay , and it was a nice quiet retreat in the midst of family chaos
1	There 's nothing wrong with the hotel except that there are flood lights shining in your window while you sleep and the curtains do n't close
1	Our room was not clean enough   I found a floss stick on the table in our room
1	Evidently they have regular wine Thursdays here
1	I requested a wakeup call , they did n't do it
1	When I made reservations at this hotel , I had average expectations at that that price rate for that area
1	However the newly renovated room , the professional staff and the cleanliness and the comfort of really surprised me and I will definitely go back
1	We stayed for two nights
1	The last time I stayed at this hotel , it was under remodeling and one of the rooms I was placed in had a heating unit that did not work
1	This time , my granddaughter and I checked in at about 430 pm and the room was extremely More
1	From making our reservation to our time spent , the Hawthorn in Livermore was really nice
1	I did have to find the direct phone number to get assurance our needs would be met as the central hotel reservation system is simply not equipped to handle any details
1	I work in Livermore and stayed the night to celebrate with friends
1	My boyfriend and I were very pleased with the accommodations , the room was clean and large
1	I live somewhat local in Redwood City , but it 's far enough away that after spending the evening with High School Friends , having a 30th gathering was n't an official reunion , at a local beer pub , we did n't want to chance driving home after having a few beers
1	We made the reservation Friday night , and honestly , was apprehensive because of some of the reviews
1	The bathroom tub could use an updatebut I have stayed in the W in downtown Chicago and the tub was worse and room was horrible
1	I 'd take this room over that one any day
1	But the coffee was decent and overall , was very pleased with our last minute choice to stay therewould do it again and would recommend others
1	We booked this hotel because we had a wedding
1	I was at the hotel for a wedding and all of the staff , Catherine in particular , were incredibly helpful and accommodating
1	They were remodeling the dining area during our stay but it did n't bother us too much More
1	Our family reserved 6 rooms for 24 days for a family event
1	Our daughter turned her refrigerator on upon check in and then stocked it with food
1	The front desk staff was fine , but I thought they could 've been a more friendly and welcoming
1	Our Hotel was conveniently located very close to everything we wanted to do
1	When i awoke in the am since I arrived so late and did not notice I flipped the covers off and there was dried blood on the sheets
1	The next night I stayed More
1	Not over the top amazing , but I think I got my money 's worth
1	I frequently go to Livermore for business travel and always stay at this hotel
1	What else could you ask for when you are traveling
1	Stayed for a week   from early checkin assistance to excellent accommodations , it was all I could hope for in a multiday business stay
1	I expected more from a Wyndham hotelbathroom was very small , not enough counter space for makeup bag and shaving kit
1	My husband and I came out here from Tennessee for a business conference   couples getaway
1	It 's our first full day here and I 'm already so impressed with this hotel
1	The hotel was fine , I with the shower specifically the shower head was cleaner , it could you a thorough scrubbing and white vinegar cleaning
1	They offered a dinnertheaterhotel package that was perfect for our first time at this venue
1	My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights for a wedding in Livermore in July
1	I would n't recommend this hotel to my worst enemy
1	There is absolutely no excuse for stealing my friend 's personal belongings whom were also staying at this hotel the same nights
1	I left my cell phone charger in room 305 and came back a few More
1	My husband and I stayed at the Hawthorne Suites by Wyndham Livermore , CA
1	We got the room with 2 queen beds and they were so comfortable
1	I have a very bad back and they had such comfort and support
1	I have never in my life been treated so terribly
1	I was charged for something I did n't receive More
1	This meant that any time our curtains were open , we were on display for whoever was walkingdriving by
1	It also meant we could n't safely leave our windows open at night and had to rely on the very , very loud air conditioner
1	If I was back in town for work , I 'd stay here again for sure
1	A free night 's stay or at least a discount on my next stay may have helped the situation
1	They arranged a cab for us , offered us hot tea after a late night arrival on a very cold evening , they check in on us the next day to make sure we were settled and had everything we needed
1	They made sure our stay at their hotel was comfortable
1	An extra thank you to Candice , Bea , and Donna
1	We had a king bed   that 's all they had available , but the two doubles may have been a little tight
1	We did use a rollaway cot for our son 5'10 , 150lbs and wound up putting the mattress on the floor the second night as the frame was simply too small for a teenage boy
1	I often stay at Hampton Inns but one was not conveniently located so I opted for this Fairfield Inn near Bingham ton because it seemed to be about the same quality although a little pricier
1	I would have walked out but I had a no cancellation reservation
1	When I mentioned the unattractiveness to the desk clerk she acknowledged the problem and very nicely explained that the place was due for a major overhaul
1	This experience guarantees that I will avoid Fairfield in the future and recommend that other travelers stay away also
1	Worst and most expensive hotel we stayed in on a 11 night vacation sleeping in 9 different cities in 6 states
1	since most important thing for me is bed comfort , I 'd say this is a winner
1	The staff was particularly friendly and helpful , the complimentary breakfast was great , and they had the most comfortable beds I have slept in at a hotel
1	This is the only place I will stay in Binghamton when I am there
1	I choose Fairfield Inn 's because I consistantly have a pleasurable experience there
1	Wished we had stayed somewhere else for our money
1	We were very happy with our stay
1	We were very happy with our stay
1	We were very happy with our stay
1	Adequate is the word I 'd use
1	We stayed here the night before a 5k Color Run
1	I think it 's his goal to find ' anything ' when he enters a hotel room
1	They did n't even cringe when we walked back in after the run covered in wild colors
1	When I went to front desk to see about having it removed , I had to wait about 10 minutes for desk person who apparently was only staff person on duty and was working desk and dealing with room issues   she went with me to room to remove bed
1	Finally , a couple had a huge , screaming fight in the middle of the night , which I found quite disturbing because I was concerned it could turn violent   not hotel 's fault but still Would return but probably only if there is no other option

1	Nice Hotel , close to Applebees , which delivered right to your room
1	Overall , I was very pleased with my stay
1	Greeted cordially not fake we were asked if we would need anything additional we were 6 adults and 5 children under the age of 6 renting 3 rooms
1	They had already put our rooms nearby even when requested at other hotels in advance this seems to be a HUGE request and usually not done We have stayed at other hotels in the area but your rooms are spacious and beds are wonderful
1	We will continue to return here anytime we are in the area
1	We were thrilled with everything from the cleanliness to the top notch breakfast to the kindness of everyone but , the very first person we met
1	She was the first person we approached behind the counter when we arrived
1	Later we learned that she was handling both the desk and the Housekeeping roles that night
1	If I were to judge the facility by this one person , I would have been disappointed in her lack of hospitality in answering our questions no smile , no patiencecranky
1	However the rest of our stay , and we did add an extra night , more than made up for it
1	This was my first getaway in 4 years on ANY kind of vacationfamily celebration , so I was really hoping for a good time
1	I really enjoyed the cleanliness , as I own a cleaning service here in MD
1	For example , almost had to convince the front desk to go through the effort to sell me another night stay
1	I almost went to another hotel because it seemed too much trouble to check me out and then check me back in
1	I had never stayed at a Fairfield Inn
1	I was very impressed with the staff , they were excellent
1	I had requested a rollaway bed with my reservation , but they said the request was n't there
1	No matter   they had one in my room within 20 mins of checkin
1	Would have loved to know they were under going major renovations before I booked the room
1	Love that we can walk to Applebee 's or Cracker Barrel
1	Our late evening arrival was no problem for the staff person who registered us
1	The parking access was perfect for my wife 's limited mobility and for carting our luggage to the room and back
1	We decided to stay another day and they were very helpful
1	We decided to stay another day and they were very helpful
1	Upon checking in was told that the place was booked with folks who are running from Isaac   the folks are depressed , sad and crying   we got a room with no problem as a matter of fact the parking lot and inside hotel were rather empty despite the fact that the place was booked   the room reaked   air conditioning unit blew out luke warm air despite having control turned to high cool   linens and bath towels were rough and view morewell worn
1	Not opposed to other cultures but if you are going to have that sort of thing waifing through the hotel you should advertise such
1	My expectations are a clean room with no visible signs of anything else would NOT recommend this place BTW the free breakfast was nothing more than day old bakery goods with what was suppose to be biscuits and gravy the folks running from Isaac would have been better off to weather the storm
1	I would sleep in my car before stay here again
1	I would sleep in my car before stay here again
1	The room was clean and there a good Denny across the street small beds and not enough towels breakfast was not up to par from my othere hotel stays and service at desk was quick but not a happy to see you kind just a here your key kind of thing but it did the job
1	You could hear every noise both upstairs and next door , not only that but every time a car started outside , it sounded like it was in your room
1	You could hear every noise both upstairs and next door , not only that but every time a car started outside , it sounded like it was in your room
1	Upon my request , both were replaced and we were offered a different room , but inspection of this room included holes in both the sheets and blanket
1	If I had n't booked on line I would have insisted on my money back

1	It was just okroom had a odor but carpet was newjust datedi guess you get what you pay for
1	There were no more first floor rooms , apparently , so we were stuck with climbing the stairs with our arthritis and artificial hips
1	Our room with two queen beds only had two sets of towels , so we had to hike back down to the desk for another set to More
1	we stayed for 2 nights the room was clean and beds were comfortable and it was in a good location close to a walmart and fast food resturants
1	we stayed for 2 nights the room was clean and beds were comfortable and it was in a good location close to a walmart and fast food resturants

1	My family and I enjoyed our stay very much , the kids loved the complimentary breakfast which also saved us money
1	Stayed a night with my kiddo it was A good place to shower and sleep we was n't really around to do much else
1	My husband and I had been making a trip to California and back
1	We used Wyndham hotels as they seemed to be the best
1	Our journey to California was excellentTHEN I reserved another hotels The Days Inn El Reno
1	We got the King Bed No smoking for one night
1	We spent one night there and would stay again
1	The clerk was very helpful the next morning when my prescription sunglasses needed to be fixed
1	I attempt to use my Wyndham Rewards
1	He said you can just call this number and tell them to combine the two numbers
1	I asked for a detail print out of charges and he was n't happy that I asked for one
1	I have stayed several times in the past and never dissatisfied with my stay or any of the staff
1	Room was filthy , had bugs crawling up the wall , load people at all hours and we were on the top floor ,
1	We stayed here on our way to visit family
1	We got to the motel , Melissa the front desk clerk , was very friendly and got us checked in quickly
1	The rooms were big and seemed clean enough at first but as we settled in for the night we could tell the housekeepers defiantly needed to be retrained on how to clean More
1	Now everytime I see his likeness I will run away
1	They were dingy and you could see past stains on them
1	Walls had hand stains on them

1	Hey , if you want a Hilton or even a Holiday Inn this may not be for you but if you want Waikiki on a hometown beach budget its a winner
1	I booked this hotel for mid October months ago
1	In early October , I called this hotel to find out more about the bathroom size and to my horror , the hotel just cancelled my reservations without informing me
1	Can you imagine if I had arrived on that day with 2 children to only find out I have no where to stay More
1	For the price that I paid for the room , it was horrific meaning that when me and my wife got into the room , IT WAS VERY HOT

1	I m Flur stehen i m Besenschrank eben Besen und luxurises Toilettenpapier
1	Nur weil am Besenschrank noch das Hotel vier Jahreszeiten grt und weil man in der Lobby eben jenes Hotels eincheckt , und auch ganz schnell wieder aus , heit das ja nicht , dass die Unterkunft i m Nebengebude auch die fr 4 Sterne gesetzen Standards erfllen muss

1	I have written about The Point previously but wanted to validate another fantastic time here
1	We celebrated our 20th anniversary at The Point this past week
1	GM Cameron Karger and team outdid themselves again and again and again
1	Lunch can be wherever you want it   a picnic on a small island , on the deck , in your room Breakfast is when and where you want it
1	From the minute you arrive until the minute you sadly have to leave The Point , you are treated as if your person needs and desires are the only thing that matter
1	My review is long overdue but I tell so many people about this place that I felt I should add it to TripAdvisor
1	We visited The Point in October 2014   and it was simply amazing   every single aspect of the visit was pure perfection
1	I am an Adirondack resident and absolutely loved the dcor , the setting , the boats , More
1	With our children all over the age of 21 it 's fun to go Out and enjoy a great meal snd casual drinks eith our children
1	I have never have been dissspinted with any thing I have ordered there to eat , and the orange crushes are amazing
1	I 'm a city girl and that took me a bit to get used to and settle into this mountainous element
1	After having stayed at The Point for five days back in June of 2011 , my wife and I elected to revisit this wonderful Slice of Heaven on Earth , this time for two weeks for the Autumn colors
1	We d just hosted our daughters wedding two weeks prior , and I felt that an indulgent getaway was just what the Mother of the More
1	From the warmest and crunchiest breakfast croissant to a lit fireplace and hot tea in the cabin to greet you after your hikeAnd every single person will do their outmost to keep you happy
1	I was lucky enough to spend 2 nights at The Point last year in February after dreaming about this place for quite some time
1	It was a week end with my cousin visiting me in New York and we drove there on a cold snowy day
1	As soon as we arrived we were in another world
1	We visited The Point two years ago , and decided to return for our 25th Wedding Anniversary
1	I was a little apprehensive   so often when you loved somewhere first time the return is a disappointment and we had such an amazing time   would this visit be as good We arrived by car to be greeted warmly by staff including More
1	The only place i 'll stay in Houston
1	The rooms are a bit small and bathrooms are not luxurious by today 's standards , but they are more than adequate and everything else about the place more than makes up for any shortcomings in that department
1	The front desk verified my expenses and gave me a print out of my charges
1	Met up with our daughter and had a great time in Houston
1	We were there in time to see the harvest decorations being put away and the magnificent Christmas decor being put up
1	We have been staying at the Houstonian hotel for 20 years now and it 's never let us down
1	When the staff calls us by our names year after year What does that tell u about the hotel management
1	We live on the other side of Houston and felt that our stay at the Houstonian was a wonderful getaway
1	Make sure you stay a couple of days to take advantage of all of the amenities including the Trellis Spa
1	I loved walking the beautiful and easy to walk path around the grounds each morning and seeinghearing all the birds
1	I did n't use the pool areas , but they are gorgeous and spacious
1	We always have a pleasant stay at the Houstonian , love the atmosphere , the rooms are also dark in the morning due to the lush greenery so we are able to get a good nights rest
1	We were celebrating our triplet grandchildren 's 6th Birthday their favorite hotel and they were surprised by the hotel with a plate of fresh cookies and milk
1	I checked in for 10 days , but checked out after 2
1	The king size bed was the most uncomfortable bed I had slept in for decades
1	I honestly thought I was sleeping on a sheet of plywood
1	Tge staff is friendly but you can tell they inexperienced , mostly in there 20s
1	By 2 nd day knew our name and were so nice
1	Nice hotel , secluded so that you do n't feel like you 're in the city but convenient for business great exercise facilities for working out
1	We stop at the Houstonian every year on our way to ski and my 2 teenage boys just love it
1	I took my pregnant girlfriend here as a last minute getaway in our hometown before her 3rd child arrived we relaxed , rested , and enjoy the quite
1	We were in Houston for a family event so several families were staying at the Houstonian
1	We will be staying here anytime we go to Houston
1	We LOVED our time there
1	My husband and I took a stacation here and it indeed is a five star from the amazing service to all the updated amenities , pools , gym everything was almost perfect
1	We chose this hotel after I verified that their shuttle went within 3 miles also viewing this on their website
1	Well time to take off and there was ' no shuttle ' available on Sunday after 6 pm which I could not verify
1	We stayed a couple of nights for our daughter 's bday and Father 's day weekend for me as well
1	Our room had a nice view that seemed like we were in the woods
1	Just make sure to wear or bring socks but worry not as they sell socks if you happen to forget
1	We all enjoyed our stay
1	From my wife getting pampered inside their spa for most of the time to me and our teenage kids working a lot of sweat playing all sorts of sports
1	We stayed at The Houstonian to celebrate our 17th Wedding Anniversary and are so glad we chose this hotel
1	There were a few hiccups in our stay , but we had such a nice time that the things that did go wrong are forgiven
1	I will say the bathrooms are very small when you open the door there is only about 5 inches from the door to the toilet
1	It is hidden away from the busy roads and noise of the surrounding area , so you really feel like you are able to relax as if you were somewhere far away
1	Will definitely stay again next time we are in Houston
1	Due to the flooding in the area we left a night early , just to be on the safe side
1	I would definitely recommend this hotel for a luxurious weekend getaway
1	They greet you with a smile and a sense of urgency to help
1	They provide cold bottles of water each time you leave
1	While it may look like this hotel is off the beaten path , I assure you that it is easy to get to and really gets you out of the fray of the Galleria traffic without leaving the neighborhood
1	Once we finally talked to someone that could help , Kevin , he was extremely short and unpleasant
1	When we came down for dinner at the restaurant he did n't address us but talked to every other table around us
1	Hotel was nice , amenities even nicer but I was disappointed at the services especially given how expensive everything is
1	I would recommend this hotel to everyone looking for a place to stay in Houston
1	My wife and I stayed at the Houstonian for 3 nights in October
1	My wife has been a regular 5 times a week gym user for over 16 years and she has been a member of many gyms in NYC and London and this is by far the best she has experienced
1	In the luxurious locker rooms there is free coffee , tea , ice tea , water etc We also ate at the bar and Olivette restaurant and the food and service were excellent
1	We can to town for a college football game and we a little nervous about the room size some complained about , but found it acceptable
1	We will stay here again when we retuen to Houston
1	Amazed at what we paid for a room on the concierge floor that included free daily continental breakfast , early evening cocktails and hors d'oeuvres , and after dinner dessert buffet
1	Will definitely be my goto hotel any time I 'm in Houston
1	My family and I like to vist spokane we went on priceline and found that this was the cheapest and it had a indoor pool and and gym We were very pleased the room is clean , smells clean with friendly people and pet friendly
1	You get a 7 breakfast credit for the restaurant which was cool , although I think I prefer traditional continental breakfasts that are buffet style
1	I always stay at this hotel when visiting my mother who lives in Madison , Me
1	We stayed one night on a family visit to my daughter 's camp
1	We 'd just come from a Hilton Garden Inn , which is a very good step up , so a comparison to the Waterville Grand Hotel is a bit loaded
1	We stayed at the Comfort Inn last year , and I 'll just say we were determined NOT to stay there again
1	I 'd go back to the Best Western , but I 'd suggest you drop the grand from the name
1	We had 3 of us and they had no queen rooms available
1	After 10 days they felt like family
1	My only hope for my next stay would be better cleaningupkeep of the air conditioningheating unit
1	I am a 75yr old Disabled Vet and had requested 2 bed room on first floor as I have walking disability from service
1	I always stay at this hotel when visiting my mother who lives in Madison , Me
1	Rooms are decent but you can forget about the amenities they advertise
1	If you try to have breakfast there take a look around the restaurant and see how many table have foodor more likely you will see empty tables with angryhungry customers and 1 server trying to keep everyone happyIts a decent hotel that does not hire enough staff to maintain the amenities
1	I will try a different hotel when I am in Waterville again
1	I know , I know , we are in Mainebut still
1	I know , I know , we are in Mainebut still
1	I do n't know why I thought sweet potato encrusted haddock sounded good
1	My biggest complaint was the WIFI
1	I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done
1	While I could get my phone to connect , my computer would not recognize the free signal
1	After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group , the answer that I got was to sit next to the door
1	The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there
1	However the restaurant that is attached to the hotel is what they use for the ' included breakfast ' , which has the poorest customer service and rudest employees I 've encountered in a while
1	Ok overall   we stayed one night with our dogs
1	We were limited in our choices because of this
1	I just ran up to the middle of Maine for a one day business trip
1	All the people that I had interacted with were very nice , from the people at the hotel to the business staff and owner , and all the people at the various restaurants we ate at
1	They host birthday parties and it would be good if they posted times because it gets way too crazy to enjoy when that many kids are there
1	We booked a one night stay at the Best Western on a trip to Maine
1	But I called the front desk and they took care of it
1	I am allergic to dogs but did not have any problem in our room
1	Who wants to wait for coffee I finally got my own out in the hallway
1	Our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we did n't want to wait
1	While I would n't choose the spot for a long term stay , it 's location was perfect for an ontheway hotel , right on the Interstate
1	WiFi frequently stopped working and the staff would not help and told us that we had to work it out with the IT tech from some other companyI would expect the hotel to take care of this3
1	We payed for 3 people but they said they would only provide breakfast for 2
1	Overall the stay was a good valueDear williamtO4368AZ   Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel
1	We 're glad you enjoyed your stay , and we will be sure to pass your comments along to the staff at O'Brien 's Restaurant   We hope you 'll stay with us again on our next trip to the Waterville area
1	The person at the counter was snotty when she saw that I had reserved online
1	It was without a doubt the worst prime rib I have ever eaten or should I say tried to eat
1	Our server asked how it was so I told More
1	They offer a full menu , but you pay for it
1	They offer a full menu , but you pay for it
1	I was a little disappointed when I went to swim in the morning that there was a senior exercise class going on using the entire pool and only a single lap aisle so no room for me to take a swim
1	My girlfriend and I visited Waterville Maine for my birthday and to see some of my family
1	I would recommend this hotel to any of my friends looking for a cheap getaway
1	I was happy to see a brand new bed in our room , and the bathroom looked very nice
1	The kitchen lost our room service order , but did take six dollars off the bill
1	So I would recommend this hotel to others , but I would tell them to wait a while until they get the renos done and sort out a few issues
1	We looked at the room and left and rented another hotel , we had already signed in and were werelocked into the contrac with our prebooking through expedia
1	When I reserved my room through Hotelscom it mentioned Free Breakfast   what a joke
1	We had the heat full blast , and we froze in the middle of the night
1	yes , those computers did n't work right and that she knew you could n't open any attachments and that staples was across the street
1	nice experience , breakfast the first day was questionable , but we tried the next day and was pleased
1	OK hotell i utkanten av Waterville
1	The next day they never sent housekeeping to clean
1	We got our own flatware and coffee
1	The second day there was more staff but the waitress decided to change my plain yogurt to blueberry
1	I asked for a manager to contact me but no one called
1	Called corporate and they wanted to give me points
1	Called Mr Kong , the president of Best Western and they will give me a 5000 credit , the first offer was a gift certificate for 5000 No thanks , I wo nt ever stay in another Best Western again
1	The hotel manager has still not contacted me , its been three weeks
1	Room includes a voucher for up to 1400 of your breakfast order , so you get a hot meal straight from the short order cook , not some steam tablecereal bar like most places
1	We enjoyed two great days away
1	Wifi did n't work well with just one of our three devices
1	When I got to Watervilled I remembered there are some much nicer places to stay such as the Hampton Inn and the Fireside Inn
1	Skip the breakfast the service is very , very slow and food is sub par , they overcooked the eggs Benedict I ordered , plus the cost of 425 for juice is expensive
1	I would recommend going across the street to the Governor 's Restaurant Bakery
1	The front desk was very helpful and accommodatingDear Lawrence S   Thank you for staying with us and taking the time to write this review
1	We 're glad you enjoyed your room and our helpful staff
1	I apologize that you did not enjoy your breakfast at O'Brien 's
1	We will pass along your comments to their management
1	I 've stayed here many times over the years while traveling through maine
1	Rooms also have all the amenities you could need for your stay
1	We stayed for 3 nights and the first night was great
1	I love dogs and have 2 of my own but do not bring them to hotels
1	But I called the front desk and they took care of it
1	I am allergic to dogs but did not have any problem in our roomThe breakfast service was horribly slow , both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food
1	I finally got my own out in the hallway
1	Our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we did n't want to wait
1	However the restaurant that is attached to the hotel is what they use for the ' included breakfast ' , which has the poorest customer service and rudest employees I 've encountered in a while
1	We booked this hotel about a week ahead of time and were pleased
1	The only downfall was that someone put our bill under the door in the morning and it was substantially lower than what I had paid through expedia
1	When I inquired , I was told that it was a mistake and that I should not have gotten a bill
1	I was here for 5 days due to work
1	We were touring colleges for the week and this was my least favorite hotel
1	I am in Waterville every year for fire department training and always go home disappointed about the local accommodations
1	This year my hotel was clean , quiet and very comfortable
1	nice experience , breakfast the first day was questionable , but we tried the next day and was pleased
1	Well they must be in the midst of renovations because they did not tell any of their customers and there was dust and materials left all over the hallways
1	My family went down at 815 am and they had nothing ready
1	Needless to say I am never going to stay there again and we checked out early and went to eat at the Friendly 's next door where it was cleanerI wish that I can get my money refunded because it was not worth the money that I spent

1	Needless to say I am never going to stay there again and we checked out early and went to eat at the Friendly 's next door where it was cleanerI wish that I can get my money refunded because it was not worth the money that I spent
1	We only stayed one night but this is a good place to stay
1	Overall we were very satisfied with our stay
1	All of the staff was very helpful with anything that I needed during my stay
1	No problems , except that it would be good if you would provide tea bags for the people , like me , who do not drink coffee
1	Also , you should use larger type for your questionnaire , for those , like me , whose vision is not all that good
1	I booked 2 separate days for my stay
1	Upon checking in they told me that I had one stay booked
1	Gave me excellent directions to my n ext destination
1	When we got to the hotel our room was not available and they tried to give us a double twin bed room when we had payed for a king size
1	Then we had to wait a half hour for our room , even though when I called earlier in the day they said our room would be ready when we got there and we could come whenever since we had payed already
1	We also had ants in our room
1	Overall it was not a great stay , and I would like to request a free night stay or else I probably will not stay at your hotels anymore
1	I used to stay in them a good amount , and I am sorry to say that but that is how I feel
1	We travel and shop in Maine once or sometimes twice a month ever year and normally we stay in Bangor , sometimes we would even travel a little more south to Augusta and drive right by Waterville
1	Now this is n't the first time we stayed here , maybe half a dozen times , but this is my first review
1	We realized that inflatedDear Wayne Jean   We 're so happy you enjoyed your stay
1	Look forward to your next stay with us , and truly hope to see you again soon
1	Even though I bookedpayed through Expedia , when they swiped my credit card for incidentals they somehow charged another room to my card
1	Two days later , still waiting for the charge to be removed from my card
1	I had a nice time at the Best Western Hotel
1	I was in room 216 , on the 2nd floor
1	I have a disability where I have a hard time walking so IDear erincorbo   Thank you so much for taking the time to write this review
1	We 're happy you enjoyed your stay , the hotel , the staff , and our pool , and hope you 'll be sure to stay with us again on any trips that bring you to the Waterville area
1	When I reserved my room through Hotelscom it mentioned Free Breakfast   what a joke
1	We had the heat full blast , and we froze in the middle of the night
1	Needed to leave a day sooner than expected , knew this at check in and told them so
1	But since I had booked thru Expedia , they stated that I had to get approval thru them , which I did
1	Upon checkout I asked to verify that I was only being charged for the 3 nights as opposed to the 4 , and they said I was only being charged for the 3 days , and gave me a receipt showing that
1	But the next day , my credit card used for that stay posted the amount for a 4 night stay
1	I will never use this Best Western hotel or Expedia again
1	Very pleasant staff , ordered room service   food was good   the rooms and hallway were quiet both nights we stayed
1	Would I stay here again , yes I would
1	We had 3 of us and they had no queen rooms available
1	We ended up arriving earlier than expected and when I called to see if we could check in early the response was very welcomingMy only critique would be the constant slamming of doors in the morning by housekeeping
1	They use the lock bar to keep the door inlocked while they go in and out to clean
1	The house keeping staff was kind , but when I asked for things for the room they would tell me to get them myself
1	One waitress told off another in front of everyone and another waiter ignored our table after taking our order
1	our stay was greatmy grandson really enjoyed the poolMy son   wife took advantage of the fitness centerwould have liked to see the menu with prices otherwise great
1	Awesome hotel , we brought our 6 month old son and he absolutely loved the saltwater pool it actually helped his dry skin he had on his back
1	Guests get vouchers for breakfast which is ordered off a menu   not convenient if you 're in a hurry in the morning like we were
1	The first thing the waitress told us when we walked in was that she just seated a large party and it was going to be a while
1	IMy only problem was that they did n't have the hot tub that Hotelscom had listed
1	We got a coupon for 7 off per person for breakfast but we waited over 40 minutes for our breakfast and when it did arrive it was cold
1	hotel room clean   beds comfy   advertised free wifi in rm and our rm had no wifi and when I went to the lobby they had 3 computers but only 1 worked
1	The pool attendant could have let our kids do a bit more in the pool we are are responsible parents and were watching them ourselves
1	We wanted them to have fun and not have a pool attendant constantly on top of them
1	We only stayed 2 nights to visit people we know in the area
1	We only spent a night   got there late and left early morning
1	We were spending only 1 night to help out with my Dad
1	The hotel staff were friendly and helpful , Our room was on the first floor , which I normally do not like , was very spacious desk , sitting chair , refrigerator , large TV King Bed
1	My biggest complaint was the WIFI
1	I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done
1	While I could get my phone to connect , my computer would not recognize the free signal
1	After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group , the answer that I got was to sit next to the door
1	The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there
1	I was very firm , so much that I could n't get comfortable
1	Ok overall   we stayed one night with our dogs
1	We were limited in our choices because of this
1	I have not stayed in other hotels in area so I don'the have a basis for comparison
1	The pool attendant could have let our kids do a bit more in the pool we are are responsible parents and were watching them ourselves
1	We wanted them to have fun and not have a pool attendant constantly on top of them
1	You get a 7 breakfast credit for the restaurant which was cool , although I think I prefer traditional continental breakfasts that are buffet style
1	I 'm from the city and found it to be comfortable and quiet my friend is from the country and was bothered by the lights from the outside and the latenight chatter of guests next door
1	The hotel was fine overall , but when I grabbed the last bath towel I found it to be of rag quality
1	I would stay again , but check the towels before I needed to use one
1	Overall we look forward to staying at BestDear E5985FNmarye   Thank you for the taking the time to write this awesome review
1	We 're happy you enjoyed your time with us , and look forward to having you back to rest and relax with us again soon
1	We stayed for 3 nights and the first night was great
1	I love dogs and have 2 of my own but do not bring them to hotels
1	My wife sister died while we were there
1	The only thing is they keep it to cold at he front desk and restaurant
1	We would stay there the next time we go buy
1	I was a little disappointed when I went to swim in the morning that there was a senior exercise class going on using the entire pool and only a single lap aisle so no room for me to take a swimIt was a good stay and I would stay there again
1	The vegitables were so mushy you could n't pick them up with your fork
1	I would avoid this hotel until they do some major renovations
1	Hotel is older but they come in and clean room every
1	I read some bad comments about the food but we found it to be very good
1	You can get the buffet on the weekend or order off the menu with a certain   credit
1	Crazy lady at the desk would not give me a receipt   she said I had to get if from hotel
1	And the guest computer   business 's center had such a strong fire wall I could not open my flash drive to open my documents and micro soft office
1	The man in the hot tub followed me into the locker room and made an offer to give me free whatever   that 's not the hotels fault just kinda crazy
1	We were in Waterville for our Colby reunion
1	Service was pretty slow in the hotel restaurant where we had our breakfast , but luckily we were not in a rush
1	The food at breakfast was good but we had to wait 40 minutes to get it because there was only one cook working
1	I was here for 5 days due to work
1	Enjoyed our evening of food and conversationDear Sandbar16   Thank you so much for taking the time to write this review
1	We hope you 'll be back with us again in the future
1	We 'll be sure to pass along your kind words to Sarah at O'Brien 's
1	I have stayed at a lot of hotels this year and this one by far was the best
1	Attached Irish barrestaurant we great
1	The housekeeper cleaned our room when we were out and took a knife and pizza pan that belonged to me obviously thinking it belonged to the hotel and the restaurant staff managed to scour the kitchen , find and return them to me before I left not an easy task to find one knife
1	All in all it was a nice stay , and I would n't mind returning , I would like to see the improvements
1	After 10 days they felt like family
1	My only hope for my next stay would be better cleaningupkeep of the air conditioningheating unit
1	very convenient for over night stay right off the I 95 restaurant   pub in hotel , gas station across street and other fast food restaurant up the road and a few shopping stores
1	We were passing through so one night stay
1	Pasta over cooked , chicken rubbery , even my 4 yr old would n't eat it
1	The only complaint I would voice would be that the outer door that was used for entry to the building in the back of the hotel was kept open at night due to a broken lock
1	The pictures of the property on the web did not match what we actually experiencedNo security at the hotel , as all of the doors from the parking lot and center courtyard where broken and not using the key pad to enter
1	To top that off the mattress was as hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossibleIf it was not for us driving all day and that it was late in the evening we would have not stayed at this hotel
1	The hotel was okay the hotel was fine I must put a bunch of words in here to tell you simply that the hotel was okay
1	My son and I thoroughly enjoyed our 4 day stay , the rooms were VERY clean , the staff courteous and the hospitality OUTSTANDING
1	We had a lovely bacon egg brkf for 0 , , , All the staff were super friendly and seemed like they loved their jobs
1	We instantly could smell cig smoke when we went to the second floor
1	We also could smell MJ coming from one room
1	I hope this hotel changes their policy as it would be a shame to ruin such a great Reno , d to new hotel
1	We stayed here for 1 night
1	For sure this would be my second home if it was n't so far away from my Massachusetts home
1	We are glad you enjoyed your stay , and we look forward to having you back with us on your next trip to the area
1	We had business to attend to in Waterville
1	You could not pay me to stay here again
1	Shower which I was even scared to step into barefoot did n't get above Luke warm
1	We enjoyed our breakfast and the allowance 14 given to cover breakfast
1	I definitely would consider staying at the Best Western Plus if I was staying in Waterville again
1	My family stayed at this hotel and had a great weekend
1	I would recommend this hotel to anyone and I want to thank the staff for a fun weekend away
1	We stayed because we were visiting Thomas College
1	The next day they never sent housekeeping to clean
1	We got our own flatware and coffee
1	The second day there was more staff but the waitress decided to change my plain yogurt to blueberry
1	I asked for a manager to contact me but no one called
1	Called corporate and they wanted to give me points
1	Called Mr Kong , the president of Best Western and they will give me a 5000 credit , the first offer was a gift certificate for 5000 No thanks , I wo nt ever stay in another Best Western again
1	The hotel manager has still not contacted me , its been three weeks
1	Hotel is older but they come in and clean room every
1	I read some bad comments about the food but we found it to be very good
1	You can get the buffet on the weekend or order off the menu with a certain credit
1	I chose this hotel for it 's location , price , and because they have a pool and fitness room onsite
1	I really enjoyed my stay and plan to More
1	I think just left over from the a laundering process but still disconcerting and if we had not arrived so late at night , I would have asked to switch rooms
1	We really enjoyed our stay at the Best Western Grand
1	This worked out well for us , because we did not have time for a sit down breakfast the morning we checked out
1	They made a room available to our parties to get away from the barrestaurant , because it was wing night for the locals
1	Pool attendant was n't friendly , but everyone is entitled to a badDear BostonParker   Thank you for taking the time to write this kind review , and I 'm so sorry for your loss , and that it was a funeral that brought you to our property
1	I 'm glad you enjoyed your stay , even under the circumstances , and I apologize that some of the interactions you had were not representative of the majority of
1	Having moved rooms because of noise twice , I 'm still waiting for the manager to return my call
1	I hope the owner is aware of the poor service the hotel provides at its front desk and officeDear Allpro63 , Thank you for taking the time to write this review
1	We appreciate your feedback
1	My sincere apologies that you had to move rooms twice during your stay
1	Sometimes noise is beyond our control but we do try to do our best for each guest
1	We had a wonderful night staying in this hotel for one night
1	I loved that we got a voucher for   off breakfast at the attached restaurant
1	My two daughters and I stayed in the hotel 's suite for a local dance competition
1	Great place to stay when visiting your child at Colby
1	We will stay there again when visiting Colby
1	My wife sister died while we were there
1	The only thing is they keep it to cold at he front desk and restaurant
1	We would stay there the next time we go buy
1	They include a breakfast beginning at 700 but we had to leave before 7 so can not comment on the breakfast
1	But the best part was O'Brien 's , where you could get meals and drinks on the premises
1	On our trip to Canada from Connecticut , We stayed the night in this lovely hotel
1	They brought the suitcases to our rooms in record time , and there were cookies and juice waiting for all visitors
1	Add to that a lovely buffet breakfast in the morning before we got on our way
1	Told front desk I could n't walk far so I need something close to the exit they put me as far away as they could ,
1	We stayed here on our way to Nova Scotia
1	We live out of town and we stayed at this hotel because my fianc had to work 12 hours on Friday in Waterville and had to be to work very early on Saturday for another 10 hour day , we stayed thinking he would get more rest
1	Stayed night for my son 's birthday
1	My one night stay was outstanding
1	You could not pay me to stay here again
1	Staff   lovely helpful people   can you ask for anymore Hotel   a little dated but still functional   More
1	The receptionist checking me in , however , appeared to have no interest in her job or me
1	I was very disappointed that the WIFI did not work in my room
1	When I complained about it in the morning I was told it works great in all rooms
1	OK hotell i utkanten av Waterville
1	O'Brien 's restaurant makes a great breakfast that is individually prepared , not the typical rubber egg buffet that you get at most hotels
1	I will go there again for my next business trip to Waterville
1	My daughter wanted to book a hotel with friends for the weekend
1	Hotel gives you a voucher , so you have to pay a little money for the breakfast , but it was More
1	We stayed for the weekend , good area for shopping , the place needs a little updating , but the staff more than makes up for that
1	They have a very nice breakfast plan where you can order what you like from their restaurant for the breakfast
1	We were 2 adults and a teen , so wish they had larger than doublesized beds , and it would have been better to have had 3 bath towels instead of 2
1	However , when I checked in for the first visit I was informed that the room I had reserved was n't available and they put me in a room with two double beds
1	We enjoyed our stay
1	My wife and my inlaws stayed here over Thanksgiving weekend
1	We chose it because they are pet friendly , up to 85 pounds I believe
1	Our room was as nice as you would expect from a Best Western
1	The room service did not turn the heat off during the day so it was sweltering at night when we got back
1	Seeing as it 's in the middle of Maine , you 're not going to get a 5star hotel
1	I 've had WiFi issues here in the past , but this time I had the 3rd floor , and no issues at all
1	to share your opinion of this businesswith YP visitors across the United Statesand in your neighborhood
1	Stay here alot , kids go to school in Columbia and this hotel has become my home away from home
1	I did n't like hearing slamming doors throughout the night from other guests
1	When we first walked into our building , there was a skunky smell
1	We did go across the street to the grocery store and got some air spray for our room
1	If you 're looking for a resort stay and planning on spending your entire trip in the hotel , this is not your place
1	The cleaning staff left dirty towels in our room which we found when we checked into our room
1	The onsite clerk came to pick them up but did not apologize and was hesitant when we first asked her
1	I booked the hotel last minute as I was simply too tired to continue driving
1	I 'm in grad school so I needed cheap
1	The only things that I considered to be under what I paid was the bed and room itself
1	The worst was that every time the AC unit kicked off , a noise would start I 'm assuming some kind of duct work that sounded like someone was knocking at my door
1	i would been nice if we did n't get the wheelchair accessible
1	When asked for extra blanket , i got a bedspread they are so dirty should not be used in any hotel
1	My daughter was moving into Mizzou so we went up the night before I made the reservations online I must say when I walked into the lobby of the hotel seem older but nice I then checked into my room went and got something to eat came back use the restroom to see two tiny bugs not sure what they were at this point I killed them and wanted to my room saw a roach crawling up my drink when I called the front desk I told the guy I have bugs in my room he said yes as if this were a regular occurrence and then took him about 15 minutes to get me moved to a different room to say the least I was absolutely mortified this hotel is disgusting
1	Hotel is a little outdated and worn around the edges , but you can tell they work to keep it clean
1	Worst hotel stay I have had in years
1	Called my room at 4 am because he did n't know how to do something and after a few relized he called wrong room
1	But I did n't complain , because we were out most of the day
1	I did n't know about it because I went to bed
1	My daughter told me about it the next day
1	And I would recommend to people who absolutely have to take their dogs with them while they travel
1	To top it off , upon return home , everything in our bags , including the bags themselves required washing
1	Hotel is old but you get what you pay for
1	But room was adequate although there was a fairly loud drone sound coming from the roof that I could hear not only in my room but also as I walked down the hall
1	But like I said , we did n't have a problem and a good experience
1	Sneezedcoughed a bit my first night there , but seems to lessen the second night
1	My friends and I enjoyed the hotel
1	This hotel is the best bang for your buck in Columbia
1	I have 2 kids going to school in Columbia and when I come to visit I always check to see if this hotel has the best deal and it usually does
1	I stay here whenever I can , highly recommend for the price
1	I wo n't stay at a Howard Johnson again
1	Pillows were the size of my hand
1	It was fine for our purposes and we would stay there again
1	We asked the desk clerk and he said that the staff did n't come to prepare the food
1	I ca n't recommend Howard Johnson to my friends , family or coworkers and I do not plan on using Howard Johnson again
1	We wanted a clean , decent , reasonably priced hotel for the night
1	night on a cross country trip and I got that
1	We had a quiet incident free evening , you ca n't ask for better than that
1	We go there to visit my son and we would certainly stay there again
1	We stayed here for Family Weekend at Mizzou
1	I also was n't expecting to spend all night smelling the food from the banquet rooms downstairs
1	I was n't expecting to be amazed at the price I paid for this room , but I was at least expecting to have had them keep up with routine maintenance and cleaning , and maybe put in some air fresheners in the hallway to counteract the smells from the banquets
1	Overall , the bed was comfortable , the shower was hot , and I only needed someplace for 1 night to attend a conference at the university , so it served it 's purpose
1	We paid with tax 15500 for the room with 3 beds due to the fact we have older kids and they refuse to sleep in the same bed no biggie when we got to our room for the night and turned down the bed the cover had several hairs inbedded in the cover , the sheets had several cigarette burn holes in it
1	The little doily that I 'm assuming should have been on the table under the phone was behind the table and on the floor , I 'm sure was there for some timeI totally understand a quick cheap place to stay but , when you are up all night worrying about if the place is going to burn down
1	I 'm glad our room was at the end of the hall by the EXIT door
1	You will not find my family there
1	I did speak to a manager I 'm assuming since he said he could hear out my issues and he gave me a whopping 20 off so instead of 155 I am paying 12400 not satisfied and will not return
1	I wish I could get the picture to upload
1	Husband and I stayed one night there we like the room and people that worked there were nice plane on going back wish we could of staying the hole weekend
1	After driving 712 hours I really needed to stop
1	I got into my room and it was clean and large
1	Super close to everything , within 1015 minutes from most attractionsrestaurants we wanted to visit
1	We stayed their one night on our way to tunica msIts located next to a large strip mall in osage beachWe stayed in a regular room , but they offer theme rooms as wellWe did have a problem with the tv remote , but the lady at the front desk was very nice and curtious , and tried to do another remote but did not work , Come More
1	We were able to try out a different suite from our last visit
1	The free breakfast was ok We only tried it once during our stay though
1	Our stay we did not try the breakfast but there was a lot of people in there eating
1	Comfortable bed with crisp sheets and a luxury blanket not the cheap Polly kind , room smells good , very clean , affordable price , easy to find , plenty of parking , shopping right next door , close to the lake   OVI will continue be our go to place whenever we visit Lake of the Ozarks
1	Was nice for couples weekend , and will return with our family
1	My wife and I stayed there on Thursday , May 26th , for the very first time
1	We were pleasantly surprised at this place as it proved to be almost everything they had advertised
1	Our checkin was easily done and the room assignment was fine with the exception we did have to climb a flight of stairs with luggage to get to More
1	When we got to our room the key lock was jammed called front desk she tried to explain how to jiggle it right so it would open
1	I did n't know it would take 20 minutes to get the door opened each time but whatever
1	We had what we needed can not complain
1	The service was horrible , the cleaning crew wore regular street clothes and when they came to my room banging on the door at 1103am that check out was 11 am
1	I was scared , could n't tell who they were considering the hotel was in a seedy part of town , next to a truck stop
1	I asked her cleaning lady to identify herself and then she came back with two others who could n't speak English
1	Even tho I had another night 's reservation , they failed to confirmcheck
1	I could go on on on but I 'm sure u get my point
1	If I was n't in a desperate situation from last minute planning to attend the UK vs USC game in South Carolina and every hotel in the city booked
1	the woman has flipped out did n't realize that I had paid through all my stuff in the parking lot by contact was stolen a couple of the items were stolen it will crack them all over the place tons of illegal activity I feared for my life I will never stay there again I beg you not ever stay there if you are single female I was propositioned about 16x it could even walk out of my room I had a layover for 14 hours at the only reason I picked that hotel is it was 1 mile away I can not believe they stole things from my suitcase and do all my things in the parking lot he did not know that I had booked another day if you guys get off the property get off the property I called the cops I file charges it was the worst experience of my life she did the same thing to another man he threw coffee in her face she got hit its just it was a hole that experience I can not believe they stole my things out of my suitcase unbelievable
1	I was really impressed by this Super 8 motel and would recommend it for anybody wanting to or having to be in Columbia , SC
1	The two rooms given to us did not have running water so the crews were given other rooms but then a lady came yelling at them to get out , when they presented her with the new keys she told them if they did not leave she would call the police
1	When I tried to get a refund SAM , the mgr said no , they left because they wanted to
1	I was disappointment no one came to clean the room on the 2nd day
1	I used one of my shirts to cover the pillow because the place was dirty and not sure I wanted to put my head on their pillow
1	Glad I only stayed for a few hours
1	Glad I only stayed for a few hours
1	Also , upon checkin , they assessed me an extra 1500 fee for my dog even though that fee was not disclosed on Hotelscom or the Super 8 hotel interconnect on Policies that is part of the Hotelscom website
1	I am very disappointed that the janitor took my personal face cloth and the bath tub drain looked like a scorpion and there was dust on the bathroom wall , air conditioner , and furniture and most importantly just because I booked my room through 3rd party they did not give me a receipt which is not
1	Although cheap , I was still disappointed especially since it still reeked of smoke even though we requested nonsmoking
1	to share your opinion of this businesswith YP visitors across the United Statesand in your neighborhood
1	We stayed for four days and had a great , relaxing time
1	We went as a couple , but could come back with our children There 's a kid 's club and some of the rooms have direct access right of the back door to a canal system that connect to one pool
1	If you walk down the beach , five minutes away , you will end crossing a nude beachhotel
1	We upgraded to a swim up room , which was fun for my 10 year old
1	They had inexpensive activities like paddle boarding and kayaking available , of which we took advantage
1	My only complaint would be that I had trouble with the Wifi , which I paid to have unlimited access to , but it seemed spotty and inconsistent
1	I would happily stay here again , with or without my little one
1	The positives Awesome lobby and checkin , resturants above average and 5 to choose from room service all hours beach is lovely and close very clean resort close to cancun airport reasonable workout area Negatives   staff always seems to be angling for a tip the cabana boy mafia controls all the ebacj spots and you have to play their tip game to get a spot clothing optional swingers beach is next resort down the beach no shuttles to airport or cars to rent to drive to nearby puerto morelos way too many kids and children over spring break
1	Not 1 1618 year old boy for my daughter to socialize with expesive wi fi is not part of all inclusive
1	The front desk and management we dealt we were very poor
1	Every simple request required multiple phone calls , and they placed us in a room directly across from daily construction which lasted past 8 pm on two occasions , even though we had an infant with us who needed to nap and go to bed early at night
1	When we asked a manager if we could change rooms , she declined and told us it would end at 5 pm that day and there would be no more for the remainder of our trip
1	It lasted two more full days , and she conveniently had the next day off so we could not address it with her
1	Also , the checkin process was awful as they made us wait three hours in the hot and humid conditions for our room
1	I ca n't say enough about the staff at Blue , as they were extremely friendly and always went out of their way to put a smile on everyone 's face

1	Visst var vi glada fr att det inte lg i Cancuns hotell zone men efter ett tag kndes hotellomrdet litet
1	All inclusive implies programming , but trust me , they customize things to please their guests
1	We made our reservations a month in advance , my wife called on the day we are suppose to check in , gets the run around of whether or not they will have a room or not
1	Who runs a business like this When they found a room we were given a couple cards , neither of which opened the door
1	Overall , you have no feeling of security , even if you are parked next to your room i was constantly checking outside on my vehicle
1	If there 's no hotels available you 'd be better off staying in your vehicle showering a truck stop
1	They treat their customers like crap , walk in your room wout permissionwaiting for you say anything , try to rush you out the rooms wthe doors open customers are n't dressed
1	If you leave your stuff in the rm they make you pay 25 to get it out wo n't give you a shuttle ride anywhere until you do
1	I told the van driver just a minute after she knocked she swung the door open claiming she did n't hear me
1	I told her I needed to get dressed she snatched the door open againx2 the curtains while I was getting ready
1	For 5 years now , I have been on very heavy doses of narcotic pain medication , and will be for life
1	It is very dangerous living alone , and I wo n't tolerate another human living with me
1	So , I have a specially trained dog trained as an alert dog to watch me and make my life safe to live
1	Last month , we my dog , Dana and I went to Ft Lauderdale , and we stayed at the Ocean breeze motel
1	After the grueling Chicago winter we have suffered 0809 , this motel felt like our home away from home , and we would definitely choose them if we ever would go to Ft Lauderdale again

1	When I was checking in , lady had a meeting or something to get to , so I felt like I was inconveniencing her
1	This Days Inn is located off the Strip which is what we wanted
1	It was still just a few minutes drive to anywhere we wished to go in Branson
1	The only complaint we had was that our room 's carpet was dirty , evidently from what the parking lot and walking surfaces had been paved with
1	We stayed recently just to take our kids to Silver Dollar City
1	Breakfast is a scrum of 1525 people trying to get at the food while you are dodging small children
1	FYI , the outdoor pool is open until 11 pm poolside rooms are fine if you are vacationing with teens or night owls , but if you have toddlersyoung children or anyone who prefers to go to bed early in your party , you may want to request a room on another side of the hotelpool party noise kept us up late the first night and we WERE the pool party noise the second night when we were n't worn out from traveling
1	and you can get small discounts on tickets to several attractions if you purchase vouchers at front desk
1	The only very minor serviceroom condition complaints we had were that one of the electrical outlets was pulling out of the wall , that we had to call to request replacement shampooconditioner the second night , and also when we requested pool towels shortly before pool closing , we were asked to go to the front desk to get them , as they could not bring them down to the pool towel cabinet for us at that time no big deal unless you 're already wet from the pool , of course
1	My family enjoyed our stay
1	I do have a few things to caution you of The continental breakfast is less than stellar , but it gets the job done Rooms by the pool are loud
1	The reservation was messed up when I got there and they had charged my card instead of letting me pay cash as first agreed on
1	And then the desk person refused to cancel the extra room even though I had not requested it and I had to do my own calling to get problem corrected and I am still not sure it is fixed
1	And it did not help to have a room for someone with walking handicap because I had to walk up an incline on the driveway to get to my room
1	I will never use hotelscom again nor will I ever stay at this motel again
1	I will stay again if we ever go back
1	When I woke the next morning , I could see sunshine coming through the edges of the door
1	While I was n't concerned for my safety , I did wonder how many bugs were coming to visit me during the night
1	The stay at this hotel was a good experience for me and our entourage
1	It has been years since I 've stayed in a Day 's inn but based on the rate and location I decided to go ahead and book my room there
1	The only bad thing I can say about my stay was the fitted sheets for the king size bed did n't fit and I had to keep waking up to put them back on
1	I m 6 ft and I had a hard time washing my hair
1	Any taller than 5'7 , you will have some trouble showering here
1	Other than that , I would of given this hotel a 5 but I would stay here again
1	Was so glad they have football channels so we could was our team win
1	I definitely appreciated having the ac cranked up when I walked into the room , especially since it was 100 that day
1	If I was you I would never go without shoes in the room the carpet was so nasty
1	My wife and I stayed here recently on our first visit to Branson
1	Would be a good central location if I was staying with my whole family also
1	I would stay here again and I will recommend it to friends and family
1	Dated and a bit worn , not to my liking and certainly not to my wive and kids either
1	We were given a room close to Lobby and over the pool , so it was a rather noisy room , but very convenient for our needs
1	I went to Branson for 4th of July so there were VERY few affordable options as every hotel raised it 's prices
1	So I was already paying more than I should beds and pillows were very uncomfortable and on top of it , they have a ridiculous pet policy
1	Our room was not ready until an hour and a half after check in
1	Then when we went to check out the next morning I waited 5 minutes or so before anyone came to the desk to check me out
1	I have to admit , I was a sucker for the large quantity , 12 oz , when shopping for hot sauces but now seeing the size of the bottle , it reminds of wingsauce bottle sizes
1	If I had seen the ingredients list I would not have bought itbr Jalapenosbr Waterbr Vinegarbr Brown Sugarbr Lime Juicebr Fish Saucebr Cilantrobr Habanerobr Garlicbr Spice Blendbr Saltbr Potassium Sorbatebr Xanthan Gum
1	I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality
1	My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than most
1	If you are familiar with the story of CS
1	Lewis ' The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe   this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch
1	If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it
1	I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered which was good and made some cherry soda
1	My only complaint is there was a bit too much redblack licoriceflavored pieces just not my particular favorites
1	Between me , my kids , and my husband , this lasted only two weeks
1	I would definitely recommend you buying it
1	Right now I 'm mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass
1	I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too
1	My dog eats her required amount at every feeding
1	We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away

1	Just realize that once you taste it , you will never want to use any other saucebr br Thank you for the personal , incredible service
1	I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy , and the proteinrich , no byproduct food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump
1	My cats have been happily eating Felidae Platinum for more than two years
1	They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food
1	Unfortunately , I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat
1	Six pounds will be around for a while with my son and I
1	I love eating them and they are good for watching TV and looking at movies
1	I like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so I can take my time eating them
1	I am very satisfied with my Twizzler purchase
1	I shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them
1	Twizzlers , Strawberry my childhood favorite candy , made in Lancaster Pennsylvania by Y   S Candies , Inc one of the oldest confectionery Firms in the United States , now a Subsidiary of the Hershey Company , the Company was established in 1845 as Young and Smylie , they also make Apple Licorice Twists , Green Color and Blue Raspberry Licorice Twists , I like them allbr br I keep it in a dry cool place because is not recommended it to put it in the fridge
1	I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me
1	We 've bought these many times from Amazon because we 're government employees living overseas and ca n't get them in the country we are assigned to
1	I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas
1	He loves these , and apparently his staff likes them alsobr There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16ounce bag , and this was well worth the price
1	I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality has n't dropped in all these years
1	I have lived out of the US for over 7 yrs now , and I so miss my Twizzlers
1	When I go back to visit or someone visits me , I always stock up
1	All I can say is YUMbr Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer , more often than I 'm able to buy them right now
1	I would never buy them again
1	I was so glad Amazon carried these batteries
1	I have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size
1	I need them for my garage door openerbr Great deal for the price
1	I got this for my Mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake , and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake   she 's the one with the sweet tooth   they both LOVED these toffees , you would never guess that they 're sugarfree and it 's so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free
1	i was so impressed that i 've ordered some for myself w dark chocolate to take to the office so i 'll eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweetsbr These are just EXCELLENT
1	We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away
1	When we realized that we simply could n't find it anywhere in our city we were bummedbr br Now , because of the magic of the internet , we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of itbr br If you love hot sauceI mean really love hot sauce , but do n't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat , grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan

1	However , my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato
1	No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products , too as a usually noncoffee drinker
1	McCann 's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it
1	It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issuebr br McCann 's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product
1	One thing I do not like , though , is McCann 's use of thickeners
1	Great on a cold morning when you do n't have time to make McCann 's Steel Cut Oats
1	McCann 's Instant Oatmeal holds its texture , has excellent flavor , and is good for you all at the same time
1	This is the best instant brand I 've ever eaten , and a very close second to the noninstant varietybr br McCann 's Instant Irish Oatmeal , Variety Pack of Regular , Apples   Cinnamon , and Maple   Brown Sugar , 10Count Boxes Pack of 6
1	McCann 's Instant Irish Oatmeal , Variety Pack of Regular , Apples   Cinnamon , and Maple   Brown Sugar , 10Count Boxes Pack of 6br br I 'm a fan of the McCann 's steelcut oats , so I thought I 'd give the instant variety a try
1	I found it to be a hardy meal , not too sweet , and great for folks like me postbariatric surgery who need food that is palatable , easily digestible , with fiber but wo n't make you bloat
1	I love McCann 's instant oatmeal   all flavors
1	I WAS VISITING MY FRIEND NATE THE OTHER MORNING FOR COFFEE , HE CAME OUT OF HIS STORAGE ROOM WITH   A PACKET OF McCANNS INSTANT IRISH OATMEAL
1	HE SUGGESTED THAT I TRY IT FOR MY OWN USE , IN MY STASH
1	SOMETIMES NATE DOSE NOT GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO SAY NO , SO I ENDED UP TRYING THE APPLE AND CINN
1	AND COFFEE AND A SLICE OF TOAST AND YOUR READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLDOR THE DAY AT LEAST JERRY REITH
1	I ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter
1	She 's happy , I 'm happy
1	The variety packs taste greatbr br I have them every morning
1	At 030 cents per meal , I do n't understand why everyone on earth is n't buying this stuff upbr br Maple and brown sugar is terrific , followed by apples and cinnamon , followed by regular
1	You do n't get tired of the same ole thing , and they taste greatbr br I just boil water from a small pot , empty the packet or 2 in a bowl , pour in boiling water , and watch it expand to 2x its sizebr br Taste really good and takes minutes to preparebr br Not sure why everyone on earth is n't this
1	It 's all good , that 's for sure , and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regularbr   This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored , as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann 's and other wellknown oatmeals
1	What I personally like about McCann 's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America
1	The Apples   Cinnamon , though , tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add
1	In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twentyseven seconds , so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to usebr   The only bad thing   if you can consider it a bad thing   about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you 'll end up with six tencount boxes
1	This is good if you have a whole family of oatmealeaters , but if you 're a single person alone   well , love oatmeal
1	I have McCann 's Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost 300 per boxbr It is a great product
1	Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon , but we find that none of these are overly sugary
1	We really like the McCann 's steel cut oats but find we do n't cook it up too oftenbr This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenientbr Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing
1	It did n't pass muster with my kids , so I probably wo n't buy it again
1	Though I would n't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste
1	That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of
1	However , I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand   they are both mushy
1	Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller , and the advertising workedlol , I tried them , and shared them with 2 buddies , and we all loved them
1	They are Hot , but not burn your mouth forever hot its a nice temp
1	I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp , Cranberry Horseradish Sauce , Fartless Black Bean Salsa , Apple Cider Jelly , Newton 's Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrupbr br Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts
1	They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms
1	They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work
1	I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence , especially my colleague Greg
1	I 'm going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can , and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I returnbr br The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed
1	It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyesbr br You 'll go nuts over these AssKickin ' Peanutsbr br PS
1	I 'm not sharing the peanuts , not deliberately , and I 'll probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas
1	I roast at home with a stovetop popcorn popper but I do it outside , of course
1	On numerous occasions , we 've had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much
1	Halloween is over but , I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share
1	While the assortment was good , and I did get this on a gold box purchase , the price for this wasbr 34 less at Target
1	Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags
1	I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form
1	Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder , not overly tasty , but quite effective , as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides
1	Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a salty taste , you get a refreshing lemonlime or mango
1	I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes
1	This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ridebr I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor no aftertaste and I actually like the slight carbonationbr I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line
1	For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thingbr br Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat
1	One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of themvoilaproblem solved
1	br br I 've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using thesebr br These guys got it right   they are superbly formulated and simply work
1	I purchased the Mango flavor , and to me it does n't take like Mango at all
1	I 've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades , so I 'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I 've tried
1	It 's not terrible , but it 's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take
1	If you 're impulsive like me , then 6 is ok Do n't get me wrong , the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints
1	In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I 'm lying
1	So I bought 10lbs    These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick , but nothing to strong
1	I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting
1	I am a pastry lover and these were the best I 've ever tasted
1	You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who can not digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience
1	I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugarfree chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell
1	I thought I 'd found sugarfree chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in
1	Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit , all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate
1	My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugarfree popcorn at my local market
1	The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy , new sugarfree treat taste so good , my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener down to the very bottom of the label and read maltitol in tiny little letters
1	In case you 're like me ,   it 's not you it 's the maltitol
1	I would not go out of my way to buy it again
1	I left them in my pantry for a few days , and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey
1	I through them in the fridge and I 've been breaking off hunks ever since
1	They taste good to me , but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again
1	I wo n't order them online again , but if I see them in a store I would pick them up
1	I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer
1	If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor
1	i know i can not make tea this good
1	granted , i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet
1	My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl
1	I 'm 30 now and I love it
1	I purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much , they kept them and would not eat them
1	I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy , but do n't let that scare you off
1	I use it to make my own coffee creamerbr br I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet   but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat , and honestly , I hate to use manufactured food items
1	I really do n't think they are good for the body
1	On the other hand , I hate using cold milk or cream , because I like HOT coffeebr br I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer
1	You will have to play with the ratios   I would not do just the heavy cream , it made the coffee too rich
1	I like mixing 13 of each togetherbr br For flavoring , I bough cocoa bean powder , vanilla bean powder , and caster superfine sugar
1	I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers
1	If you wanted , you could use a fake sweetner powder instead
1	I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars
1	I also use my little food chopperfood processor to blend everything , so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom
1	Let it settle for a bit before opening the top thoughbr br This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors
1	I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolateorange mixbr br All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online
1	Also , would make great housewarminghostess giftsbr br I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it , and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking   but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great
1	While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food , for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice
1	I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help
1	The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly , but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again
1	However , when given to my Boston , who has severe reactions to some food ingredients his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night , scratching
1	I guess you have to try each , until you find what 's best for your pet
1	We have three dogs and all of them love this food
1	We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him , no more hot spots or tummy problemsbr I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping
1	She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has
1	After we got the test back , we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand
1	So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this
1	She still has her environmental triggers , but I am happy she can finally eat something I know wo n't cause her pain
1	My shepherdcollie mix has IBS
1	This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it
1	I will always buy it from Amazonit 's 10 cheaper and free shipping
1	Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell
1	She has awful food allergy 's and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that did n't have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to
1	She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice she seems to like that better
1	We started feeding it to our other dog a Bichon too and she loves it
1	If your dog has allergy 's or stomach issue or if you want your dog to eat better food this is it
1	You will see a difference in your pet
1	I have switched them to a different food due to price a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance
1	This is great dog food , my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him
1	I have a 3 year old and a puppy
1	The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping
1	My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I 've ever met
1	After experimenting with various types of food , I have found she loves natural balance
1	I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it
1	Furthermore , I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring , so I figured why not
1	I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smellsbr br Additionally , I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco did n't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans
1	I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save 20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazonbr br All in all , I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food
1	While I have never eaten it , my dog seems to love it
1	Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains
1	My 112 year old basenjijack russell mix loves this dog food
1	He 's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year
1	Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods , I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full
1	On the normal dog foods , he 'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day the recommended serving for his size , whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 112 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day
1	When you take this into account , you 're actually getting more bang for your buck with the natural dog foods since you do n't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods and a healthier , happier dog , to boot
1	Add in the fact that you can get free , 2day shipping with Amazon Prime
1	The cheap ' you can buy it anywhere ' food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets
1	My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3
1	The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him Iams Lamb and Rice and onto a new kind
1	I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it
1	He would n't eat it , and when he did , it gave him terrible diarrhea
1	The mouth says , How do I love thee , let me count the waysbr If you like apple products a must have item
1	My husband loves these , but I 'm not so crazy about them
1	They are just too sourtart for my taste
1	I 'll eat the crust and hubby takes my filling
1	My kids think they 're great , so maybe it 's just me
1	My husband and I both love them , however , as another customer put it , they are expensive to ship
1	I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed
1	My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes
1	Hence , when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out
1	I 'm going to order the six pack and I 'm a household of one
1	Oh my goodness , when a friend introduced me to this exact brand , I could n't believe how great stuff tasted
1	I loved it so much I bought the six pack
1	I 'm presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods
1	Well , I 've always liked asparagus anyway and I 've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus
1	Now this is my idea of a good diet foodbr br Gary Peterson
1	I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried , but was diappointed in this specific one
1	I 'm so glad that I can buy it now from Amazoncom
1	I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee
1	I have been drinking Royal King 100 Natural Organic Green Tea 100 tea bags x 2 g each as my every day tea for several years now
1	For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night
1	But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me
1	I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together
1	I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit
1	In my opinion , for the price , Royal King 100 Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas
1	I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea although I would if I could afford itbr br Cons On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped
1	So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not
1	It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually do n't get as many boxes as I did with this merchant
1	I depend on my green tea fix everyday
1	It helps curb my eating during the day
1	My Mom and I have given it all friends to try
1	I 'm Italian and I lived in Italy for years
1	I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso
1	I could n't find them anywhere here in the Bay area , so it 's great to have them again
1	In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy
1	They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then
1	They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy
1	It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazonbr br Note it is great to open a bag , smell the contents , pour a glass of milk , then dip the Macines in the milk
1	I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store , then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively
1	The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor 's request , but he totally refused it
1	He still consumes too many calories , the fatty , but at least I know he 's eating good food
1	Of course , I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market , but I just ca n't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there , marketed as being healthy
1	I 'll stay with this for now , but stay tunedbr br I 'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats
1	I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them
1	Garfield still eats a little too much , but he 's just a big cat who does n't exercise much , let 's face it
1	Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she 's so healthy
1	I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select , but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one
1	I 've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it
1	I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his spunk so I decided it was time to start buying him real cat foodnot the garbage in the super markets
1	I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices , and I 'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase
1	My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he 's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft
1	I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals
1	I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat , and this is an excellent food
1	They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step , which is very important to me
1	The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select
1	This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight
1	She does n't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price
1	I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections
1	I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food with water added to it and Uri Ease
1	The combination seems to keeps his UTI 's under control
1	If I switch to another type of dry food , his UTI gets worse
1	Before I was educated about feline nutrition , I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food
1	I always offered both canned and dry , but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food
1	I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats
1	The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova
1	After once again offering several samples from my local holistic pet store Holistic Select was the only one other than the usual Wellness and Innova they would eat
1	For finicky cats , I recommend trying Holistic Select
1	We tried them all , but my cats prefer this especially the sardine version
1	AND and I do n't want to be rude , so I 'll say this as delicately as I can their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores , which is a definite plus for me
1	The health benefits are so obvious   I highly recommend Holistic Select
1	Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book
1	I 've been a fan of Hot   Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time
1	If you enjoy spice , and love ramen , you 'll love this product
1	It 's only 336 per 12 at my Walmart
1	I 've been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid , and I 've never found a better flavor than Hot   Spicy Chicken
1	I LOVE spicy ramen , but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation does n't go away for like 3 hours
1	Not sure if that is healthy or not   and you can buy this at Walmart for 028 , way cheaper than Amazon
1	Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal , finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in
1	I must be a bit of a wuss , because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste
1	If you are n't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough
1	Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup , which is half the price of my local grocery stores , plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors
1	These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you ca n't escape for a real meal
1	This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale
1	i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon
1	I do n't eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison
1	For the convenience of having it delivered to my home I have prime , so I get it in two days and do n't have to pay for the shipping , the price on amazon is n't bad at all , but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store
1	The BEST investment I 've ever made for ginger
1	I 'll be getting more soon   I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies
1	I can not get Australian ginger where I live
1	This compares favorably to Australian Ginger I 've purchased in other cities
1	My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement , Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him
1	I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried
1	He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning
1	I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on
1	Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brandbr If you can get these for 2 to 250 a package with free sh it 's a good dealbr The black and cherry have good taste but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there
1	Infact , I think I am addicted to thembr Buying them in packs of 6 bags   is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag
1	They 're soft , easy to chew , and they do n't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car , in the summer , at the beach , etc
1	Being a fan of Newman 's Pineapple salsa for quite a while , I was looking for a comparable salsa
1	They do n't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces
1	The SALSA smelled delicious , as I think it probably was   but , unfortunately , the person , at AMAZON , that is a packer there is probably several had very little stuffing to work with , especially on the bottoms
1	As I reached for my computer I was told NO RETURNS cause it 's a food item
1	I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag and I found none on their NEW FACE LIFT
1	THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUTTHEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES
1	LIKE I BUY A LOT OF STUFF AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES
1	NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGSbr ESPECIALLY SALSA   IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT
1	These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon
1	They 're kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product
1	But my finace really loves them so that 's where the three stars come from
1	I love to use it for chicken , either baked in the oven OR on the grill
1	This has enough flavor   flair , I 've even used it for dinner parties , only to receive rave reviews from my guests
1	Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself
1	I 'm not sure why Amazon is selling it for 999 for a box of 24 singles
1	such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you
1	I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here
1	Evidently it 's only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall , I could n't find it anywhere in town
1	This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam
1	span classtiny Length 026 Minsbr br spanThe expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product
1	This is one of the many items I reorder on Amazon every month or sobr edit added a short video , so you see what this combination looks likebr br I was wearing one of those headlamps , but I did n't do a good job focusing on the tunabr I should film it over , but it does n't look like many people view this product anyway
1	I 've never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches Starkist and Chicken of the Sea
1	I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning
1	these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion   make a great on the go snack , and really satisfying with the tomato
1	I have always purchased StarKist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace
1	Excellent quality , and no need to ' dress it up'br br I put it the micro on about 20 power for 1 minute and Shazambr br I believe a little heating brings out the flavor
1	I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it
1	I have n't made anything with it yet , just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent
1	I do n't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere , but they were so old that they would n't cook
1	I had to throw half of them out , because the skins were damaged , a clear sign of dried beans past their prime
1	Unfortunately , they taste nothing like banana runtsnor do they even taste good
1	The item over all was fine , but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smaller
1	I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme
1	If you want more than 25 small bags , I would purchase a larger bag
1	I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine
1	I am French and live in the US , br and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity
1	Savora is another hidden gem you can bringbr back
1	I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious
1	I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that , I love this product
1	I could n't wait to try the 88243 Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs , creamy sour cream , Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel
1	Now , I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes , but , let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really takes the cake with size , price , quality and tastebr The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition
1	I could n't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast , for three days
1	Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you 've got the perfect breakfast treat
1	I used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 56 years ago
1	This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going
1	I thought these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad
1	When the season for fresh lemos is out , this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshmentsbr br I will continue buying it
1	I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every daybr br I will buy this product again and again
1	If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommendedbr br I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation
1	After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another placebr br Love this stuff
1	I bought these at Grocery Outlet here in the Seattle Tacoma are for 400 a case of tweleve not paying 3800 Yes 3 for a dollar
1	WE have been looking for natural ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule
1	I drank half the first night and that was plenty for me
1	After about 30 minutes , I was ready for bed
1	I woke up refreshed and with no sleepydrug hangover , so that is a huge bonusbr br I gave the product 3 stars instead of the 5 it deserves as their packing job was marginal at best
1	We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic
1	And an added bonus   the high protein and fiber level I calculate 23 g fibercookie fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lowerbr br I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it
1	We had trouble finding this locally   delivery was fast , no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores
1	They harden up at room temperature , hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart , and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through
1	Personally , I do not like cheesecake too rich for me but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous , I will admit
1	Cherries , strawberries or sliced mangos are nice , but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons , that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cakebr br I use a base of sponge cake , baked in a shallow form , but other bases can be pate sucre a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie that works well in those fluted , straightsided forms
1	You can also make minitarts in a muffin pan , prebaking each mold with a layer of pie crust even commercial crust works , though again , I prefer pate sucre , it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb
1	Some people put a layer of creme patisserie , which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour , below the fruit and I happen to think these taste bestbr br If you get into baking , this glaze is a musthave on the shelf
1	The ingredients are vegan tapioca starch , carrageenan , dextrose , cream of tartar , locust bean gum , so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake , you can use this on top , as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base
1	My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone
1	I 've only had it for a few days and for 5 its totally worth it
1	My sisters all take ganocafe but now I 'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee
1	I will follow up on this product in a few weeks
1	Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better   I bought this to try something other than these two , but I probably wo n't get this again
1	Another one of my favorites , if you want to try it out though NOT organic , is ' Africafe pure instant coffee '
1	I eat 2 of these after lunch because they are so small and I find this sufficiently resolves the problembr br They 're sugar free sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow which is great and they 're tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunchbr br This is a good bulk value buy and I 'd highly recommend the mints themselves
1	I like these better than the regular Altoids , but they 're even more costly , so you 'd better like them
1	These little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great dealThere perfict for on the goFifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary alongAnd there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugarThe price of twelve dollars was very resonableAlso there great for shareingIf you are looking for a mint try these onesYoull be glad you did
1	Prosbr packaging , shipping , pricebr sold about a year before its expiration date enough for me to eatshare 9 boxesbr not too fresh like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form
1	Be careful not to eat too many of them in one day , as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a LAXATIVE
1	Even with small containers , they do n't fill them up
1	I love , and use the empty containers for medicineadvil in my purse , desk , suitcase
1	Tiny and powerful without burning my mouth
1	My mother in law likes these and Walgreens quit carrying them
1	It was great i could get them on Amazon
1	I keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to
1	Some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet
1	When I find someone who keeps coming back for more I just give them their own tin
1	One coworker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes
1	Like I said , they re a real hit
1	Since I would n't be able to keep my hands off a candy dish , this is a good alternative to have around and it 's nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch
1	I gave the item 4 stars because they are n't as tasty as the sugar version of the mints but what sugar free item is as good as it 's full sugar counterpart
1	and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove although I totally get why they wrap it   it still does n't make it easy to deal with
1	It 's full , but compactbr br I have n't run out yet , and probably wo n't for a couple months , but I ca n't wait to buy it again
1	I loved these Wintergreen Altoid Smalls so much , I had to come write a review
1	I definitely prefer them over the regularsize Altoids and will continue purchasing them
1	I use them as favors and everyone loved them
1	Driving cross country , if someone cuts me off , I turn to my daughter with my hand out and say Wintergreen Me
1	She pulls one out , puts it in my hand , and all is right with the world
1	I 'm not a dragonbreath person , but still , one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath
1	Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while   maybe 15 minutes
1	we have fed our cats a lot of stuff
1	They loved the Purina
1	They loved the Nutro
1	They love whatever we feed thembr br This review is based on what we , their affectionate owners love
1	Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they did n't have to chew it to swallow itbr br This Felidae has done the trick
1	We 're now loyal Felidae consumersbr br Additionally , the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with catallergies
1	I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it
1	I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which   she ate the Felidae and left the old food
1	She 's now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now , off the old food entirely , and she is a much sweeter , happier cat
1	I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested , or something
1	In any case , I am a happy purchaser of Felidae
1	We have three cats , the youngest is about eleven years old , another is fifteen and our oldest is , well ancient
1	When he lays down , he looks like a footstool
1	The other two are arthritic and skinnybr br Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs , I figured that we 'd give it a try for our cats
1	I 'd had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problemsbr br Buster , the youngest , is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats
1	However , the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really feeling better since we changed their food to Felidae
1	Even Prissy , the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her , where before when she was on Purina One , all she wanted to do was to sleepbr br I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems , it 'll be more effectivebr br However , the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life
1	We worked this kibble in over time , slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junkfood brand until the bowl was all natural
1	As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae , and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues
1	br br Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home
1	We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal
1	It has been a year since then and they are better
1	Then the formula for this food changedbr br We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us
1	We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food
1	Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and have n't suffered one bit like our dogs havebr br Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating
1	We have 5 rescued and fixed cats , none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formulabr br I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal
1	As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals , and tell me not to buy it
1	I ca n't even remember the first time I tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but I have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite
1	My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us
1	It definitely makes you sweat a bit when you 're eating it
1	It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I do n't think I would buy it again due to the heat
1	We prefer the milder McCormick 's brand of Fajita mix
1	I 've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it was n't as spicy as this mix isbr br If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind
1	To me it was more than medium hot but not by too muchbr br I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it 's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it
1	You take a plastic bag , a couple of tbs of vegetable oil , 14 cup water and mix the seasoning , water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes
1	In the meantime , it says to stir fry your veggies peppers and onion but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I do n't think it affected quality or taste
1	I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oilbr br I have one more package of this to use and next time I 'm going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more
1	A friend who 'd been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago
1	Even took me over to the store and bought me a pound
1	I 've been drinking Earl Grey , English Breakfast , Irish Breakfast , Lapsang Souchong , Assam , etc
1	Aside from the Lapsang Souchong , I think this is a great replacement for all the rest
1	My current favorite afternoon tea
1	Unless you 're extremely jaded or a tea snob , you 'll love it
1	I drink this tea plain without sugar or milk , and it has a pleasant aromabr br The price from Amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store
1	So the label Imperial Blend kind of implied the herbbr br I am not exactly a black tea drinker , so this tea is a surprise , and affordable too
1	I usually prefer White Chinese tea , like White Peony , but it is more expensive , and requires lower temperature water
1	I 've tried a variety of Ahmad tea
1	Not because I particularly like this brand , but they are just easier to come across
1	The Imperial blend , I believe , is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones I 've tried
1	I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea , and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced
1	I buy the threepacks as needed from Amazon and go through them rapidly
1	My family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too , try one box of it and you will love it too
1	I think I have tried just about every Bloody Mary mixer on the market at one time or the other
1	I use 12 and12 with V8 for a milder version , or the best is a Bloody Caesarbr Half mix , half clamato
1	I started drinking the power slim tea when I was on the HCG diet to help curb cravings
1	Since I liked it so well , I tried some of the others and I am now hooked
1	They are so satisfying that I drink them all the time
1	The Energy gives you that extra pickmeup in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day , no matter how long
1	I 'm trying several of the Wu Yi teas
1	I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day
1	i can not live without this citron falksalt , it is wonderful on watermelon , fish , almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does
1	You 'll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this
1	The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker   which is not bad , except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese tastebr br What was a HUGE disappointment
1	The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2 smaller all around   leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreadsbr br What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and ecofriendly packaging
1	They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers
1	The other crackers like Sesame Tarragon give you a littlebr more bang for your buck and have more flavor
1	I have been hunting , training , showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years , with multiple National Champions
1	I have been highly satisfied with Eukanuba 's quality and the results I have obtained feeding their foods
1	My recent purchases are with WAG , through AMAZONcom
1	Their prices are the best I have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock
1	The recommendation when we bought our puppies lhasabichon mix and lhasapoodle mix was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned
1	This is a somewhat expensive food so I ca n't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed homebr br Let me just say this , I have had small dogs before
1	Usually when they 're sitting on our laps but , you know
1	They 're dogsbr br When we got through the first bag of this stuff , we purchased more on amazon
1	It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of I think a 15 lb bag at Petco
1	I mean , they loved the food , do n't get me wrong and they loved it more when we 'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food
1	Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I 'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down ca n't blame the food itself for gluttonybr br Eventually , we switched their food
1	I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful they said up until 1 year
1	Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow
1	Granted , they do n't like it as much , but we humans like it a whole lot better
1	A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertastebr br In the 20 years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed
1	The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the yearsbr br I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here thanks Amazon
1	because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away
1	The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb much cheaper than I can find locallybr br This is a great tasting tea , which I am happy to recommend
1	If you like the Ceylon tea variety , you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this teabr br I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here thanks Amazon
1	and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20 years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed
1	The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the yearsbr br The current deal for the pack of 4 is very good cheaper than I can find locallybr br Highly recommendedbr br NOTE This listing 's description is confusing
1	I 've been enjoying this tea for years
1	My local store went out of buisinessThanks Amazon
1	I have done it in the past 25 years and it 's a habit of mine
1	Ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and I highly recommend it if you like black tea
1	I think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so
1	I have tried it out despite the other review and I found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either Russian or Italian groceries
1	I 've been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years , usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas , where many MiddleEastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas , usually at 57 for a pound box
1	So , you get a lot of tea for the money , but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags , they are not that much worse
1	If you want great packaging , forget it   they ship fast , and the kups are just tossed loose in a box
1	Once you 've tried some random sampler packs and now are overloaded with decafs , extra bolds , or teas , this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want
1	Received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what I ordered
1	This was my second order and I 'll be ordering this item again
1	a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavorsa few i ca nt find anywhere else so def worth the price
1	If used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack
1	I 've just been mixing a 14 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great , but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next
1	I think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well
1	I 'm excited to add more of the SuperFoods to my diet in this fast and easy way
1	Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem
1	I have been using this product for over a year
1	I use it maybe once a week at the most
1	I drink 12 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how I feel
1	IMO this does n't replace my am coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when I start to fade
1	I 've been drinking Guayaki Yerba Mate teas for years
1	I felt energized within five minutes , but it lasted for about 45 minutes
1	I could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money
1	Yes , it 's probably healthier than 5Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if you 're looking to avoid a caffeine overload , this is still not for you
1	I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL   probably lower than other unhealthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands bc they contain too much caffeine andor sugar
1	If you do not react well to caffeine , Guayaki is not a good buy either
1	I definitely feel an energy boost w 1 full Guayaki shot but not w out all the other caffeine side effects   irritability , nervousness , moodswings
1	Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee
1	Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your bodyweightbr br Side note   if you want to feel energized during the day , have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy , fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy
1	I loved the Roasted Almond , Roasted Pecan and the Peanut Butterbr br I will definately buy from this seller again
1	I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues
1	When I called to report the situation to the company , Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab
1	Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund , including shipping
1	This product has a strong aftertaste of Crayola crayonsbr br I am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes
1	Upon opening the plastic container , the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room , and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in itbr br I suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as I have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchasedbr br To date , my favorite coconut oil is distributed by Barleans
1	Had this shipped to my sister who follows a glutenfree eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets
1	These are healthy and my mixed Llasa , Tibetan Terrier adores them
1	And they are healthy and his breath does n't smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products
1	A great healthy chew for my 9 wk old beagle , Rio
1	He loves the taste and it sure beats my arm
1	Once I found it I look no further , it 's the only sugar I use
1	I have used and liked Sugar in the Raw for many years , after being introduced to it in a Starbucks
1	I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar
1	When they get a better crop , I 'll go back to purchasing Sugar in the Raw
1	Sugar in the Rawtm Please Harvest Cane wo Burningbr To be delivered to HCSbr Dear Sugar in the Raw folks , br br We who buy your product care about the environment
1	And we 'd like to know that you care too
1	When you burn the cane fields on Maui , it adds to the CO2 and worsens climate change
1	And the smoke from your burning is damaging the lungs of your workers , your workers ' children and the residents of Mauibr br We love your product and want you to change to noburn harvesting so we can continue to buy it , knowing we are n't contributing to Global Warming and lung diseasebr br
1	I also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar
1	I used to buy this sugar for years
1	I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar , and other brands in the local food store that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or somethingbr br HOW did i find out
1	I needed just a sweet water few days ago
1	The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS
1	U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as wellbr br I 'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice
1	But if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it , or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it , it is a great product
1	Use this in your coffee , cereal , etc for a week and you 'll never go back to white sugar , white sugar will taste terrible
1	Plus from what I 've read , this Raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our dietsbr br The product was delivered fast and wellpackaged
1	I wish I could find Raw sugar cheaper
1	I would be happy to buy in bulk , but this is the cheapest I have found
1	I thought this was a great buy , but as noted by Scott D , the molasses content was not up to par
1	Unfortunately what I purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and I have twelve 24 ounce bags
1	I guess I 'll watch for the next crop
1	We 've used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good
1	It did n't look like the box was damaged so I ca n't tell how it happened , but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I opened it
1	Not sure what the solution is and I 'd order it again , but if it happens again , I 'd switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag
1	My spouse and I buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious
1	Or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill
1	I 've had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty
1	I 've served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them
1	It 's also nice to have something glutenfree for friends who are borderline diabeticbut I would eat them anyway
1	I found these crisps at our local WalMart   figured I would give them a try
1	They were so yummy I may never go back to regular chips , not that I was a big chip fan anyway
1	I only buy it on special occassions because I know I 'll eat the whole bag
1	I paid 179 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today
1	I bought them because brown rice is a good carb
1	As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients
1	I wo n't buy these again   I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste
1	I use the Rotel Mild and I LOVE this product so muchit saves me on a daily basis
1	If you 're trying to cook lower fat , healthier foods and in a HURRY , this stuff makes it so much easier
1	It tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans , heat and eatbr br or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup
1	I also prefer this to most canned salsas , so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid offbr br None of my local grocery stores carry it at all , nor do they carry anything like it
1	So I have to pay Amazon 's inflated price to order this by the case
1	I do n't like that I 'm paying a higher price , but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the product
1	i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for 1
1	however , it 's only ONE dollar at the local grocery and    twenty eight dollars per twelve pack   these are running almost two and a half dollars eachbr br as i said , TOO EXPENSIVE
1	sigh   i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local costbr br take care , br lee
1	Nothing wrong with the product , but I sure had to mix it with lots of other ingredients to make it edible to me
1	In Texas I was called a babymouth   not into very spicyhot foods
1	1 can of this milder Rotel , mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes , was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips
1	For the record , I 've had 5 hour energy , and that tastes FAR worse
1	Red Bulls a day for the caffeine , and this gives me far better energy , and is much more subtle
1	My preference is black coffee , but I ca n't drink 812 cups a day anymore
1	Overall , Steaz does it right real organic ingredients in moderate amounts , and they create big results
1	I have to get up really early to work out before work and I get super tired by the middle of the afternoon
1	I was drinking one 5 hour energy , usually extra strength , each day
1	My husband got me to try this and I was skeptical , but for me it works as well if not better than the 5 hour energy and does n't give me that jittery almostheadache feelingbr br I do n't mind the tasteit reminds me of the inside of a fig newton mmm
1	At my grocery store they were almost 3 each , yikebr br And it 's organicso I can feel good about it , right
1	I bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there
1	He takes one in the mornings and works hard all day
1	I am a energy junkie and I 'm not sure if this works or not , but what I do know is that the taste is not the greatest
1	I do drink the steaz energy drink and I think I get the same results
1	If you want an organic energy shot , your choices are this one from Steaz and the assorted flavors from Guayaki
1	Guayaki Yerba Mate is actually in the Steaz energy shot and energy drinks , and they both use Sambazon Acai , so there are some similarities in ingredientsbr br Great energy burst for 4 hours on a Steaz Energy Shot , and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards
1	This will help me cut down on my iced coffees , which are not helping my calorie intakebr br Already ordering 12packs on subscribe and save , 2 per month
1	I was looking for a natural energy shot that works , and I found it
1	Steaz energy shot is my favoritebr br I recently had gastric bypass surgery , so tons of sugar is a nono
1	And I 'm also allergic to Sucralose Splenda so most other energy drinks are outbr br I tried Bazi energy shots and they did n't work as well as Steaz , and definitely did n't taste as well
1	These have a taste that 's almost like CocaColanot bad at allbr br If you 're looking for natural energy , give these a try
1	I had tried both of the Guayaki energy shots and I do n't like the taste of either of them
1	I like them cold for sure
1	My husband and I take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we do n't have to make stops for coffee
1	We normally split them
1	I 'm really sensitive to caffeine , even the natural kind so I get a little weird if I drink the whole thing but that 's the same for coffee too for me
1	You can feel good about putting this in your body
1	I 've been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon
1	So , I asked the nice lady at the counter of my local Whole Foods Market , for something that will give me that extra energy I need to get through the daybr br She excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle
1	Over three hours after drinking whatever that was , my brain is still working at unnatural speeds
1	To summarize my experiences I believe this worksbr br She did explain that I needed to drink plenty of water with it , which I personally feel helped the energy level
1	So if you 're feeling tired during the day and hate coffee , give this a shot   preferably before you eat anythingbr br Woot
1	It had a terrible aftertaste at first , but now that I know what to expect , I am getting used to it
1	I am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy I need without all the chemicals found in other beverages
1	It 's helped me kick my addiction to Diet Coke and other aspartamelaced caffeinated beverages
1	I 've tried 5hour energy , red rain , NOS , and other energy shots
1	Sometimes I wonder what I 'm really putting into my body with some of the other brands
1	I purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years
1	I first found Steaz Berry Energy Shots at a local organic market
1	I bought two bottles , which cost just under three dollars each
1	I am very sensitive to sucralose Splenda which is in so many energy drinks these days I also hate the taste
1	I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners
1	I have several medical conditions , including fibromyalgia , which saps me of energy and causes intense pain
1	I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done
1	No caffeine jitters , even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottlebr It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores , so I started looking online for a bulk price
1	I am so thrilled to have found the Pack Of 12 on Amazon
1	I signed up for Amazon Prime specifically for this product , hah
1	I have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all , its also the best taste , others taste like medicine , this one has a tea fresh taste
1	I drive OTROver the Road truck and this helps to keep me alert
1	I 'm on a autoship which i like
1	My wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style
1	I moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training
1	I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an AWESOME Energy Drink
1	I use this product daily , and it provides a steady stream of energy
1	I 've been buying and drinking this for over a year now , and the energy boost is excellent , with a continuous , 6hour effect
1	I like 5hr Energy , I find Rain ok and so I thought I 'd try this product based on the reviews
1	I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched really
1	But worst of all , within an hour I was yawning and drowsy
1	I wished I could have used it for more than one occasion , but it did n't last
1	I did use it to make 30 suckers for my daughter 's first birthday
1	I would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions , but for the price it did n't matter to me that much
1	You HAVE to try the VANILLA Tootsie Rolls
1	I did and I am quite addicted , it is too easy to prepare , it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with
1	If you like this type of Couscous like I do , then give this one a tryIt can be eaten hot , room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors , it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed
1	I cooked the Couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time
1	So I decided to try good ole Amazoncom and selected this product
1	I know how I normally cook Couscous so tried 34 cup water to 1 cup couscousbrought to a boil and let sit , covered for 5min
1	I would n't even think of buying this product unless I know the price per unit
1	I love ordering whole bean coffee on Amazon
1	I like this so much that this my first product review
1	I have to say that I 'm usually not a big fan of flavored coffee , but I thought I would give it a try
1	When my husband started grinding it up , I could smell it throughout the house
1	I do wish it came already ground as I do n't have a grinder and use a blender instead
1	This brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time   I 've believe the company is local
1	I 'm particularly fond of the Turtle Sundae but all the flavors are good
1	I ca n't say that I 've had a bad onebr br As it turns out , it 's less expensive to order it from Amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local Walmart to get it
1	Try it , if you like rich , flavored coffee , you 'll like it
1	I consume about a jar every two weeks of this , either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip
1	It is hot , but after awhile the medium Salsa Suprema was too mild for me I thought maybe I 'd cut down how much I ate by going to the hot Salsa Ranchera
1	The similarly hot Salsa Victoria is a duller taste to me , I guess earthy
1	I do n't like to go hotter than this because the sauces I 've tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot this happens to me with Tabasco sauce , for examplebr br A drawback is La Victoria does n't make a larger bottle of Salsa Ranchera nor Salsa Victoria , nor do they sell them in   or Sam 's Club
1	service was great , but I meant to buy Swiss Chalet chicken SAUCE not the Marinade br br Love the sauce   have yet to try the marinade
1	Use frequently as we like to do Asian dishes at least once a week
1	Put this in my husbands stocking for Christmas and it was a hit
1	You get what you pay for
1	I can stick them in my purse and take them to work
1	I usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee , but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because I wo n't allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup
1	I think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from Amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping
1	Even though we are International Delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product
1	I could n't believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups but many of the Amazon creamer options both Coffeemate and International Delight had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packagingbr br That was not an issue here
1	Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen , one in the bathroom we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig   best idea my husband ever had , and one at work , with a reserve for whichever runs out firstbr br If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options , this is your best bet
1	The only reason I stop ording is bacause I went to sugar free , and at that time he did not have it
1	But for those of you that do n't have to watch there fat in take , I would get this product from them
1	They 're great because they do n't require refrigeration
1	I found these new spring PopTarts and bought them on a whim
1	My kids and I were amazed and delighted at the fun , colorful , amazingly detailed artwork on these PopTarts
1	Tie with a ribbon for a bright thinking of you this spring gift
1	I went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee
1	I paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money
1	I had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it
1	I throw it right away , i coudl not drink it
1	It may take me a while to finish the entire gallon , but I will definnantly order again
1	Bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months , and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat
1	I cut up cantaloupe , apple , banana even used sweet potatoes a few times just whatever I could get at the restaurant and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat
1	It 's great because I did n't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks , and he got to try out new foods
1	My son started using it around six months , and he really enjoys it
1	He DOES get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon , but whatever
1	Anyway , I also had trouble cleaning it , until I tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush
1	It takes some time , but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender , or cut it up , then clean it up off him , the chair , the floor , the dog , me , well you get the picture
1	My daughter love itbr I do n't think is difficult to wash , I mean , is not like just toss water and that 's it but , come on
1	I could n't get the food pieces out to save my life
1	I tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests
1	I loved this product for fruits and other food that I did n't want my new baby to choke on
1	I also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething
1	I love , love , love the idea of this product and my little one loves , loves , loves to use it
1	She gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and I do n't have to worry about her choking
1	Bananas however , have pretty much destroyed a couple of them
1	While I love this product , I think that next time I will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags
1	While my daughter was interested in it for a little while , she eventually lost interest
1	I may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts
1	I know a few people with little ones that use these and they LOVE them
1	I ordered these for my coffee themed wedding
1	When they arrived I had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good
1	They were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables
1	Unfortunately , I keep them in a candy dish in the office and they are going fast
1	I have been following Weight Watchers and lost 50 pounds and am at my goal
1	Whole Foods carries this item and it 's been on sale there for 999 that 's Canadian dollars , too , as I 'm in Canada
1	It 's even cheaper on Baker 's Box 's own website , and they 're the company selling this product through Amazon
1	I thought Amazon was where you could find competitive prices
1	The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India
1	I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than I 'd original expected
1	Just add to your sugary concoction be it a baking good , a dessert or a drink to either give strawberry flavor or add to existing flavor , and presto , just about everyone will be licking their lips and maybe fingersbr br For those interested , I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid
1	For really high end desires , I go with the Apollo Olive Oils from California
1	I had n't tried or heard of till recently Weavers not it 's my favorite
1	I am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and have n't found one yet , they 're all so darned smooth
1	Having always been a strict Peet 's Coffee lover , I was reticent to switch brands but Weaver 's won my heart
1	Go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of Weaver 's Peru Organic Whole Bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee
1	And when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they do n't know better , take along a travel mug filled with Weaver 's coffee from home and enjoy a real Cup of Joe
1	As a Peets Coffee fanatics we learned that Weavers roaster was the roaster for Peet 's and we are hooked
1	I already reviewd the French and Organic blend , but I must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drinkbr Met the weavers team at the Warner Brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast
1	Since them we are fansbr You wo nt be dissapointed
1	I like eating these whenever I need an energy boostbr It has everything that I am searching for in a , To Go Snackbr Fiber plus Chocolate is never a bad thing
1	My fiance loves these dark chocolate and nut granola bars and all the grocery stores around us do n't carry them anymore
1	Once again , Amazon came through and he could n't be happier
1	I was buying Quaker Oats granola bars but these Nature Valley chewy bars are better tasting , they make a great snack when I 'm on the go
1	Now , I came keep the husband 's breakfast ready as he runs out the door in the mornings
1	Nantucket Blend coffee is one of my favorites
1	Green Mountain Nantucket Blend KCups make a very good cup of coffee in my a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB000AQPMHAKeurig B40 B40 Elite Gourmet SingleCup HomeBrewing Systema
1	This is a very smooth tasting brew that my wife prefers over the a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB0029XDZIKCoffee People , Donut Shop KCups for Keurig Brewers Pack of 50 Amazon FrustrationFree Packaginga I generally drink in the morningbr br These are good on both Small and Large cup settings as wellbr br Highly Recommendedbr br CFH
1	When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas , we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors
1	Of the 12 pods we had in the box , four were Green Mountain Coffee brand
1	I 'd never tried anything from this company before , but from what I had researched online , they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as wellbr br Unfortunately , I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee
1	We tried their Dark Magic , Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming , to say the least
1	I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogtherbr br We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of wastenotwantnot , I figured I 'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely
1	And I 'm glad I didbr br The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee
1	It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent unlike some of the other GM blends we tried
1	I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our goto Caribou Blend pods
1	All in all , this is a very standard cup of coffee which , while it is n't anything new or exciting , is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we 've been able to test out
1	When we run out of all the pods we 've accumulated , I 'll probably pick up a box of these as wellbr br Now that I know Green Mountain is n't completely disappointing I 'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB004I3Y4IEGreen Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast , KCup Portion Pack for Keurig KCup Brewers , 24Counta to try as well and see how it goes from therebr br If you 're looking for a goto choice , this is your cup
1	Green Mountain is my favorite brand
1	Nantucket is my favorite coffee from Green Mountain
1	I was looking for a replacement for Timothy 's Kona Blend which is no longer carried on Amazon
1	This coffee from Green Mountain is very nice , but not strong enough for me
1	If you like milder coffees , then this one is for you
1	One of Green Mountains best blends of coffee in my opinion , love it for your everyday blend , perfect stregnth , excellent blend
1	This is just Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup , the best I have ever eaten , with large hearty chunks of chicken , and vegetables and nice large noodles
1	I am so glad Amazon carries this product
1	I just ca n't find it here in Vermont
1	I have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking , I love the regular , I use it on everything
1	You wo n't be sorry you tired it , great for dipping bread and cooking omelet , and green beans
1	Like most people , I 've been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it
1	The refreshed taste of this Ketchup is a great update , and now leaves me disappointed when I 'm given Heinz while out at a restaurantbr br For you Heinz die hard fans out there , this is not the ketchup for you
1	But for those of you who wish you always knew what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste found in Heinz , be sure to give this Ketchup a trybr br Do n't forget the spiced variety
1	Purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first Sir Kensington experience is definitely the way to go
1	It is so good I have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy
1	I have been using porcini mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years
1	The Roland extra fancy porcinis that I purchased from you are the best that I have ever used , including the mushrooms that I bought in Italy and transported back to the USA
1	While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones , the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus
1	Additionally , I find the broth used to rehydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews
1	To save time and add flavor , I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without rehydrating them
1	The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroominfused waterbr br This was the first time I used the Roland brand got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse , and would certainly buy them again
1	If you are a peanut lover , these are for you
1	Six people on my Christmas gift list ask for these every year
1	They made an absolutely excellent cashew brittlebr br My order took just over a week to arrive , which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country
1	They came double bagged in clear plastic bags , and in two 5 lb portions
1	This was highly convenient since I could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until I was ready to work with itbr br Great value for the price
1	I mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they do n't have to look perfect anyways
1	For the price , they are a great deal about half of what I find them for in the store
1	I will admit , I was a bit sceptical when I ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good or bad the cashews would bebr br The order came in pretty fast   like 3 days
1	They were in 2 5 lb bags sealed with clear tape first I found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal considering the second pack stayed fresh till I opened them
1	The trick is to actually keep them in an airtight box so that they stay fresh longerbr br The only negative I can think of is that the price went up abt 500 for the 10 lb since I bought them
1	I bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that I have at a couple of restaurants
1	I actually ordered 3 cans instead of the gift tin , so he could take one to work , or his place , and stay fresh longer
1	Although I do n't think freshness will be an issue , they wo n't last longlol
1	My cat will go for a day , probably longer , have n't tryed it , but he 'll walk right by this stuff every time , even when I know he 's hungery
1	I swear he 'd rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it
1	I have used it in Ham and beans and seasoned greenbeans
1	I did not realize this when I ordered it and can not return it because it is a food item
1	Before I discover this mix on Amazon I always bought it in Whole Food Storebr I like this mix and when I am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffybr Just one small secret Try to add the Seltzer water instead of regular one
1	I appreciate the fact that I can buy this product online and have free shipping
1	Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake mix is my favorite mix
1	But we have a lot of fun with this Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake   Waffle Mix
1	We serve them as is with fried eggs and REAL maple syrup , a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB002483TSQButternut Mountain Farm Vermont Pure Maple Syrup , Grade A Dark Amber , 1 Pint Juga , or with warm strawberry jam and whipped cream , or Cool Whip , or add brown sugar to the mix to change the flavor and make a crispy waffle , or add 14 cup sugar and 14 cup malted milk powder a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB001EQ4HVCCarnation Malted Milk , Original , 13Ounce Jars Pack of 3a , for awesome gourmet pancakes and waffles like they serve at the Hilton
1	Its handy to have extra bags on hand , too , and you ca nt beat the Subscribe and save price
1	We are glad we found this mix as we make pancakes without eggs for my son who has an allergybr They taste fine for our family we like them many ways
1	I love the flour however Amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess
1	I had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth , it 's that bad
1	I 'm not even sure I would cook with this
1	It is subtle and sweetIt 's one of the better chamomile teasbr If you find it hard to sleep at times , a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may helpbr If you really like sweet taste try Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Teabr I highly recommend both
1	In the past I used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch , chocolate chips , Oreo cookies , caramel et al , because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale
1	Now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the Santa Cruz Organic Mint Chocolate syrup really stands out but does n't overpower the flavor of the ice cream
1	And because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste , I use it sparingly , so this 155 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups I used
1	There are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are
1	I use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half , tastes great
1	I sent a case to my Mother recently diagnosed with Diabetes , and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties
1	I ordered this product at the same time as the Kirkland Signature salmon
1	Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water approximately half a cup , it 's not enough for a good cup of tea , so I use two
1	Sometimes little out of the way stores have itBut i also love the chicken , pork chop bagsEvery store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market
1	Our local grocery went out of buisness and so I could not find this product till I looked here
1	All of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but McCormacks bland and tasteless seasoningsbr br This is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find
1	If you like Oreo 's or the Oreo cakester , then you 've got to try the Double Stuff cakesters
1	I was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when I told them I bought this
1	Last time I looked , it was 25 a 500 g jar in British stores in LACounty , or about 4x what it costs in England
1	The Amazon supplier was quick and efficient , and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year or would have , if I did n't decide to send one of the two jars to my son in Japan
1	I put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried
1	I am going back to Nature 's Path Buttermilk pancake mix
1	The only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast
1	The cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery storebr br I have no complaints but I also now have no more cookies
1	We ate them all
1	I was not expecting to like these cookies as much as I do
1	I like chocolate chip cookies well enough , but I really prefer a soft cookie to crisp ones
1	I have to say these Famous Amos cookies have pertty much turned me around
1	They are n't fattening and they 're good for you , right
1	Great if you are cutting back on fat , they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them
1	I have never met a Kettle brand chip I did not like
1	After buying bags one at a time at a hefty markup at nearby stores , I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon
1	I was very pleased with the price and the productsbr br These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy they have a slowbuilding spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag , which I 'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few timesbr br The chips arrived wellpacked and fresh
1	They had nearly a year of time before they expired , which is pretty impressive for chipsbr br Most importantly , the priceperbag was much , MUCH better than any local store could do , although I live near an expensive city , so that may play a role in the price differencebr br I would n't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out
1	one of the best chips that you can buyand i 've tried all the kettle varieties , and many others
1	Perfect with a sandwich or alonebr If you like being addicted , these are the chip for you
1	We eat Kettle chips by the truck load at my house , we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite , never enough bags to get us to our next shipment
1	I just wish Amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save
1	If you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself
1	I have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day
1	Kettle chips are the BEST nonbaked chips I have eaten
1	I decided to try the sweet onion chips , since I 've never had them
1	I will definitely reorder these , as I mentioned above , they are the BEST I have ever eaten
1	I can not say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips
1	Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors , and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water
1	I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB0048IFUSCKettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato , 2Ounce Pack of 24a and the Jalapeno flavor
1	They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I 'm fine with since I 've a vegetarian
1	I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I ca n't guarantee how many I will have left
1	My fiance and I love these
1	I love Kettle Brand Chipsbr I 've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavorsbr br Sea Salt   Vinegar Chips are TANGY , SOUR , and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time
1	br br Personally , the flavor is too much for me , but my mom   aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips
1	I absolutely love them
1	I like to buy these smaller bags because I ca nt trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good
1	I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change
1	I love these chips , I buy the 24 pack once a month
1	I could still do with more vinegar flavor , but I think this is as close as I 'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myselfbr br I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful
1	Additionally , as other reviewers have said , they have quite a good bit of potassium in them somewhere in the neighbor of 15 RDA per serving
1	I have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a yearI love them , but my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favoriteWill be ordering them
1	These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant
1	I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart no way
1	Honey Dijon flavor okay flavor , but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste
1	I 'm not a fancy cheese eater , and it lingers for at least an hour
1	I 'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5br br We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor 4 stars , which we both liked better , and they did n't leave any longlingering or bad aftertastebr br I 'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars
1	The chips are crunchy , but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips
1	For me , Kettle is the best brand on the market
1	I did n't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips , but these are my new favorite
1	I hope they come out with a low fat version their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors
1	These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly
1	What I like about thembr 1 Very thick chipsbr 2 No trans fat and all natural , according to the info on the bagbr 3 Flavor , but that 's a subjective thingbr 4 2 oz bags , which keep you from eating too much at one time
1	What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them
1	I usually love Kettle Chips , and love salt   vinegar , but these chips were way too vinegary for me
1	They do have the typical kettle chip crunch , but are too aggressively flavored for my taste
1	I have always been a fan of Kettle chips
1	When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality
1	These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the packagebr br The New York Cheddar chips have a very subtle flavor to them
1	You can taste the cheddar in them but it does n't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might
1	The taste lingers as well which is a definite plusbr br Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp , that crunch in your mouth
1	The flavor is great and you wo nt ' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover
1	These used to be my favorite flavor until I tried their Salt and Pepper kind but I 'm sure this is just a personal preferencebr br Crunchy , real potato chips
1	I subscribed to these   one case every three months
1	That comes out to about 5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want
1	Because it seems FritoLay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items FritoLay wants me to have
1	The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway for example which I find works very well   they 're large enough to be a good snack on their own , or you can even share a single bag over lunch
1	I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption
1	I took the plunge as I do like salty , and tangy flavors
1	No , I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price
1	They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date FEB 2011
1	Umm , I 'm in the middle on these chips , they are OK but not something I ca n't live without
1	They are a little too vinegary for my taste , which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hardboiled eggs and pickled pigs feetbr br I have n't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience
1	My husband and I LOVE these chips
1	I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store , Lunds , but they were on sale , so I bought a bag
1	Tried the Thai or asianinspired chips by Target , Archer Farms , and they were awful
1	These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesomeso much so , that I 'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon
1	As a professional potato chip muncher , I see these as thee very BEST on the market
1	These are handsdown the absolute best Salt   Vinegar chips you can buy
1	They have a great , strong flavor that has left me addicted
1	I highly recommend trying them
1	And they 're so hard to find where I am , and when I do find them , they 're usually 12 more per bag for less
1	When I buy a larger bag it 's harder to resist eating them all
1	In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips , from the best I 've ever had to big disappointments
1	If you have eaten the LantChips varieties , there is no way that they are not the best as a group the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products
1	If wou are strong at will , or having a large BBQ go for it , but as for me , i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days , had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it
1	They have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time I end up tearing down the entire side of the bag
1	We bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in Sonoma while we were on vacation
1	I was n't sure what to expect by the package , and at first bite I did n't know what to thinkand then all of the flavors hitbr Yum
1	They are n't sold everywhere though , I 'm still trying to find them somewhere close to where I live
1	I have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive
1	I ca n't stop eating them
1	Believe me , some chips are so salty , I ca n't finish a small bag
1	They sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands
1	These will be the only chips that I buy from now on and I thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time
1	I 'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors , so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt   Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber , carrot , celery and cherry tomatoes
1	Skip the dip balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetablebr br As an Oregonian , I 'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends , especially those living outside our state and who have n't experienced gourmet chips
1	I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beerbr br Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakablea light gold color , rich flavor and amazing crunch

1	Solomon wrote , you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing
1	Other brands I 've tried use too much mustard flavor , which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairingbr br These chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans , coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat
1	Naturally , they also go down great with beerbr br As an Oregonian , I 'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends , especially those living outside our state and who have n't experienced gourmet chips

1	These chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school
1	They are by far the tastiest chips I 've had and it 's impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag
1	These are by far my favorite chips , they are extremely crunchy similar to other Kettle style chips , but it 's the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks
1	I 've tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close
1	They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut
1	I much prefer the salt   pepper just for the krinkle cut   they have a better texture
1	All around this brand is much better than FritoLay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping
1	These are similar to Tim 's or Zack 's chips in that they are very crispybr br On a side note , these are the hardest bags to open by hand
1	It took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you
1	They sure were eaten all up by my family and friends
1	The best thing was that there were a lot of brown chips in the bsg my favorite , so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends
1	I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty , and the onion flavor is better
1	If you have n't eaten Kettle chips before , I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk
1	We are always pleased with Amazon 's packaging
1	I love them
1	My children and their friends love them
1	Even my 4 year old loves them
1	They are hard to find in Vegas and are my favorite flavor
1	fantasticyou can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover
1	Once I would open a bag I could not stop
1	I do n't eat many chips , but these I love
1	Expiration date is a ways away , so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor
1	I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends
1	But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind
1	Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I do n't have to buy them from the store anymore
1	I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked
1	I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly
1	For some reason Amazon would not ship these to Alaskaso I sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them
1	They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy
1	They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture
1	I really love Kettle brand chips , but these are rather disappointing
1	I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste , a bit oily and overcooked
1	It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB000G6Q4GMKettle Chips Spicy Thai , 2Ounce Bags Pack of 24a
1	It is obvious the chips are flavored , but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor
1	And I love New York Cheddar
1	A good chip even when overcooked , but I do not plan to buy them again
1	I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring
1	Then all of a sudden , within seconds , it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy
1	We love Kettle Chips Lightly Salted and do n't feel guilty eating them
1	We used to buy them at Whole Foods but buying from Amazon has saved us money
1	A friend of mine brought these into work with the claim , these will change your life
1	While my life is fairly unchanged , I can not get enough of these chips
1	try these anyway , they may convert you
1	But if you happen to , like me , there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip I 've found in this country
1	I do n't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I 've ever had , but they do
1	They 're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c , which could be because they do n't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normalbr br And if you like these , all of the Kettle chips are great
1	i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them
1	i recommend them
1	How can you go wrongbr br Obviously , not for you if you do n't like spicy food
1	But , if you DO like spicy food , you 'll probably love these
1	Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet , savory and spicy everything you 'd want in a good meal or better yeta potato chip
1	They are , however , sliced just perfectly , not too thick , not too thin , so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off
1	If you like any spice at all , these really are not overly spicy , so most people can handle them
1	Okay , I should not eat potato chips , nor should anyonebr But these are so spicy , I would find it hard to eatbr very many
1	I do n't write very many reviews but I have to say that Kettle Brand chips are the best I have ever tasted
1	If you are feeling iffy about honey dijon , I would recommend cheddar beer , absolutely amazing
1	besides a lil fat I have eaten a lot of chips in my day and Kettle takes the cake
1	I bought these for the office and no one can put them down
1	I 'm ordering more today and it has only been 2 weeks
1	Did n't have to shop for them either , Amazon brought it to my door
1	It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me
1	They are my favorite because I can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt
1	Amazon 's suggestion for a 4 star review is I like it
1	That being said , I gave a 5 star review to the Spicy Thai chips
1	We like the ones that have Sea Salt
1	We also like Barbeque flavored
1	They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth
1	The sea salt ones , which are a favorite , have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chipsbr br Enjoy
1	They came when you said they would
1	Odds are that you will have them to yourself
1	If you like your fish and chips soaked in malt vinegar , you will love these
1	The best salt and vinegar chips I have ever had and I love this flavor , mind you
1	Since I have found that SV is palatable to only the most intelligent of our species I know that my afternoon snack is all mine , unless of course I run into another heavy brained , hearty breathed like mind
1	Summary If you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wo nt pucker at the sight of these handily bagged morsels
1	It is the first and only time I have committed to a whole case of chips and I will do it again
1	I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED
1	I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain
1	They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you can not taste any of thatit 's annoying
1	I do not recommend this flavorsalt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite
1	These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouthbr br For my entire life Sour Cream   Onion and in this case   Chive chips were my favorite
1	So when I found out they had sour cream   onion I just had to try thembr br As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk
1	I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery , chalky texture on a chip , with a rancid and onion flavor and I have a hard time believing that person existsbr br I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them
1	Everyone I 've let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste
1	I 've yet to find a Kettle chip that disappointed
1	I love these chips , which is why I bought them , to stock up for the entire school year
1	This is the first time I tried Sea Salt   Vinegar chips
1	You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before
1	so run like you stole something over to your computer and order the SPICY THAI CHIPS
1	even if you paid the going price of 3000 , you are still ahead of the curve
1	I keep sayingbr br You ca n't go wrong with these if you 're a fan of the salt and vinegar classic flavorbr br 2ounce bags are about double the size of the kid 's bags about the same size as the ones in the small gas station racks
1	These were nasty , they were so greasy and too rich for my blood , plus they lacked major flavor , no spicy jalapeno flavor at all
1	I was so dissapointed in these chips , I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you , yuck yuck yuck
1	I wish I could give these zero stars if I could
1	If you like spicy , then these are for you
1	I like spicy , so I enjoyed these
1	These are decent , but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip , try Boulder 's Salt and Malt Vinegar chips
1	Each chip has the perfect thickness   my teeth get excited every time I put one in my mouth
1	Everything about these chips is so perfect , it 's like they were made by God and delivered by Gabriel himself
1	Now that I know Amazon carries these , I do n't even have to leave my house to buy them
1	If you like a lot of flavor , you 'll love these
1	I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe 's with my daughter Mindy
1	I could n't believe how tasty they were the best chip I had ever eaten
1	It was love at first bite , and I 've been munching them ever sincebr br Other things in their favor they 're thicker than other chips , so do n't crumble as I 'm devouring them they 're delightfully crunchy and the saltandvinegar combination is heavenly
1	Is n't that poeticbr br As for health values , since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation , I 'm getting more nutrition , such as potassium and vitamin C My mother would approve of that , and the fact that they 're handcooked in small batchesbr br I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea , but they 're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch
1	Well , actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything   except sweets , of coursebr br My only problem is that they 're so delicious I ca n't stop eating them
1	That 's the reason I chose these smaller packets I figured 24 could last me almost a month , if I was a good girl , kept my appetite under controland hid them from the kids
1	It is n't easy , but br br Have I told you how much I love thembr br Reviewed by Betty Dravis , 2008br Millennium Babe The Prophecy
1	OK , so they 're still a snack food , but no salt and no transfats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get
1	And if you 're on a lowsalt diet like I am , having these available means I can eat chips , and Kettle are just the best
1	These potato chips are excellentThere are no trans fatsbr br They taste absolutely deliciousWhenever I am in the mood for potatoe chips , Kettles is the brand I buybr br A great product that anyone should enjoy and I highly recommend thembr br Enjoy
1	It feels strange to review chips , but I am compelled because these are my absolute favorite chips
1	Kettle has lots of flavors but I always go back to these regular lightly saltedbr br They are thicker and sometimes greasy at the bottom of the bag , plus they often looked burned
1	I love to open a bag and find some browned chipsbr br Lays and Wise have their place but I 've become a chip snob thanks to Kettlebr br Like Edy 's or Breyer 's ice cream , some products are worth the money
1	If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth dentures you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand
1	I am dissapointed with all other Salt   Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft andor the vinegar taste whimpy andor chemically
1	I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy
1	I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan
1	About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket
1	I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it
1	After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to
1	They were all uniform whitish yellow in color , flavor was way off , the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed
1	So I emailed Kettle with the following What Happened
1	I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste It tastes cheaper
1	I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor
1	I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering
1	I did receive a reply Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand ® Chips
1	It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections , and we apologizeOur potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in colorbut our chips should still taste greatThanks for providing us with the best before code from the bag
1	This really helps when passing on your comments to our staffbr We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand ® flavors or nut butters , believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase
1	In case you buy this product again , we suggest avoiding the same best before date if you still have it in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same timebr Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks
1	Please let me know if I can be of any more help
1	Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the bad bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost
1	I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company
1	Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same
1	Someone brought these to a party we had last month and I did n't put them out because the buffet was full and did n't think anyone would like saltless potato chips
1	Last week we had some friends over and these were all I had in the pantry so I put them out
1	OH MY GOSH THEY ARE SO GOOD
1	I was so wrong to think they would be bland they are full of real potato flavor , wonderfully crisp and very fresh tasting
1	I am here on amazon to buy a case , I only want to have these with dips
1	Some Kettle Chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch
1	They arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from Amazon Grocery have been
1	I have tried Herrs , UTZ , wise , pringles , lays etcbut Kettle tasted the best
1	The quantity of salt used is the optimum which is requiredbr br Although they say serving size 1 ounce , you will finish the whole packet in no time
1	The first time I tried these , I thought , WOW
1	but I quickly found they were just too darn spicy and tart Hard to enjoy the potatochippiness of them when your mouth is under seige
1	I was eating some out of the bag , when I looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed
1	Then I started looking at all the unopened bags and MANY of them had this type same hole
1	The box they shipped in had NO holes so they we 're packed this way
1	Needless to say I 'll never be eating anymore Kettle products and expect a full refund from Kettle or Amazonbr M
1	Chilling in the fridge seems to boost the flavor even more and using them , rather than corn chips , to make nachos will have your tastebuds singing like Janet Jackson
1	When originally produced in England these we 're the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty
1	after opening numerous bags I found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them
1	I was getting VERY worried , when I read some of the other reviews here
1	Specifically , the One Star reviews , to which I always go , to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying itbr br WOW
1	They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS , BACKYARD BARBECUE 9OUNCE BAGS , PACK OF 12 , that I had bought as 1 ounce bags , liked A LOT , decided to subscribeand then , for good measure , got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bagsbr br YesI love potato chipsespecially these KETTLE CHIPS , BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOURbut others seemed to really HATE themor at least , hate how they had changedbr But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS
1	Also , as we 're all potatochip lovers , but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing , we are , here a sort of United Nations of Potato Chip Loversall different , but all united in our love of Potato Chips
1	The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightlyknit , but everer , expandinggroup here , I think
1	   But   not at first realizing that thesebr different flavour reviews were all together , did cause me a little confusion and dismay at least to begin with Amazon should have mentioned that this is the Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum
1	  br br I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS , BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR , are totally delicious
1	They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever hadthat was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even mebr These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle , however , have just the right amount of sweetness , with honey powder , onion and sugar , to take the edge of the stonger flavoursbr paprika , chili pepper , cayenne pepper , and natural smoke flavour , of which there is less , they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners
1	But as far as the potassium , energy   good , too much   bad for the kidneys , and the sugar and natural smoke flavour , too much leading to cancer production   the only thing is to do what is good in everythingM O D E R A T I O Nbr br Twice or three times a month , I allow myself to go on what I call a Potato Chip Diet
1	I eat only one large bag , or the equivalent in small ones , of potato chips all day
1	I supplement this with tea , coffee , and lemonade , as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials , I like the Dark Chocolate flavour This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat , if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks
1	It also teaches me to eat slowly , because that one big bag , or many little bags , never lasts as long as I 'd like
1	Anyway , with excercise and sensible eating , the rest of the month , and keeping my scale nearby , and weighing myself at least twice a day , every day , I 've taken off ten pounds in the last three months
1	Except for those jalapino chips , which tasted good , but were far too spicy for my own taste buds , I have yet to meet a potato chip I did n't like to eat
1	These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips , with their combination of potatoes , sweetness , and spices , have truly become one of my top five favouritesif not the VERY first favourite , of allbr br Flavoured potato PERFECTION
1	They 're not necessarily bad but they 're the kind of chip where you 're only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty
1	I 've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning
1	Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazoncom and this was one
1	I could n't stop eating them
1	They did n't last very longbr br The reason I gave them 4 stars , instead of 5 , is because I think the bags are a little hard to open
1	I 'm not sure why they need to make a potato chip bag that sturdy , you may need some scissors on hand to open them much easier
1	They are as good as the Kettle Brand once was
1	I 'll NEVER buy anything from Kettle brand ever again
1	Unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual pinches of salt and drinking actual vinegar , i doubt you will like these chips
1	These are the saltiest   sourest chips I have ever had , and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because I paid for 2 full boxes and do nt like to waste food
1	Unless you are the rare kind that can take this kind of extreme taste , you will not like these chipsbr br I actually have a high tolerance for sour taste , so I can down a bag of chips with a bit of difficulty
1	I bought this brand as a trial since I am tired of the Pingosbr br It claims that it is natural
1	So I just throw away all of them
1	I do n't know if I was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same
1	They are good but wish they were also baked
1	I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORSbr SALT   FRESH GROUND PEPPERbr TUSCAN 3 CHEESEbr NY
1	CHEDDAR AND HERSbr br THEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME
1	IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZEbr br I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS
1	I purchased these because of the low salt , and they were indeed low in salt
1	I will never buy these again , and I would not recommend them to others
1	If you are looking for STRONG SV flavor these definitely are n't for you
1	I live in TX and I can tell you I 've tried ALL SV chips I can get ahold of
1	From a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch , but if you 're looking for SV flavor these have just a touch
1	I do n't know if it was the case of chips we received or what , but everyone we allowed to sample the chips in a buffet style setting agreed that these were slightly on the salty sidebr One person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow , due to the amount of salt in thesebr br We had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the Lay 's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips , but these Kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact oppositebr br Sorry folks , we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty sidebr br We are still looking forward to Amazon finally getting the Lay 's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips in stockbr These got a 2 star , because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique
1	Even if they are trans fat free , they need to be a lot less greasy
1	Do n't waste your money on any of the Kettle brand potato chips
1	DEfintely not as tasty as the Madhouse Munchies which are my family 's favorite
1	I love sour food but this one I ca n't bear
1	I have loved Kettle Brand Sea Salt and Vinegar chips since the first time i tried them
1	The fact that i was able to find them online for such a great price , was wonderful
1	THey are a quick and simple snack for lunch and it goes great with my cold sandwich
1	MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free
1	Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them
1	They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they didbr br The worst part though is that they taste horrible
1	Instead of crisp , oily and full of charactersay as if they were cooked in likea kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays
1	Other reviewers who bought around the same time that I did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chipsbr br The chips came in a sealed Kettle box , so it 's hard to say who screwed up
1	After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5 oz bags to arrive , upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse
1	When my son gets home , I 'm going to have pictures taken and email to Amazon
1	I will never buy these again from Amazon
1	I can not tell you how disgusted I am with this purchase
1	It makes me sick to think about itbr br I included pictures at the top of the page
1	Poor little mousie must have high cholesterol nowbr br Update I forgot to mention that I offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to Amazon but was told they did n't want them
1	I give the Lord thanks every day for delivering unto me such an incredulously delicious blend of ginger and spice , a veritable cornucopia of flavor
1	I have actually changed my diet to a strict regiment of the Spicy Thai   Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors , alternating days
1	I have already lost 5 lbs , not to mention the myriad of other health benefits I have been experiencing
1	She calls them her sour chips and wants them in her lunch all the time
1	I love the crispy kettle way they 're cooked
1	I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together
1	Also , they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming careful
1	I can not believe this , I received this item and EVERY SINGLE BAG WAS OPENED BUT 4
1	I 'm stationed in Afghanistan and this was gon na be a snack for my team while going out on missions
1	After reading some of the reviews , I got nervous and opened a bag from my recent order expecting the worst
1	Kettle Branch Potato Chips New York Cheddar These are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty , on the burnt side , and taste rancid , either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old
1	I am glad I was able to find these on this site
1	I love this flavor and they are so crunchy
1	They 'll totally know it was you
1	With that said , they DO make fantastic plain chips
1	You wo n't regret itbr br Some people say they are burnt but they are n't
1	From their website Take a quick look and you 'll see an immediate difference Kettle Brand ® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold
1	But they explain that on their website At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower andor safflower oil to make Kettle Brand ® products
1	We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are trans fat free meaning none were detected
1	You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging
1	For those of us watching our salt intake , the unsalted chips is the best you can get
1	I first came upon them when I visited a CostPlus World Market store in Opelika , AL , in the Tiger Town Mall , in 2007
1	I was n't a big fan of dijonflavored anything , but I decided to give these chips a try
1	I probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months ' time
1	I searched all over my part of Alabama the northwestern part of the state and could not find them
1	I later tried to find them at the World Market in Hoover , at the Patton Creek Shopping Center , and they did not carry this flavor
1	However , when I learned that they were available on Amazoncom , and also available for PRIME Shipping   I bought them as soon as I read Kettle Chips Honey Dijon , 9Ounce Bags Pack of 12
1	They last quite a while , but I will reorder , very , very soon
1	I suggest you buy them , in this bulk form , and enjoy them   you wo n't be disappointed
1	They go great with hamburgers and hot dogs   so they 're perfect for spring and this coming summer 's outdoor activities and cookoutsbr br Take my word for it , these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods
1	Buy some today , and fall in love like me
1	I have never been addicted to anything in my lifeuntil I tasted these chips
1	I have tried other brands of the sea salt and vinegar flavor and they are just not the same
1	I 'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors , so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt   Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber , carrot , celery and cherry tomatoes
1	Skip the dip balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetablebr br As an Oregonian , I 'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends , especially those living outside our state and who have n't experienced gourmet chips
1	I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beerbr br Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakablea light gold color , rich flavor and amazing crunch

1	Solomon wrote , you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing
1	I bought these when on sale through Amazon
1	Definitely a great buy if you can catch them on sale
1	For those of you who , like me , had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally , you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed
1	I paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he did n't like the spicy thai , but these are fine for himbr br Yuck
1	I 'm not a big one for potato chips , so I am sure I 've come late to discover these
1	I think they are really good
1	They are thicker   more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we 've all come to know
1	I love these chips and now the whole family is hooked on them
1	If you like potato chips you will like these
1	Get em on sale when you can and limit your intakeif you can
1	If you 're looking at this you probably already know you like these chipsbr This is a great deal and I have not had any problems with them going stalebr The 1 oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid overeating
1	While I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive , I really think this one has gone too far
1	Skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these
1	I am surprised that they are still on the market
1	I have found this product , Kettle Chips Unsalted to be fabulous
1	I found them by accident on Amazon after hunting all over my local stores
1	When I saw the Spicy Thai chips , I knew i had to try them
1	I love spicy and I love Thai food , so why not
1	But if you absolutely hate sweet chips , I 'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet
1	Thank you Lord , for I have found another healthy snack food that is unsalted , and tastes great
1	The only thing i would ask Kettle to change is the texture
1	These are my favorite , but they are n't for everybody
1	They are a bit rich , so they are n't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking
1	Salt   vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so I think I 've tried every brand out there
1	I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy
1	You might , actually I 'm sure you probably wo n't like it AT FIRST BITE ' IF ' you have never had these before
1	If you love jalapeno chips then Kettle is a must trybr Nice and cruncy with the kick of jalapenobr Deliciousbr Addictingbr Recommended
1	My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago , and he and I have become addictedbr br First , Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc
1	But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would
1	Still , decent spicynessbr br All in all , I have been pretty happy with this product , in the few weeks since we first bought it
1	I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store
1	I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly
1	There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few casesboxes for just over 1000
1	I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there that way I did n't eat them all
1	As far as the pictures , if the person contacted Amazon , he made out ok Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon
1	If you like plain potato chips , you 'd like these
1	They are thicker than most brands , fresh out of box , very crunchy and not too salty for me
1	Part of the reason is that they are too oily some chips almost look transparent , if you know what I mean
1	If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice , except salt , as the name says
1	I do n't think I 'll buy these again
1	The best by date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October
1	I love this sea salt   vinegar flavor from Kettle
1	When I saw this one on the daily deal here for 1799case , I put my order without doubt
1	However , when I received the case , I found out that the whole case is expiring in December while I got it at the end of August
1	I tried one package and I can definitely taste the unfreshness in the chips
1	I was disappointed and then I found out this item is not returnable
1	Although I love this chips , I wo n't order from here again with the concern of close expiration date
1	This is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them
1	We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags
1	They have 0 fat , no preservatives , nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients
1	It 's simple Buy these chips , get them tomorrow , eat thembr Repeatbr br Whybr br Best old school BBQ flavor out therebr Kettle qualitybr Incredible price with Amazonbr br Did I mention delicious and a terrific bargain
1	I found these more than 10 years ago in a health food store
1	After I bought one bag I found myself stopping by that store once a week to get these chips
1	The New York Cheddar flavor is so good , you will have a hard time not eating a whole bag
1	I gained 5 lbs within a month of buying this 12 pack of full sized bags
1	They should warn you about this
1	When I finish my crash diet I will order another box case
1	They start off sweet , then as you eat more the spice builds up
1	If you do n't want to commit to a whole case , pick up a bag at your local Whole Foods first , then stock up here when you realize how amazing they are
1	On a side note , this brand Kettle Brand has many delicious varieties this is just my personal favorite
1	I also highly recommend Backyard BBQ , Honey Dijon , Sweet Onion , Buffalo Bleu , Salt and Pepper and Death Valley Chipotle
1	I 've eaten other brands of unsalted potato chips and they 've always been terrible
1	I did n't expect much when I bought these
1	But after I tasted them I was amazed
1	Kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips I 've tasted thus far
1	They are thick , has a bite to them and I love their creative flavors
1	My favorite Kettle chip happens to be the honey Dijon
1	I think it 's a great combination sweet , salty and tangy , perfect for one of those snack attacks when you do n't know exactly what you want
1	As an Oregonian , I make a point of sharing these Oregonmade snacks with friends who visit the state

1	Solomon wrote , you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing
1	I 've always liked Salt and Vinegar chips but most of the time the stronger flavor was at the bottom of the bag
1	My only concern is they 're very oily
1	I understand they 're kettle chips and they 're fried small batches and all but when you open the bag That 's another thing , very strong bag
1	They definitely are n't healthy , because I can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them , and I can see the grease at the bottom of the bag , toobr br They are highquality chips , and deserve to be put on your table
1	Kettle Foods , Inc makes the best tasting potato chips I 've ever eaten
1	With a variety of flavors , from classic Barbeque to their unique Spicy Thai you 'll find the right flavor for your mouth
1	And not only do they taste wonderful , but these allnatural chips are cooked in safflower or sunflower oil for zero cholesterolbr br But why is it a GoGreenMartMore product of the week

1	I did n't have to give up totally something that I truely love to snack

1	When you just got ta have some chips , Kettle Chips Lightly Salted chips are the what you 've been searching forbr br There 's no cholesterol , no trans fats , no artificial anything   and because of the manufacturing process , they actually seem to have kind of a homemade qualitybr br This is an excellent product
1	The New York Cheddar flavor is my favorite of all the Kettle Brand potato chips
1	Unfortunately , it may do the opposite to your backside , so do n't do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroombr br I still give it a 5 of 5 starsbr br Also , the online price at Amazon is better than anywhere else I 've seen them
1	Combined with Amazon Prime you 'll be getting a great deal on these chips
1	I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one
1	They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like thesebr br Price wiseI do not see that they are that much of a deal here
1	I purchased them for 299 at the grocery with no shipping
1	I ended up eating a whole bag a day for a while cause they were so good
1	I am glad that they do not have any dextrose in them like lays do
1	if you like honey mustard then you will definitely like this once you eat it you wo nt stopaddicting stuff
1	I do nt know if they were fresh or if they were supposed to taste like they did
1	I checked the expiration date it was current but still tasted kind of stale to me
1	But I love them
1	They are n't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually nonexistentbr br Here are the original and new ingredient listingsbr br Original Ingredientsbr Select Potatoes , Safflower andor Sunflower Oil , Honey Powder Evaporated Cane Syrup , HoneySalt , Garlic Powder , Jalapeno Pepper , Ground ginger , Onion Powder , Habanero Pepper , Dried Parsley , Citric Acid , Cilantro Extract , Ginger Oil , Cayenne Pepper , White Pepper , Lime Oilbr br New Ingredientsbr Potatoes , safflower andor sunflower oil , sugar , dried cane syrup , salt , maltodextrin , yeast extract , spices , garlic powder , onion powder , dried parsley , jalapeno powder , citric acid , natural flavors , lime extractbr br I 'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner , Blue Diamond
1	They might want to get rid of Great Taste Naturally from their bags as I do n't consider maltodextrin to be very naturalbr br Great job Kettle
1	I Was sent 3 week past Fresh by date stock
1	unfortunately I put a chip in my mouth before I saw the holebr br Very bad form amazon
1	I try to be good , but when I feel like indulging in some delicious , gourmet potato chips , these New York Chedder potato chips are the first flavor I like to go for , when I see them at the natural food store
1	I order these by the case of 12   and when they are good , which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip , THE BEST
1	and then I get a case of the worse   the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again , expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best   the last case is what prompted me to write this   the potatos were weird   like they were almost sour as in going bad   and I even wrote the company that makes them   SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try againbr I , myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring
1	I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle
1	I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that
1	Anyways , my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price
1	You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging , also
1	The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I did n't mind but they had tons of flavor
1	These chips do n't have any sour to them at all , and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste
1	If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first
1	They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants
1	We 've long enjoyed this brand of chip , so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find thesebr br   Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I 'm a confirmed saltaholic , generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans
1	The chips are a little greasy , and that 's why I 've given them 4 stars instead of 5
1	Kettle lightly slated chips are my favorite on the market
1	Thick , super crunchy and full of flavor , they are the best
1	They seem as salty as any regular potato chip , and they also seem excessively greasy
1	No trans fat , no cholesterol , no artifical stuffbr Low in sodium and high in potassium , which is great for people like me with HBPbr Only problem is Amazon is out of stock some times and price is high
1	Some people may not like thatbr br I reccomend them
1	My 8 yo is a Kettle chip addict so I was so happy to find snack size bags for his lunch
1	I could n't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing
1	Well , I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key
1	I do n't eat rippleridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth
1	This may sound rediculous , but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettlebrand jalapeno chips
1	At the time I placed my order , I could n't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked , and the Kettlebrand chips were packaged in a similarlycolored bag
1	But , it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettlebrand of jalapeno chips , and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games
1	When I run out probably sometime next year
1	, I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips , and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettlebrand chips
1	Imho , Kettlebrand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip ' affectionados'br br Sincerely , br br   § homiedog §
1	I 'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie 's are better IMHO
1	I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil which are both GMO , and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy , but darnit , these things bite back
1	On the plus side , the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many
1	I vastly prefer Lay 's texture , but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and cornsoy
1	I wish they 'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth , though
1	I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips
1	But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor at the bottom of the bag in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010
1	So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces
1	I knew my family already liked these chips so it was a no brainer to take advantage of a great price for good chips
1	The price per bag ca n't be beat if you order with subscribe and save and the good thing is you can always change the delivery interval if you notice you go through them quicker or slower than you anticipated
1	This is a delicious teabr br I 'm just now becoming a tea geek and really exploring the stuff I like , and Earl Grey is amongst the top , especially with bergamotbr br The problem I find is the amount of bergamot added is usually too little , or too muchbr br This one is perfect
1	I do n't add anything to this tea , just a part of a teaspoon in a cup and in 23 minutes it 's readybr br Tastes like an expensive tea but priced like Lipton
1	I bought this tea as an alternative to very pricey Teavana Black Teas
1	The tea tin is guarding the aroma very wellbr The taste is beautiful the Malva flowers do soften the taste and the amount of bergamot is just rightbr The first time I used too much tea and soaked it for too long I used as reference Darjeeling FTGFOP First Flushbr Since then I save on the quantity of tea leaves and soak the tea for only two minutesbr A delight the best Earl Grey I ever had

1	After a lifetime of tea drinking , I can honestly say that this is the best Earl Grey I have ever tasted
1	Do yourself a favor , if you like Earl Grey , and treat yourself to this tea
1	We love them
1	We would order them again
1	I have a German Shorthair Pointerand these treats are her favorite the organic peanut butter cookies are for smaller dogs , but she loves themand for weightcontrol I like them
1	My male Maltese dog had been enjoying the Old Roy 's Puppy Biscuits from Walmart
1	Then I could n't find them
1	I ordered six bags of the peanut butter and crossed my fingersbr br They arrived , and my little guy loves them
1	When he hears me touch the bag of treats , he beats a path to his crate in high excitement
1	They are a BIG hit with my him
1	They are high quality and I can even smell peanuts in them
1	It has helped make my husband feel lots better even though he is in early renal failure
1	I was depressed I was stuck with 4 bottles of this
1	It sat on my shelf and I forgot about it
1	Last weekend I tasted a Zevia cream soda and was not pleased with the flavor , it tasted weird and smokey like the LorAnn oil I had gotten
1	The odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeelbr br So I wanted to see if this would help the LorAnn oil too
1	Then I added ONE DROP of the oil , it is very strong , and stirred it in   IT TASTED SO MUCH BETTER
1	I whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treatbr br Now I will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream
1	We make up a coffee creamer with 14 part commercial coffee creamer , vanilla , butter creme , almond and Bavarian Creme flavors and the rest milk
1	I 'm from Detroit , and I was raised on Vernor 's ginger ale
1	Once I moved to California , though , I found it difficult to find Vernor 's
1	I guess without advertising , it just never found a homebr br I prefer the plastic bottles , but the ideal size is the 169 oz 500 ml or the one liter
1	The problem with the two liter size is that it takes one person me too long to drink it , letting it go flatbr br In any case , Vernor 's is unique in that it is aged in oak for three years , I think
1	That imparts a great , unique flavorbr br I wish it would catch on again , and become available more widelybr br Recently I did see it on sale in Redwood City in California 's Bay Area , south of San Francisco
1	I like Vernor 's , and drink it all the time
1	They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the costcutting mega soda companies use , rather than the cane sugar they used to use
1	The soda is also known , like other ginger drinks , for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomachbr Vernor 's is a regional soda , and there are many areas of the country you ca n't find it in
1	They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon , at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment
1	Search at Amazon for ASIN B001JK2SEG to see what I mean
1	I use Madhava 's agave nectar in my baked goods all the time , and am always pleased with the results
1	At the time I 'm writing this , Amazon was out of stock as a vendor
1	A little goes a long waybr br Using agave nectar Use 13 to 12 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener depending on your taste and the recipe
1	Most bakers might already know this , but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients unless beaten with butter firstbr br Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do , so you wo n't be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy
1	It makes everything moisterbr br If you are looking for less caramel flavor , you 'll need to use the light version of this product equally good in all applications
1	Very tastybr br However , I was expecting 46 fluid ounces , not 46 ounces in weightbr br I find that 46 ounces in weight makes about 32 fluid ounces
1	First time I 've ever used Agave Nectar   and it is great
1	Now if I could only figure out how to make tequila I would be set
1	The taste is the same , but it seems a little less sweet because I find I have to use more of it to get the right sweetness in my coffee
1	It does n't pour well , so I have to pour it into a better squeeze bottle , so that I do n't have a sticky mess on my counter every day
1	I continue to have it shipped to me every other month
1	It works great for cooking , baking and as a substitute sugar in my Chai lattes
1	I really like this product and taste great with the coffee or tea , and I have lost weight by cutting the sugar and replacing it with the honey and Agave nectar
1	We have been using 17Day Diet guided by LowGlycemic eating for about 67 months , with fair success
1	the one thing I have not tried it on still using sugar is making kombucha   I still use sugar , as I 'm not sure it would be a good idea to introduce a raw element into kombucha
1	But actually , that may just be my own overcaution and nothing related to actual chemistry or circumstancebr br Our primary uses are sweetening yogurt , using it in the little baking I do , and use in salad dressings , fruit desserts , etc
1	Because we are limiting our sweets consumption , we do n't use a lot of this , but it 's nice to have when we need it
1	I plan to try using it in some homemade jams later this season
1	I buy it on subscription , and the cost is about 33 less than the local WalMart and more than 50 less than the health food store on this same brand
1	Best by date on the bottles I received in May is 2015
1	I am so glad I was introduced the this brand of sweetner to replace sugar , this is so much better
1	I really like how it sweetens my herbal sweet teas without having to use too much , and how it can be used in place of pancake syrup too
1	Learning how to use it what the first thing I had to learn , once I learned how to use it , I became hooked
1	I highly reccomend if you want a clean fresh taste and feel to your foodsIf you do purchase this sweetner , take advantage of ship and save , it will save you lots of money in the long run
1	It is the best natural sweetener I have ever tried , and I have tried many
1	You can use also as pancake syrup or as a substitute for honey on your peanut butter and honey sandwich
1	I have been using Agave Nectar for several months now and have found it to be a staple in my home
1	Substitute this to sugar and you 'll be doing your body a great favor
1	I got mine very soon
1	I like the taste of Agave , cross between honeymaple
1	thank you for this product   we use it all the time and appreciate your promptness and the price was excellent
1	I am on a low glycemic index diet to help control my blood sugar and hormone levels
1	My nutritionist recommended agave nectar as a sweetener since it 's GI index is in the low 30 's as opposed to honey in the low 50 's and sugar in the mid50 's
1	It 's used like honey   substitute 23c for every 1c sugar and reduce liquids by 14thbr br I also use it in a carrot cake recipe equal substitution instead of sugar where I substitute whole wheat flour instead of white flour and I do n't decrease the other liquids
1	It 's delicious and you 'd never know that 's it 's actually good for you
1	I am very disappointed with this product because I could not see how many calories it has at the time I ordered it
1	I received it and now I can see it has 60 calories per tablespoon
1	I was out to dinner with friends   family at The Saloon in Rte 46 Entertainment Complex in Sanford FL
1	Besides having an awesome staff ask for Keith and fabulous food the escargot is a MUST they serve China Mist tea
1	This is the 1st time I chose the Tropical Organic Green   I have no doubt it is the best flavored tea I have ever had
1	If you 've tried the conventional Kettle crinkle chip verson Salt and Peper , you CAN'T compare these to those
1	I have become allergic to tomatoes , but I love tortilla chips
1	I prefer to eat them plain
1	They also have just the right amount of heat to make them flovorful , but not overpoweringly spicy
1	I have not had potato chips in approximately two years as it has been difficult to find organic chips
1	Amazon lowered the price on these , and I finally had a chance to order them
1	I most definitely will be ordering them again
1	My family and I love them
1	Try them you 'll like them
1	thesedon't like hot food they might be a bit much for you
1	Of course , Kettle Chips are just good chips   they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty
1	I also like that they are ridged chips   those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me   I do n't want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness
1	If you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips
1	Just the right amount of spice to make them hot and they are also sweet
1	My family and I are offically addicted
1	I think Plocky 's brand as a whole is a cut above in quality but I found these to lack in taste somewhat and be a little greasy
1	Everyone in our family loves them
1	I definitely enjoy the Kettle Sea Salt and Black Pepper
1	I just wish they were bigger bags
1	I ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service
1	If you like barbecue flavor , this is a nice sweetMexified barecuebr br I also like that it 's organicbr br I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes
1	But dang , if they 're not sinfully deliciousbr br Granted , 5 oz is not a whole lot it was skimpy for the price , which is often the case when it comes to organic , but it was 750 calories at a pop
1	At first you think that these chips are n't all that Spicy , but the spice will grow on you with each bite
1	I ca n't say enough good things about Plocky 's chips
1	I have purchased this flavor and the black bean flavor a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB000GWKO7GPlocky 's Tortilla Chips , Black Beans ' N Rice , 7Ounce Bags Pack of 12a and I love them
1	I have never eaten a tortilla chip that did n't make me feel guilty afterwards
1	I actually prefer these eaten by themselvesno dipsand I keep a bag in my desk at work
1	I have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something
1	I bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too
1	I am a fan of Plocky 's chips and will continue to purchase them on Amazon
1	My aunt gave me a bag of these and I was immediately addicted
1	I love the zip , agreed they are awesome without salsa , and no trans fat
1	I was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued Kettle flavor , but was disappointed when I opened the box and found this substitution
1	I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor
1	They can be eaten alone , since they are so crisp and tasty or with a dip
1	Every one that we have introduced the chips to , loves them
1	And the expiration date is for 8 months from now , so ordering 12 bags did n't come near to them going stale
1	I bought these chips , and wanted to try if they were tasty
1	But I liked this very muchbr br I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips
1	Used to get them at Henry 's in San Diego , CA before we moved out of there and have been ordering them from Amazon since
1	Ca n't always get them in local stores , they do n't keep them stocked even though we are always buying them out
1	The first time I ate these was at night and then even after brushing and flossing I could taste them in my mouth the next morning
1	So just be careful about when you eat them , especially if you will be hanging out with people later in the day
1	The first time I ate these chips was in Aruba in 2007
1	I could n't find them in our area CT so you can imagine my joy when I found them on Amazon
1	I love these and hope you continue to carry them
1	I pay 299 in Aruba and they run about 246 a bag when I buy the case of 12 through Amazon
1	Only problem is , now everybody wants them here and they steal my bags when the case comes in , but that 's oksharing is good
1	If you like salt   pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch , then you ca n't go wrong with thesethey are the tastiest bag I 've come across
1	The sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt , in fact I have trouble cutting myself off midbag even though I normally enjoy a low sodium diet
1	I would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 89 oz bags
1	I used to buy these at the local supermarket , but they are no longer carried there
1	Finding them on Amazon I purchased a box and found they were fresh and delicious as I remembered
1	I definately will buy them again
1	I shared a few bags with my daughter in Iraq
1	She said Ummm they are Good
1	They are good for you too
1	We like Plockysbr They like usbr Plockys Plockysbr Mean no fussbr Taste so goodbr And healthy toobr Plockys Plockysbr Grab a bag or twobr Thank you Plockys
1	I Love these potato chip they r soooo good
1	The best potato chips I 've ever had at the best price I 've ever paid
1	They are with out a doubt the best chips that I have ever had
1	They are the best chips I 've ever had
1	We ordered these only because the Black Beans and Rice , which we really
1	After about a week , we finally opened up a package and then kicked ourselves for not having tried them earlier
1	There is a little kick to them after you swallow them to let you know you have had a hint of hot pepper of some sort
1	We took them to a pot luck that night and came home with an empty bag
1	I used them , from another bag , as a garnish on a salad that I took to the pot luck and we came home with an empty salad bowlbr We will definitely order these againa hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB000GWLUGUPlocky 's Tortilla Chips , Red Beans ' N Rice , 7Ounce Bags Pack of 12a
1	I was first introduced to the Red Rice   Beans chips in my hometown of Bethlehem , PA
1	When I moved to North Carolina I was unable to find these chips in my local area
1	On my trips back home , I would buy a bunch of bags to bring back with me to NC
1	Then I discovered that I could order them online and life was great
1	These chips are my all time favorite and everyone that I serve them to loves them just the same
1	You just got ta try them   you 'll be hooked
1	If you do n't want to get addicted , do n't try Plocky 's Red Beans and Rice Tortilla Chips
1	My husband and I started with one seemingly anodyne bag from a store
1	Now , we 've just received our second case
1	My husband who , being Mexican , is very picky about his tortilla chips and I absolutely love these
1	He actually usually prefers a very hearty , cruncy chip Like El Ranchero , but the flavor of these is so fantastic that we 're both thilled with them
1	The bean , rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful , and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that
1	We go through an embarrassing amount of them
1	I never , ever like plain chips , but these I can eat without anything else , although they 're particularly amazing with a fresh salsa
1	a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB000GWLUGUPlocky 's Tortilla Chips , Red Beans ' N Rice , 7 Ounce Bag Pack of 12a I first tasted these chips while visiting relatives in KY
1	They are not available where I live , so I ordered them from Amazon
1	My friends and family are all addicted to them
1	They are even great by themselves
1	We will order these as long as they are available
1	Thank you for making them accessablebr br   Shelly Kenyon
1	I 'm a huge Tabasco fan , and I love unconventional snacks
1	But these do n't taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they 're made from I did n't find them to have much of a kick at all
1	Even with my strong aversion to wasting food , I had to throw out or give away most of the case
1	Kettle still advertises their products as containing No MSG while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities
1	You 'll be glad you did as they disappear fast
1	I love these chips and ordered them after I had some in Florida
1	Needless to say most of the chips were broken and I would not order them again
1	I received this chips in a gift basket and absolutely loved them
1	I searched high and low , but was unable to find them until I saw them here
1	I love them with dip , in chili , or just plain
1	Once you try them , you 'll be hooked
1	They 're light , crisp , great tasting , nice texture , AND they 're all natural AND low in fat and sodium
1	I recently bought a bag of them at a regular grocery store , and could n't belive my taste buds
1	That 's why I excited why I saw them here on Amazon , and decided to buy a case
1	They 're made with lots of whole grain and beans , and make a complete protein , so I have no qualms about feeding them to my kids as snacks
1	The only problem I have with them The bag is too small
1	They did a very good job with shipping the order quicklyNothing like Ace Hardware who took a week to ship
1	We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand , this is my favoritebr br BUT as noted by another reviewer   these contain MSG in the form of Yeast Extractbr br It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things , as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersomebr br Also , the bag is not very large , but half of it is air
1	I bought thi9s for my dad for a surprise birthday present because he could not find them any where else
1	So surprised to find the Taiwanshaped pineapple cakes , they are so cutebr I 've never found any pineapple cake like this at our local Asian supermarkets , so I ordered some from here
1	My friends and I think it is a good idea to order them again for our MidAutumn Festival party
1	You can even taste the fibers from pineapplebr br I opted for the traditional pineapple this time
1	I will be interested in trying out the Longan or mango variety next time
1	I purchased this 24 pack of Big Ass soda and only got 23
1	I highly recommend along with other soda , Voltagesbr br Malcom
1	Well being the big red fan that I am , I bought some of this
1	First of all let me tell you the price is amazing , I mean where else can you get this type of deal in Saudi Arabia
1	edible , not real enjoyable for the price I paid , One of the best pretzel 's I had whenbr i purchased them from Publix
1	They stopped carrying them , I must find another addiction
1	It 's moist and tender and a great little sweet treat when you want something that is n't terribly bad for your diet
1	Unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously , I neglected to not look for the word supreme in this offer and since I was then receiving free shipping had 4 delivered
1	We that is my husband , guests and meknew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed
1	BUT , currently Amazon featured the supreme babka and now I am awaiting to receive these
1	I opened the can and immediately became concerned when I saw what looked like dried white crust , rather than fluffy frosting
1	The best I can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in Better of Dead no raisins in it though
1	When lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knifebr I opted for making my own frosting instead   very easy
1	A little Sprectrum palm shortening , a lot of powdered sugar , a tiny splash of vanilla , a tiny bit of salt , and rice milk as needed for consistency , beat for 5 minutes , and I had the fluffy ' butter ' cream frosting I thought I 'd get from Cherrybrookbr br I wonder if our can was overheated in the store whole foods or somethingbr I 've read positive reviews of their frosting mix , so maybe I 'll try that next time
1	I 'm so mad at myself for wasting my money , and not trying to make it from scratch at home
1	I love Cherrybrook Kitchen and have tried almost all of their products
1	I was excited to try the Ready to Spread frosting , as I do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting
1	Save yourself the time and   I paid 499 and make your own frosting or go with another brand
1	I am glad I found this on the reduced rack for 99c
1	The taste was not bad but no way I could frost my cake
1	I too thought I had gotten a bad batchMy GDs birthday cake looks like crap
1	I recently purchased this on sale at my local grocery store now I know why it was on salebr br This is not a fluffy , creamy white frosting you 'd expect to find when opening the jar
1	Now , I was n't expecting it to be just like Betty Crocker , but it was pretty bad
1	I can honestly say this is the worst frosting we have ever bought
1	And since we were in a time crunch , we did n't have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting , so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it
1	By the time we were done decorating , we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family
1	I work in college Financial Aid and keep a bowl of these on my desk for the students
1	I used to buy them in the grocery store then learned I could get them for less online 17 for 3 lb bag and thought that was a good deal   until I found this GREAT deal
1	The sausage I used in dirty rice , the hamburger I used for taco salad , the chicken with wild rice , and the pork with stuffing
1	the turkey I gave to a neighbor because I do n't eat it
1	There is a mild spamlike texture and taste to the meatsbut way better than spam any day , almost a brine or something , that 's why I heavily seasoned it

1	My personal use is to add this to kombucha , maximizing it 's longevity that way , I 've tried many but this one is the best for kombucha
1	They say an 8 oz glass has 2 servings of fruit on the Lakewood website
1	Considering the price of Goji berries I really like their inclusion in this drink , albeit at a lesser levelbr br BTW Amazon had only 1 day wait before shipping
1	For that exotic unique acai experience try Zola or Samzon brandsbr br I 'm not saying that this Lakewood juice product is n't nutritious
1	To add that wonderful rich smooth cheese flavor that accompanies mac and cheese , you will have to add your own organic cheesebr br The cheese packet falls flat on flavor and it does not contain a sufficient amount to coat the pasta
1	If this flavor lasted longer than it does , I 'd probably die of starvation for lack of wanting to take it out of my mouth
1	My husband and I were very disappointed in this coffee , very weak , watery cup of coffee
1	For me , the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman 's full middle flavor is a plus
1	I prefere Kikoman , especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct
1	But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor
1	I have n't tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor , which is how soy sauce is usually usedbr   Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce
1	If you want a unique Kentucky gift for an Asian friend , this is different than the standard bottle of Bourbon or box of chocolate
1	I watched an episode o How Things are Made on Discovery Channell and saw Bluegrass Soy Sauce featured
1	My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised and liked it very much
1	In the past , I made many trips to the Far East and developed a real liking for Soy Sauce where virtually all of it is made
1	My bottle arrived just in time for a sushi dinner and game night planned with friends
1	I 'm going back to order more right now , and I 'll be ordering 3 extra bottles because they are going to make a great little gift that 's affordable and unique instead of the traditional bottle of wine that so common it 's boring
1	If you enjoy the flavor of soy you will really like thisbr br Plus its hand made in the good ole USA
1	Thanks to Amazon , we were able to find it again
1	Saw this on How it is made , which was a very interesting processbr Decided to give it a try , I really enjoy the flavor it addsbr Looking forward to trying it on several more dishesbr Thanks to those who brewed it
1	most soy sauce is from Japan but they are having problems with radiation in their soy bean fields
1	yea You pay more but decided not to take a chance on Japan
1	I 'm pleased with these was n't sure how they 'd be able to replicate the autumn classic flavors of caramel apples , but figured Werther 's was a good bet
1	I 'm diabetic , so wolfing down a real caramel apple when the mood strikes just ca n't happen as often as I 'd like to do so
1	But these are tasty enough to get me through until I can ' carb budget ' the real thing
1	These are made with sugar alcohols , so it 's wise to limit how many are eaten in a day unless you 're going to be near home and have turboflush on your toilet
1	This item , WERTHER 'S SUGAR FREE HARD CANDY , if consumed , will give you   or your friends , loose bowels
1	I purchased 12 bags and discovered more than a bowel problem You ca n't return them
1	I have ten unopened bags you can have   for free
1	I usually brew   drink Organic Sumatra Mandeling from BJ 's
1	I use this blend exclusively , so to get a cup that rivals the complex flavor from my Tassimo brewer is fantastic
1	We 've tried many Tassimo flavors
1	Our normal cup of coffee is Starbuck 's house blend out of a Cuisinart pot but one or two days a week we use our Tassimo
1	I do n't understand the current price over 20 for 14 disks and hope that it will be lowered on Amazon
1	I also adore Amazon , but they need to negotiate a better price for their Tassimo Disks
1	and I always get 20 off which brings it down to 800   they were 750 before the 20 off readily available coupons until about 3 months ago
1	Again , this is an excellent blend with full flavor   not bitter   I think it 's my favorite
1	I have tried about 75 of the available TDiscs , and the Kona Blend is one of the best regularunflavored coffees for Tassimo
1	I will buy it again because it 's a nice , mellow blend , and my favorite daily coffee , Nabob , must now be shipped from Canada
1	However , on my first order to the Canadian company , it 's taking a long time to be delivered still have n't gotten itbr br The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this Kona coffee is actually only 15 Kona
1	If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc , you can see that information , and there 's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description
1	So it 's my fault for not reading more carefully , but I was happy to see what I thought was 100 Kona and was n't careful
1	I 've bought the 15 Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs , but I just read the product title and orderedbr br As I said , the coffee tastes good , the amount of coffee is the usual amount , neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size , and I would recommend the coffee
1	Of all the coffee 's available for Tassimo this Kona has the richest flavor and fantastic aroma bybr far my favorite
1	I think these are my favorite cookies ever
1	Too bad you can no longer find them anywhere for less than twohundred count
1	I do n't think I need THAT many
1	It is a smoother , creamier basic chocolatebr br I fully recommend the Milka Naps Mix Gift Boxbr br Anthony Trendlbr editor , HungarianBookstorecom
1	I ordered for my dad for fathers day and he ate the whole box within two daysbr He said it tasted really good , now I want to order some for myself , haha
1	It was smaller than I imagined it and I thought it was expensive for how small it was
1	However , I am in Germany and can get it easier here
1	Great product and fun for our USA family to receive
1	I eat mustard with everything , this is hands down THE BESt mustard I have ever tried , in fact everyone I tell to try some , falls in love with it as well
1	Spicy , tasty , real qualitybr If you like spicy mustard , you will love this
1	The laddoos turned bad in a few days after we received it
1	I would buy again once I need more
1	Our ferret loves this rabbit it 's a nice high protein treat in addition to his regular Evo ferret diet
1	He did n't have the patience to be precise about the water temperature and when , half an hour before it was done , it appeared not to have risen at allI feared for the worse
1	Fortunately we had lots of deli meats , since the whole loaf disappeared within the hourbr br We 've had all but the sourdough peasant bread so far I 'm sure that will be delicious as well
1	Used them for a beethemed party , and now we use them as to go packs of honey for our coffee and tea
1	I was very happy with the quick shipping as i needed it for a school product for my daughter but when it came in the roof was broken and the corner of the house was broken

1	My son is a SB fanatic so I was so excited to find this for the 2010 holiday season as every year we do some version of gingerbread
1	I knew by reading reviews that there would n't be enough yellow frosting so I whipped up so edible glue water and confectionery sugar to hold the levels of gingerbread that make the pineapple and save the yellow frosting for the outside   this worked great
1	My 5 year old did like making it though
1	I am a preschool teacher and do a G is for Gingerbread unit every January
1	I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found
1	I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week
1	So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday
1	I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme
1	I called Amazon , they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them
1	I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come broken
1	I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100 's of orders
1	I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed
1	I was pleasantly surprised to find this item had been delivered the day after my order , my speediest delivery to date
1	These cookies were fun to paint but not too tasty to eatbr The kids did not really care much , but it might have beenbr more fun if they could have eaten thembr br They really had fun coloring them
1	I was disappointed in this product because I thought it would be biggerbr Also , it did not come with enough icing
1	I had to use my own
1	I think it would be fun to make and a cute decoration , but my son is going to want to eat it
1	It invigorates like a puncture wound , and the only revival is that , after drinking , you discover that you are still alivebr br Well , one tea bag was enough for me
1	If she likes it , she can have the whole box
1	I am a huge fan of Twinings teas , and was very excited to try this new blend
1	I thought one of my ingredients must be rancid
1	I hunted around for almost four minutes before I realized it was the tea
1	i have it every morning
1	I love the aroma and the taste of the fruit and vanilla combo , and the addition of ginseng for an added energy boost rounds this tea out nicely for me
1	Their actual stores are rare , but Kroger , WalMart , Martin 's formerly Ukrops and a long list of other grocery stores and many malls stock their productsbr br I have never encountered milk chocolates with caramel filling to surpass the quality of these
1	You can eat them quickly , or take your time and savor every moment of eating every one
1	They did n't believe they deserved receiving these , but I know they did deserve to receive these
1	Do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight   you will end up an addict like mebr   The Ghiradelli product is far better than the CaramelloHershey product in every way
1	Of course , we all know how delicious Ghirardelli chocolate is
1	Unfortunately , after I purchased two of these gift bags online , I found them in a local store for half the price
1	I gave it to my girlfriend as a surprise gift and she absolutely loved it
1	the first time i ordered this it came all melted but amazon was quick to remedy the situation by sending me another of the product and it was great thank you
1	These soups are a nice fill in when you do n't want too much but do n't want to be hungry for a few hours
1	Had I known that I would not have purchased the set
1	I really was looking forward to using the cute looking mug on a daily basis
1	These small chocolate cups are a specialty party item that I have never been able to find in the past when I wanted them
1	Adds a touch of class to your event and elevates you to host supreme
1	I could not find these in any local store , so was happy to find them onlinebr Most people are unaware of them , so they are impressed when I serve them a little cordial or other liquor in a chocolate cup
1	Besides that mentioned in the title , the only other remarks I have about it is the price is hard to beat , the taste is akin to a Flintstone strawberry vitamin for those of you that have tasted them , and taste lasts for not very long
1	I love this flavor and I ca nt find it on the shelves anymore
1	If some other yahoo deems it ok to give give a suck review to this stuff because he does n't like the taste , I feel I must assert that in this as in all matters of taste De Gustibus Non Disputandem Estbr br I really love this gum
1	It has a wonderfully smooth consistency about halfway through , but then it gets tired , stuff , and squeakybr br You 'll forgive the squeaks perhaps when you find , as I did , that this stuff is a wonderful dietetic aid
1	By obsessively chewing this product I filled my gut with odorless room air and so helped me lose 25 in 3 monthsbr br Also , it does n't lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight
1	HAD NUMEROUS EAR PROBLEMS WITH OUR COCKER SPANIEL AND THEY HAVE CLEARED UP SINCE TAKING THIS FOOD
1	My father could no longer take care of his beloved 6 year old Cocker Spaniel , so I decided to take her into my family
1	When I brought her to NYC she had ear and eye discharge
1	After a check up with a vet that ruled out infection , I decided to try Royal Canin based on the numerous good reviewsWithin a week her ear and eye problems were gone and she dropped a good amount of weight
1	This is going to be the only food that we will be feeding her
1	Our Spaniel has tried several foods in her 6 years , and this is the only one she will eat by itself without any people food being added of course , we still treat her occasionally
1	When we went in for our 12 month toothcleaning appointment , the vet told us to take her home as her teeth did n't need any cleaning for another 6 months , at least
1	Royal Canin was recommended for my dog , but since this line of dog food is specific to breed , it was difficult to find in stores
1	This is food especially designed for Cocker spaniels who have a range of health issuesI have been using this product with three of my dogs and all of them are very happy with it
1	I tired many different dog foods over the 3 yrs I have my cocker spaniel
1	I then came upon this breed specific dog food   figured I 'd try it
1	My dog loves this food and always finishes his food
1	I 've used this for over 1 yr now   he has not tired of it
1	I have seen a significant change for the better in him , he 's more active and doing wellbr br I only buy this brand food for him nowbr br Buster gives it 2 paws up   I give it 5 stars
1	I bought this for my one year old Cocker
1	All their coats look better , they all shed less , eat less , use the bathroom less , my Cocker used to have this one chronic ear since the time I have had her as a puppy that it just gave her problems
1	Her eyes give her less problems
1	And my 7yr old Yorkie he eats less , he used to throw up all the time had the most sensitive tummy
1	Our black lab mix , hot spots and she would just lick her fur off
1	I do mix it roughly 5050 with Naturals dog food blend
1	They are doing greatbr br Sept 2012br I love this breed specific food , however I just went to place my next bimonthly order and I am shocked at the price hike in just over a month
1	I paidbr 4179 on Aug 3 for a 25 lb bag and here it is Sept 20Th and the price has is now 5394 , a difference of 1215 in price
1	This is a huge amount to go up considering that I am assuming this is a price gouge due to the speculation over crops   I will look to my local vet for this product
1	I can get a large bag now less at Petco as well with the discounts they offer
1	They will order a larger bag if you ask
1	fast and great service , my Cavashon Loves this low fat dog food
1	Arrived in great condition , thank you thank you thank you
1	We are Chocolate Moose   Mickey Moose , br br Our nice owner bought this great food for us
1	We love it very much , I have gained 5 lbs
1	because I eat all of Mickey 's food when he is n't looking
1	My 7 year old Cocker Spaniel loves this food and it 's good for him   he needs to lose a few pounds and this is doing the trick
1	Glad I found it on Amazon
1	My 50 lb bag of oatmeal seemed like way too much , but as time went on I found more and more uses for it
1	I have so many recipes that I make weekly that I 'm running out
1	I am using them to make a product designed to increase and enrich the milk production in lactating mothersbr The oats were shipped to me in a timely fashion and the amazing thing is I only paid 499 shipping for 50lbs of oats
1	I encourage anyone who likes oats to order Honeyville Rolled Oats
1	The US made version of this Cadbury chocolate has a distinct taste from the UK version of the chocolate which I have been eating since childhood
1	To all my friends from India   buy this chocolate if it is either made in UK or India otherwise you will be disappointed as I was
1	This version by Hershey is not what you expect from England , Australia or New Zealand Cadbury
1	It does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differentlybr br If you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non Hershey versionbr br Hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality Cadbury chocolate to USA
1	My first taste of this tea saved my trip home from Santa Cruz , when both the hotel and a restaurant had stale powder in the tea bags
1	How I needed my fix
1	A tourist stop with a giant artichoke beckoned , and this Chinese Breakfast   Yunnan Black Tea set me straightbr br Other reviewers have said it tastes odd
1	We love it and it really starts the morning off right
1	The taste is wonderful without any additions and it will remain our tea of choice in the morning and often throughout the day
1	The resealable bags work well , and unopened they protect my large stash , making it easier to manage my subscription
1	I only make it for when I am in the hurry and will not be able to fully enjoy my tea anyway
1	I 've used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious , consistently good quality black tea
1	Mainly I use it and several other Numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha
1	I grew up on Yunnan tea as a child   it was always my mother 's favorite   so I was happy to find an economical source of it of a quality that was great for a large volume habitual tea drinker like me
1	Yunnan is nice in that it will brew dark so you do not need much at a time
1	If you want something that is flowery yet more subtle than Earl Grey this Yunnan or a Keemun may be a nice option to explore
1	I have drunk it pretty much every day for the last five years and I never get tired of it
1	I like a little stevia in it , as I 'm a wimp
1	You can see by the leaves once they are soaked that it is a premium tea
1	I read the other reviews before purchasing am pleased that I did
1	I have purchased other Numi teas and gave generally been happy with all of theri products
1	Having eaten and reeaten my way though all of the DAS caramel range , this remains my alltime favorite , and the one that usually gets the most rave reviews when I share them which is n't an easy thing to do   just try one and you 'll see what I mean
1	I 've been a caramel fan for ages , and while Werthers Butterscotch will do in a pinch , nothing has come closer to what my mother used to make than these
1	They are chewy , buttery , and the little crunches of salt are spectacular OK my mother did n't put salt in hers , this is an improvement
1	Although I did enjoy the other flavor I ordered a tiny bit more , the Chocolate with walnuts one , this was still a very enjoyable flavor
1	I 'd order this or the Chocolate and walnut flavor again for sure , along with more of Das Food 's gourmet salt
1	I will certainly buy them again
1	I missed the mix of rich , buttery , dairy flavor with caramelized sugar that I expect in caramels
1	being an old chemist with a spectrophotometer I am pleased when the chemical is what they say it is this is what they advertized
1	I use it to make my body more alkaline , so it 's great for changing your pH level in your body
1	I recently started using Bob 's Red Mill Baking Soda
1	I 'm very pleased with it 's performance and I can be sure that it is not contaminated with aluminum
1	If you are concerned with an aluminum free product , then this is the product for you
1	Save your hard earned money and buy Bob 's Red Mill regular baking soda
1	Arm   Hammer is great for general cleaning purposes , but for natural beauty and health care , this brand is perfectbr br Just thought you 'd all like to know
1	I almost fell for it myself until I did a little digging around
1	br br PS So as not to let all of amazoncomland feel I am one of those haters who do n't really know what they 're talking about , I LOVE Bob 's Red Mill Co and shall continue purchasing their excellent products
1	However , I will continue to buy this product regardless as it is quality oatmeal at a good pricebr br Edit I 'm on my 4th bag , quality continues to be high
1	I will admit , as a single person I bought these oats with my boyfriend for breakfast food it lasted us for the yearbr br Otherwise it 's an excellent buy
1	I ca n't eat these oats , they have a funny taste to them
1	My kids also think they taste funny
1	My husband thinks they are OK , so he has 50 pounds of oats to eat on his own
1	Of the many purchses I made on Amazon this past December , I was most pleased with the Pocky Chocolate Cream Covered Biscuit Sticks Pack of 10
1	They arrived on time , and they were a ' hit ' as a surprised gift
1	Got these for my kids as Christmas stocking stuffers
1	They love them
1	I 'm not sure how you review something that 's as subjective as taste , but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker , you 'll like this it does n't taste exactly like either of those , but that 's the closest analogy for me
1	The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind , dipped in chocolate , with one end left just normal cracker to you do n't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eatingbr br Here 's some of the nitty gritty details   each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets , that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks
1	The packets themselves are really cleverly designed , with a little slit cut in the folded part , you just grab both sides and pull , and it opens up the package without any hassle   got ta love Japanese product design
1	It does contain milk , wheat , soybeans and sheanut   so if any of these are an issue for you , then you 'll want to pass
1	It also says on the packaging that the facility they 're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts   the product does n't use either of them , but the disclosure is nice if you 're particularly sensitive to eitherbr br Overall a great snack at a great price   the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets , so that 's quite a few snacks
1	One note , if you live in a hot climate , do n't order them in the summer because they will melt together in shipping
1	The product and the concept is good but you will be better off buying it from a supermarket or directly get it from someone visiting Japan
1	First of all , I love the packaging making it heatproof but it would n't have been a problem because I ordered it it winter and they were freakishly cold
1	I also want to thank VeryAsia for the free sample of mi gorengit was delicious
1	I bought these back in January and never got around to reviewing them
1	I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out
1	I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me maybe it had to be imported but when it did , it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever
1	I 'm definitely considering restocking on this in the future if I ca n't find a local storebr br EDIT Oct 11 , 2012br br Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchasebr br So I decided to restock after I could n't fight the craving anymore
1	What I received was not the picture shown on the front page 2 per pack japanese pocky , it was a 1 per pack pockyish thing from Thailand
1	Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door
1	The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth , this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouthbr br Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor
1	I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a not eat everything at once and b avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items
1	I can honestly say that I wo n't be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much
1	I wo n't change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3
1	If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received
1	That includes our 3 year old
1	I discovered these snacks at an anime convention though I 'd heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them
1	They are very , very slim sticks of biscuity stuff the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels that have a charming tiny popping crispness
1	The chocolate flavor , a nice nonbitter , nondark , generically pleasing chocotaste , seems to be the most popular given how fast they sell out at cons , but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream
1	We all know it 's supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet
1	Unless you 're really prone to bingeeating or ca n't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number
1	10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat , 3 of them saturated
1	In fact , just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effectbr br If you love the flavor of coconutchocolate together like Almond Joy try the coconut chocolate ones
1	Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout ' caramel delights cookies which are , in turn , similar to the old Yes Yes cookies from the seventies or sobr br Anyway , if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those sticklooking treats , or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats , this is what they were eating
1	  Fun treatsbr br However , with this crazy hot summer , I 'd recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall 's cooler weather
1	You might get a sticky , clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather
1	In South Florida , Tate 's Comics has them in a variety of flavorsand FRESH and NOT MELTED
1	Pocky is an incredibly good snack , but more than that , I was impressed with Very Asia 's packaging
1	I had stupidly ordered something as easy to melt as chocolate in the dead heat of summer
1	TT So of course I was expecting all the pocky in my 10 boxes to be melted away , but they took the special care to put the pocky in a box reading PROTECT FROM HEAT and my pocky arriving in perfect condition
1	I love Very Asia more than anything now
1	I think the Pocky did not get stored rightly
1	Many of them stick together , and whenever I want to split them up , it just becomes very messy
1	Now I need to clean up my desk every time after I have it
1	Everyone loves Pocky and if they say they do n't they are lying lol
1	These where great could nt stop eating thembr Lowest priced anywhere and will buy even more next timebr Ca nt say enough about these , they where shipped faster than what I paid to have shipped alsobr Thank you so much
1	I had bought Pocky when on vacation and enjoyed it but living where there are no Asian stores I have to shop on the internet
1	Then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about 60 the length of a normal snack bar
1	If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25 of the space inside the boxbr br As far as taste goes they are soso
1	Celiacs , who are used to inferior products , wo n't be disappointed in the taste of this onebr br I 've also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging
1	But when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarterbr br I really want to like this company
1	I bought their granola many times , always wanting to like it , but it is some of the worst food I 've ever had
1	The clusters are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for gerbils than peoplebr br All in all I would not recommend Enjoy Life foods
1	This was the first peanut free product I bought for my son
1	I thought they were tasty
1	For some reason they think they are strawberry bars
1	Amazon has a wonderful price and I just wish it could be a subscribe item
1	I have recently stopped eating a number of allergens dairy , soy , nuts and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions
1	I threw them away
1	I would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free
1	My daughter had extensive food allergies as an infanttoddler and we bought these bars consistently
1	She still has the nut and egg allergy so I like that I can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe
1	Unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars all varieties they have been hard as a rock and my daughter wo n't eat them
1	I have tried them myself and thought I might break a tooth
1	I had them on subscribe and save which I have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat
1	I want to love these bars and I love everything the company stands for and actually really like their cookies , but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing
1	I hope they address the issue and I will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture
1	I find that they have a good berry taste
1	i love them
1	HOWEVER I DONT APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT I OPENED MY NEW BOX AND THE CUT 14 OF IT OFF
1	I AM NOT A TODDLER I NEED A REAL SIZE BAR PLEASE
1	I was extremely disappionted when I opened my shipment of Enjoy Life On The Go Bars Very Berry , Carmel Apple , and Cocoa Loco
1	I then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes I still had at home
1	Next , I tastetested , and let my 3 year old help
1	He would n't eat the new onesand I ca n't blame him
1	My 10 year old son ate one and did n't like them
1	I ate one and agreed as did my husband
1	We do n't have any negative reactions to the ingredients and though we do n't buy many pre packaged foods , these work for ' onthego '
1	Our family tried several varieties and I prefer the Cocoa Loco Bars they 're almost like a Tootsie Roll to methough I ca n't eat Tootsie Rolls , so this is a great substitute for that occasional craving
1	My family prefers the Very Berry Bars because they can eat those when they miss breakfast , need a healthy snack , or my son will take them on his cross country running meets
1	They are very dense and fillingnot a ' soft bar ' and we always eat them while having some liquid to drink at the same time
1	My 6mo son was diagnosed with some severe FA and since he 's still breastfed , I had to drastically alter my dietbr br Before learning about this brand , I was stuck eating chicken breasts with potatoes for every meal
1	So when I stumbled upon this at my local Whole Foods , I was very excited to try itbr br Overall , I really like them
1	It 's not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box which really is n't that bigbr br I know alot of people complain about the sizepackaging and I agree somewhat
1	I like the Berry flavor the best , it 's the closest to real , non FA specialty flavor
1	Overally , I 'm grateful for these bars because now I can tote several in my diaper bag and car and know that when I really need a quick snack , I wo n't be left stranded
1	This is an item he loves and is a convenience for me
1	I feel good giving them to him and they taste great
1	If you are looking for a great gluten free snack you wo n't be sorry you chose this product
1	Yeah , we 're gluten free , so our food is a lot more dense than other food , but honestly , can we not have normal sized , good tasting granola bars
1	They are OK , but my husband only eats them when we are in car
1	We keep them there for a celiac snack
1	He wo n't eat them otherwise
1	They are definitely raspberry , but are kind of drybr   We have never tried any other snack bars , so in all honesty they may be the norm
1	I do n't knowbr   We DO like Enjoy Life 's other productsbr   They are GF , have no MSG or related products or aspartates
1	They are a little smaller and you may still be hungry if it is for a meal
1	I give one to my 5 year old son for breakfast and he is still a little hungry for more
1	Either that or they taste so good he wants more
1	Recently diagnosed a glutenintolerant , I have been looking for products that allow me to resume a semblance of my former life
1	My son Loves these fruit bars they are smaller than your typical wheat fruit bars
1	My suggestion it to get your child to like these first before you try the chocolate ones Now my son favors them chocolate ones MORE than the berry ones
1	If you want a really good snack bar try these , they are healthy and taste as good as any granola bar , but without the gluten
1	Then scoop it up and put it in your mouthbr br That 's how disgusting this bar isbr br I have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful , IT HAS NONE
1	I 've done nutritional coaching for 30 years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellentbr br This neanderthalera gluten free bar is so bad I want to go to my local grocery store , take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store perhaps , if there 's a trash compactor
1	just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this productbr br Save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything elsebr br Enjoy Life bars
1	My brother bought me a pound of this coffee for Christmas
1	He told me that weaver was the original roaster for Pete 's coffee , he eventually split off and started his own roaster
1	Well let me tell you the stuff is delicious
1	I 've never been married to a brand of coffee , usually would buy the Starbucks 25 lb bag at Costco , or whatever looked good at Trader Joes , but Weavers is in a class of it 's own
1	I 'm subscribing to guarantee I can have this stuff delivered to me regularly
1	I must say you wo nt be displeased with your purchase , this is a must buy
1	I run The American Pavilion in Cannes and Weaver 's was by far and away our most popular coffee sponsor
1	We did a booming business this year
1	You 'll be so happy you did
1	Better packaging might solve thisbr br If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells , or are entertaining and want a conversation piece , then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list
1	My husband , son and I often share this wonderful tea after dinner
1	However , I do have issues with the product , namely , me and my family members ca n't take the smell
1	The taste is horrible so I put it in a lotion cream and rubbed it on my skin
1	This was a few weeks ago and though I 've since changed my sheets , the scent is still in my bed
1	Ultimately , I stopped using it because it made me smell in a way I did not like
1	We introduced it when they were 7 months old and now they 're 10 months
1	I 'm glad they are eating something green because we could n't get them to eat the one with peas when we tried at 7 months , but we got them to eat the peas later at 9 monthsbr br Their favorite vegetable is sweet potato and we 've also tried sweet potato with cinnamon
1	They love all the fruit varietiesbr br I 'm glad they love this one because lentils and brown rice form a complete protein , although a view of the ingredients shows that lentils is not one of the prime ingredientsbr br This one also has carrots and I 've heard all babies like carrots
1	I do n't know if they would like it without the carrots
1	I have n't seen this one   lentils and brown rice   in our local stores , so I 'm glad to get it here
1	I 've ordered an unbelievable number of cases of jars of different types and only had one jar arrive brokenbr br Ingredients per label Water , organic apples , organic carrots , organic brown rice , organic lentils , organic canola oilbr br This has 70 calories , 10 protein , 100 vitamin A , 4 vitamin C , 2 calcium and 4 ironbr br I 'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult
1	My twin 10month old babies treat this one as dessert
1	Their first Earth 's Best jar they loved was straight sweet potatoes
1	I recommend this flavor brandbr br Ingredients per label Water , organic sweet potatoes , organic apricot puree , mechanically separated organic chicken , organic brown rice flourbr br The rice flour absorbed the water and gave it a real nice consistency , and the sweet potatoes gave it a nice colorbr br Nutrition per label 80 calories , 15 protein , 90 vitamin A , 2 vitamin C , 2 calcium and 6 ironbr br This one had the most vitamin A of all Earth 's Best jars I 've tried
1	I 've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult
1	I liked getting this one for my twin 10month olds because it has such interesting ingredients , particularly the zucchini and the garbanzo beans
1	I like the fact that it 's vegetarian yet I believe it has a complete protein since it also has brown rice
1	They have liked everything that has carrotsbr br I have the subscription for this one as I really like the ingredients and the fact that I 'm giving the babies food that is naturally greenbr br Ingredients per the label Water , organic corn , organic zucchini , organic green beans , organic brown rice , organic carrots , organic garbanzo beans , organic canola oilbr br This has 70 calories , 8 protein , 40 vitamin A , 10 vitamin C , 2 calcium and 2 iron
1	I 've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult
1	Baby loved this one , but as he has progressed I had to cut this one out because it is too runny and if I have to move the spoon quickly out of the way of his grabby hands , it is all over
1	I think they could use a little less water maybe a little more potato to make it more the consistency of the turkey dinner one
1	You can add cranberries if you want to take it to the next level
1	I just ca n't find nonsweetened and nondried cranberries even at the better food storesbr br Apples , carrots and turkey taste good to my 10month old growing twin girls
1	The whole barley flour absorbs the water to give it an acceptable consistencybr br The ingredients per the label Water , organic apples , organic carrots , mechanically separated organic turkey , organic whole barley flourbr br In addition to 12 protein and 50 vitamin A , it has 6 calcium and 4 ironbr br I 'm very pleased my babies like this food and are being introduced to so many foods through Earth 's Best
1	I 've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult
1	I wish it came in larger portions since my 10 month old always wants 2 jars
1	For me I love that i can get lentils , there are n't many stage 2 or 3 vegetarian choices
1	The other posters say they notified Earth 's Best about this in August and they are still selling it without checking or recalling
1	No more earth 's best for my little guy
1	I am taking my business elsewhere and I am very sad that organic company is selling baby food with plastic and bpa in their jars
1	They got ta do better than this to get my business
1	I like the Earth 's Best baby food line because of the organic ingredients
1	Amazon has great prices especially if you subscribe and free delivery to your doorstop , which is convenient when you 're a busy mom
1	As other reviewers have stated , it 's a bit runnier that other EB 's stage 2 foods , so I add some oatmeal to it
1	She had problems with constipation for about 25 months , sometimes going up to 10 days before we had to give her a suppository , and then I discovered that this food makes her poop every time I also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber
1	I think I purchased 50 jars so far
1	I do n't know how everyone else got these broken , but when I received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap , not a single jar was broken
1	My son loves them and the price was great and I had no issues at all
1	I would love to say that I have the time to make my son 's food everyday
1	Honestly , I do make it most of the time , but some days , you just do n't have the timeenergy to get it all done
1	Before I bought this baby food , I read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it , its like a dessert , yadda yadda yadda
1	We love earth 's best organic baby food , but this is not the tastiest one
1	Soft smooth texture   my little one devours this oneit is one of the best meatveg dinners we have found
1	I can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what I wanted to mix in there it was horribly runny , like spooning formula into his mouth
1	My daughter was not a big fan of baby food , especially any with proteins , but she did LOVE this one
1	My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor , so it 's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you do n't know a particular baby 's preferencesbr Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth 's Best , especially for having chicken
1	I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture , and she liked that just fine , but it is an extra step
1	I have twin girls , they both loved the Vegetable Turkey Dinner
1	I normally love Earth 's Best products as does my son
1	However , tonight after I 'd given him half the jar I thought I would try some since it was a new flavor and I realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it
1	As this is my first child and I do n't have any experience with this kind of thing , I called poison control
1	They said he would be ok and once I knew he was fine , I got really angry
1	I looked it up online and found that Earth 's Best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it
1	My son really enjoys Earth 's Best lentil
1	I introduced my daughter to Earth 's Best Organic Turkey Vegetable Dinner at 4 months
1	A bit early , but she 's advanced , as she was 6 weeks overdue
1	But , I bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite
1	Of all of them , this is also my least favorite
1	We received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today
1	I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature I put them in a bowl and microwave for 69 seconds and taste ok
1	When I tasted this , I made a face because it was so yucky
1	To her credit , my 8 month old daughter ate some bites , but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors
1	I 'm not a fan myself , but I 'm not the one eating it
1	Any time I can get a variety of vegetables into my baby in one sitting , I 'm a happy mom
1	The Rice and Lentil dinner is our son 's absolute favorite
1	I do n't know why but he gobbles this up every time
1	He enjoys most of the Earth 's Best foods and we have only found a couple he does n't eat anything with too much apple which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination
1	My 712 month old absolutely loves this oneby far , it is her favorite jarred baby food
1	I like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food , and I 'm not ready to introduce her to meats yetbr br I do subscribe   save , which brings the price down to 080jar
1	The bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find   I have to go to Whole Foods
1	My regular grocery store and Target carry Earth 's Best , but not this blend
1	My daughter likes it so much , though , that I would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices
1	I always try the food before I feed it to my daughter and this one is actually pretty good
1	She gets all excited when I make it for her
1	From 6 month to 12 month , my son barely ate any solid food
1	We tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that he 'd actually finish the whole jar
1	I did n't expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it , but I guessed it wrongbr Now he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater
1	His current favorite seems to be tofu , but he still loves corn , zucchini , brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this
1	I highly recommend to try this baby foodbr br Also , Earth 's Best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well
1	My son does n't really like any snacks from Gerber brand , but he likes most of the products from Earth 's Best
1	Reviewing baby food is objective since all children are different , so I hope letting you know the consistency and texture help
1	This tastes so good that apparently our cat thinks so too   he 's constantly poking his furry face around every time we pop open one of these
1	I know some people have complained about the poor packaging but I believe that must 've been fixed bc I 've not had any problems at all   in fact , they securely bubble wrap these , then place them in an aircushioned box and it all arrives perfectly every time
1	I have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review , but they like all the flavors , the textures are great , and the jars open easily
1	My son started eating this when he was around 8 months old he 's now 14 months old and it 's one of his favorites
1	Unfortunately , they do n't carry it at the local grocery store they carry other varieties of Earth 's Best just not this one or his other favorites , SpinachPotatoes and Spaghetti with Cheese they do carry it at some of the Whole Foods so I buy them there
1	I 'm so glad to find them on Amazon
1	I get TIRED of ringing up a gazillion little jars at the storebr br We use this as a base and mix in other things   bits of cooked broccoli , small pieces of meat
1	I 've also started adding spices to introduce him to new flavors
1	My baby loves Rice and Lentil and is one of her favorite things to eat
1	If we are going somewhere I wo n't be able to warm the food she will eat this one cold
1	We tried 3rd foods on her and she does n't like the texture of them
1	This is really good for her and she likes it , so we keep buying it
1	My son loves the Best Earth 's baby food and his favorite seems to be the Vegetable and Turkey
1	He smiles at every mouthfulbr br I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for healthy feeding the organic way
1	All the food I feed my son is through Earth 's Best
1	I usually make my baby 's food it 's so easy , steam fruits   veggies and puree but sometimes I do n't have enough time to cook and I buy Earth 's Best baby foodsbaby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but did n't like this one
1	When I tried it I understood why , I would n't eat it myself either it tastes nasty my poor baby immediately I made her a homemade potato , zucchini ,   asparagus puree and she loved it
1	My six month old baby loves the Earth 's Best 2nd Sweet Potato Chicken Dinner   it 's his favorite
1	He seems to love all the Earth 's Best 2nd foods   fruits , vegetables , and dinners
1	After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge , it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out
1	It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has , especially zucchinibr I had to update my review today , because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food
1	I notified Earth 's Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing , but I am not giving my baby this food any more , even though she likes it , that 's it for us
1	The earths best he eats the most , this one is a little thicker than his original chickensweet potato favorite which is very runny
1	I 'd continue to buy but I 'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jarsshattered too many
1	I did n't eat any but my baby liked it
1	She said it was savory but sweet and it reminded her of fine dining in Tuscany
1	Also I like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste
1	And if you do n't recycle then you and I have nothing in common and you should stop reading here
1	Nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy
1	You just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day
1	I just wanted to post here that I found small bits of plastic in this food as I was feeding my 9 month old
1	So please be careful if you buy this or are considering itbr br My daughter LOVES this food it 's actually her favorite
1	This is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over 2 months
1	I am a true Seattle coffee addict , and I have never had a better coffee candy
1	Sent this basket to my father for his birthday
1	I needed something in a pinch and it came even earlier than expectedSO THANK YOU AGAIN
1	I got it for my Girlfriend for her Birthday
1	I love dark chocolate , so I loved the dark chocolate almonds
1	Next time I 'll give the Organic version of this product to someone close so they share with me
1	As a child my facorite memory was drinking Sassafras tea made from fresh sassafras with my Granddad
1	I found that to get the taste I remember I needed 2 bags per cup
1	I grew up in Ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful
1	I ordered this online and received it in just a few days 3
1	I purchased this tea for my neighbor as a present , she has been looking for sassafras tea for a long time , I did n't realize it was so hard to find
1	I heard some great things about Sassafras and wanted to try it
1	I was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated
1	for about 2 years he would complain to be about how he has n't had this tea since he was about 9 finally , after many nights of drinking my tea annoyed , i bought him the tea so he 'd shut up
1	After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea
1	I looked online and found it at Amazoncom
1	As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags
1	I thought I 'd order a box to try
1	It also did n't have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras rootbr br I 've never had real Sassafras tea made with the root so I do n't know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not
1	I did not care for this product at all , I thought it was the same tea my sisters and I use to drink when we were in elementary school
1	I found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree
1	I purchased this because I read that it was a natural cure for hivesUm , how about NOT
1	Luckily , a coworker of mine loves this stuff reminds him of his grandmother and I gave it to him
1	For example , if you order these in April and the batch you receive has a June use by date , it may be a stretch to consume the 300 bags before the seeds start going rancid on you
1	Since they 're roasted in oil and unsalted , these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety , even if refrigerated upon receiptbr br Amazon does n't seem to specify use by dates for the food products they sell , so it 's a gamble for the purchaser
1	I 'm assuming that Amazon wo n't ship stuff that has expired , but they probably ship out the oldest stock first , and the use by date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice
1	I love Panang Curry but would rather avoid the white rice that most restaurants serve with it
1	So decided to try making my own , and with this product , I get exactly what I want , hot tasty Panang Curry adding lots of fresh veggies , tofu and brown rice
1	I purchased this for a friend who loves to cook only to find out that I paid 3 times more than what I should be
1	1395 for 4 cans is highway robbery now that I know that I can purchase one can for around 109
1	A horrible horrible mistakean expensive mistakethey advertised it as peanut butter cookies which is why I bought them since everyone else had peanut butter chocolate cookies when I just wanted plan peanut butter cookieshowever when I received them I found out they were the chocolate peanut butter ones but I thought okay I 'll try them and omg I almost threw up from the taste
1	If they had a zero before the stars I would rate it a zero instead of 1 star
1	I 'm not from the south , but live in SoFla where sometimes we get a southern influence
1	The gravy mix I am reviewing , PIONEER COUNTRY GRAVY is DELICIOUS
1	I 've tried others Publix brand , Mc Cormick , ect , but this is the BEST
1	I chose to mix 12 water 12 milk ,   2 cooked , chopped sausage links , and it was phenomenal on my
1	I heard you can put it on potatoesveggies and chicken , make soups and add for seasoning
1	I have used Pioneer Gravy for a number of years
1	Its great to be able to get sugar this wayIts not good to eat but if you are going to use sugar at least this is not processed to an unhealthy state on top of what sugar does to your body , and i am helping the fair trade farmersIt is a good thing all aroundI am happy i can get it in Amazon
1	I am a coffee fanatic but have always stayed away from these because I never liked instant coffee and my assumption was that this would be similar
1	I really enjoy the Starbucks VIA instant coffee   but I drink so much , it is rather expensive so I thought I would give this a try
1	Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the taste
1	I bought my first 38 pack at my local grocery store for about 7
1	That seemed a little high but I figured I would check online to find the best price
1	As I started calculating all of the online prices , they are charging about 7 bucks for the 19 count
1	I would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper
1	I do n't think these coffee bags are as good as fresh ground fresh brewed coffee , but they taste far better than instant coffee
1	I highly recommend it to any coffee lover when you have access to very hot water but do n't have access to a coffee maker
1	Individual wrapped and sealed bags allow you to take one tiny tea like bag with you in your pocket or purse to your early morning meetings
1	I keep Regular bags and Decaf bags in my home at all timesbr Never have to drink old coffee
1	Especially when I need to stay up late to study or to wake up after 2 hours of sleep
1	My primary point with this review is to note that this packaging is less expensive than the other size offered by Folger
1	You get more coffee for less moneybr br   I recently started drinking coffee again after a lapse of many years
1	Since I did n't know how many cups a day I would use , I wanted to avoid the fuss of a coffeemaker
1	I was delighted to find these Folger 's bagsbr br   They brew a very nice tasting cup of coffee
1	I 'm not any kind of coffee expert , so I do n't know what special terms might be used
1	All I know is that if I let the bag seep for a bit more than a minute , it sure tastes good
1	Thanks to my very much better half , I 've also learned that each of these bags will produce at least two good cups of coffeebr br   Very convenient , very easy , very tasty
1	I intend to take some of these with me when I travel as an alternative to the inroom coffee makers or yeck
1	We ca n't have any kind of coffee maker at work , so we 're forced to buy at the inhouse coffee shop or Starbuck 's across the street
1	These are great for at work , just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee
1	I gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit
1	And I 'm glad I did
1	This tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green matcha tea I 've had , and I look forward to experiencing any of the purported health benefits of rooibos that I 've read about
1	I tried this before having normal red tea so I waited to review
1	I decided to give Pure Matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive
1	The quality of Pure Matcha 's products surpasses that of all others I have tried stays fresh , has a consistent texture and tastes great
1	I highly recommend Pure Matcha and will continue to purchase
1	This is the very best marinade you can buy as far as I am concernedof course , everyone to his or her own tastes , but all in all , I think anyone will like itI give it five stars
1	It does n't compromise of taste either , I use it as a Soy Sauce substitute and have found it to have superior taste and it looks and acts just like any good marinade should
1	If you are Celiac or Gluten intolerant , or even just watching you salt intake , this product is a way to have your steak and marinade it too
1	My poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try andbr our family really enjoyed it
1	You can smell the flavors immediately when you open the bottle
1	I put this on everything and tend to go through one bottle a week
1	I was never much of a hot sauce fan until I tasted Black Market Hot Sauce
1	I was listning to the radio one morning and the createrowner was giving an interview , It sounded interesting
1	Happy to see I can buy it online at Amazon
1	I have loved going out to some of my favorite resturants in town and seeing that they are offering this great productI really enjoy putting on my my breakfast burritos
1	They have this in a local diner that I eat in regularly
1	I use it on all kinds of foods and I love it
1	I was surprised to find it on Amazon just stumbled across it
1	I was browsing around on Amazon looking for gifts and was very pleased to see my favorite sauce on here
1	I will just order and have shipped to my friends
1	Habanero is my favorite , I love the heat and the tangy spiciness
1	I buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have
1	So far I have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing
1	My fiance and I use them nearly daily and I just picked up 3 more
1	BLACK MARKET HOT SAUCE IS WONDERFUL My husband Loves this Habenero sauce , its very very flavorful with a nice kick to it
1	We used it for everything and you can use it with any mealbr br I like the fact that there are so many different levels of spicyness
1	We love the medium   habenero
1	Thank you for your hard work guys
1	the owner is a cool dude , He 's dropped off free bottles to me in my mailbox
1	i stole the first bottle out of a friends fridge after i tasted and been hooked since
1	The one who has been soo verbally abusive and out of control with his anger that it pushed my wife away
1	if you read my earleir post , you d understand
1	The fear I had turned to anger , and that my friends left me with emptyness , no friends , no family , no wife , no kids , nothing
1	All it did was give me new fearsnow i sit alone , in a dark place , looking at myself in the mirror and realizing , noone is behind me
1	I ca nt blame her
1	If i could leave me too , i would
1	I m the one , the one you should run from
1	  I am receiving helpbut its to late for my marriage
1	All i can do is better myself for my daughter , and myself , and hope oneday , everyone will forgive me
1	I saw this article , and having had my children abused molested etc and the courts do nothing because as one police officer put it
1	Divorced from reality By MINDELLE JACOBS   I inadvertently stoked the eversimmering gender war last week when comments I reported from a domestic violence conference unleashed a fusillade of male outrage
1	From California to Massachusetts , American men flayed me for painting a picture of male abuse while ignoring the flip side   that women are also perpetrators
1	Well , as I emailed back to many of my readers , do n't shoot the messenger , guys
1	I did n't endorse the remarks of the head of the US National Coalition Against Domestic Violence , who told a women 's shelter conference that some leaders of fathers ' rights groups are abusers who wield their positions like an ideological hammer against women
1	I received countless emails from wounded men both physically and emotionally who said they 'd either been assaulted by unhinged wives or falsely accused of either harming their wives or molesting their kids
1	I 'm a guppy in a sea of really big and angry fish , wrote one man who said he was falsely accused of sexually abusing his twoyearold daughter
1	They complained about the nasty games women play to cut them out of their kids ' lives
1	He quit practising law in March after only four years as a lawyer because he 's sick of dealing with what he describes as a dysfunctional family law system
1	I could n't hack it anymore , says the 50yearold who 's writing a book called Deadbeat Judges
1	They make such harsh orders against fathers and give fathers no rights , he says
1	Several of his former clients have signed waivers allowing Brown to write about their cases
1	He 's had female clients who were unfairly treated by the courts but he says it 's mostly men who get shafted
1	He recalls appearing before the same judge four times in two months because of a woman who was n't giving her ex access to the children
1	The judge warned her there would be consequences for breaching a court order   but he never followed through
1	The more you can cut lawyers out of it , I think the better off the system would be
1	If a woman 's ever tossed in jail for the weekend for refusing her ex courtordered access to the kids , let me know
1	My wife ask for me to give her some space
1	She is going thru a stage where she wants to hang out with her girl friends drinking and just having a good time
1	I work out of town and come home every other weekend
1	Also know that she just had a hysterectomy 3 months ago
1	Before the surgery we had what I thought was a very good marriage
1	I found out that one of her girlfriends is going around saying that they have the girl my wife used to be before we became a couple
1	I know she is not seeing someone else at this time but my fear is that by giving here the space she asked for and working out of town will lead her to finding someone else
1	She told me that where she is right know she would want a divorce
1	Should I be patient and trust her or move on
1	My 16 year old daughter has been diagnosed with depression and the inability to handle changecan't remember the actual wording
1	She was living with her father and his girlfriend father is 47 and girlfriend is 27 and their new baby who is 8 months
1	She is skipping school , however is very intelligent , easily could pass even though she has missed 158 classes since start of second semester in Feb 2011
1	She is on an antidepressant , has a weekly meeting with her counsellor , is under the care of a psychiatrist , however that is very sparodic due to the health care system
1	She left her father 's house and is currently living in a girls shelter , but she now suspects that she is pregnant , is due in court next week for shoplifting and I her mother live 5 hours away
1	She has a sister that graduated from university and is working in another province , but her brother who struggles with the same issues he is 22 works for his father and lives on his own , but has a drug problem
1	The only thing that my daughter has n't done is drugs,,,,she will drink , she smokes and she skips
1	The father , my ex , has little time as he has to be the sole responsible person for the baby , work and ensure that the mother attends her meetings and testing
1	They also were doing family councelling , but this seems to have little effect on either my daughter or the girlfriend
1	I work full time , look after my mother 88 and my elderly sister 69 lives with me , along with my boyfriend 52 and his son,27
1	She has a room here , but due to her inability to adapt well to change , moving her here is very difficult as she does n't want to attend school as she knows no one
1	I love her to pieces but am at a loss as to what to do next
1	She is very good at manipulating any situation and pretty much lies about everything to her father,,,,almost tells me too much information , but at least the lines of communication are there
1	I have a son who will be 3 in March
1	I am engaged for his father
1	We had been trying to a few months to get pregnant
1	May 2009 we found out we were expecting
1	I found out I had a UTI   the meds they were giving me where a high dosage or I could n't take them
1	I was starting to cramp   bleed a few weeks later so I went to the ER
1	I was told that the baby had stopped forming   that I had miscarried but the baby was still there
1	I decided that I wanted to have a DC
1	after about a week or 2 after the procedure my fiance   I tried again
1	In the beginning of September we found out we were expecting again
1	I went to the ER   was told that I measured about 6 weeks   that there was a sac but no baby
1	I made an appointment with my OBGYN
1	My levels were tested   then a couple of days later they were tested again
1	The day after the last blood test which was last Wednesday I went to the doc   they did an ultrasound
1	The doc told me that my levels had dropped from 3000 to 1900 in just 3 or 4 days
1	Also no baby had started to form   I was almost 8 weeks then
1	I had a DC last Thursday
1	I was told that they are going to do lab work on my follow up appt to find out if there is a reason I miscarried twice in a row
1	I have an appt next week   then again 2 weeks after that
1	I 'm just kind of curious of a few things   also wanting some support that I know I can get here
1	I have n't really been able to talk to anyone about the miscarriage besides my fiance
1	I am curious as to if there is something wrong where maybe I ca n't have more kidsbut I have a son who is almost 3I'm curious as to if I would've waited a little longer if things would progressed but I know by almost 8 weeks you should see a baby
1	I am having drama with my family   my now ex best friend just betrayed me so I 'm kinda just looking for someone I can talk to
1	I have had trouble with anxiety for a few years now
1	Here lately I 've got to where I kind of space out like I forget where I am or what I 'm doing
1	I know my body is still a bit weak after my surgery a couple of weeks ago
1	I really just want some support because I do n't really talk to many people   I found medhelp after my first miscarriage in June   I have gotten so much support from people on here
1	and i live with my boyfriend baby daddy we also work together
1	He talks about killing me explicit detail he will put a knife to me and pretend to shoot me
1	we will get into an argument and i try to walk away cause i ve had enough an he will bind me an make me stay there get in my face and choke me until i complay to everything he sayshe is very verbally abusive i am schizo and well it dose not helpbut that is not my concernim worried about the reality of what he is cabable ofhe is very controling he says its cause he loves me to much to let me walk away but i know that s a bunch of bs
1	he broke the handle on our door so i ca nt just open it i half to take a butter knife to the door to open it
1	he wo nt let me have a phone and he wo nt let me go anywhere or do anything alone hince why we work together
1	he puched me once
1	if i leave i feel he will kill me
1	and i also think that he will fight me for the babyso what do i doi do nt really have any family and he has ran off all my friendsi do not think he will hurt the baby when we do fight he tells the baby he is sorry he dose not want to hurt you only your mommabut will he hurt me to the point of hurting his child without relizing is what i fear
1	So I am 17 , female and my boyfriend and I started engaging in sexual activities about 34 months ago
1	We have been together for a little more than 9 months
1	I have been off and on birth control orthocyclen generic brand but for the month of November I have taken them , and did n't miss a pill however did n't take all of them at the SAME TIME every day I only missed the last four dark green pills they contain no hormone so I do n't think it matters
1	Anywho here is what happened On around November the 3rd or 4th I got my normal period two days after , my bf and I got together
1	He fingered me first , I pulled my panties up , and with panties on only , I sat on top of him and gave him a hjob
1	When he began to ejaculate I jumped off , completely positive not getting any sperm on me except for my hands We both quickly wiped our hands on a pair of shorts kissed for a bit , then I went home
1	That night , ABOUT 1525 minutes later I was still extremely wet
1	Without thinking , I touched the inside of my vagina with that same hand just a bit to feel how wet I was to see if I had to clean up
1	My heart dropped and I washed my hands with soap and water
1	A few days later I DID THE SAME DAMN THING
1	Ugh anyways throughout that week , we fooled around but I was EXTRA cautious of everything I did
1	We dry humped , and I engaged in oral sex for him swallowed ANYWHO
1	It is now 2   2 12 weeks from that little incident , and I have about a week and four days until my period is suppose to come
1	That 's what my pills say Well , my breasts were and still get really sore
1	I also felt naseous a few times whether it 's my nerves or what idk and I had this liquids , waterlike and white discharge With worrying myself sick , I told my guardians and they both think I 'm crazy for thinking I 'm pregnant and even say that they think I did something more to be so worried about it
1	They bought me 2 first response pregnancy tests , and with about 912 days until my expected period , I took one and it came up negative with in 3 minutes today , I got my wisdom teeth out and the put me under with anesthesia
1	I was wondering , could that delay my period
1	Also , I got more discharge today , but this time it was white , with the consistency of elmers glue beginning to dry and clump
1	I also read online that you could have your period and still be pregnant
1	How the heck would you know if you were
1	Should I wait to take the second test a day after I get or do n't get my period when I 'm expected
1	Try to answer in much detail for my conscious sake THANK YOU AGAIN
1	I have had chronic cough issues now for 3 months , during these coughing spells I have had a hard , painful lump appear under left rib , when in bending position only if i m leaning over something , It goes away when I straighten up , it hurts like hell
1	I went to the doctor the firs time she felt there but said there s nothing , maybe muscle strain great right
1	Now when I sit there feels like something is there , however I ca n't feel it , there s a burning pain accompanying it
1	If i stand it feels ok , the burning is persistant today
1	Under my left rib in my waist line
1	It feels like it is blocking my stomach though , I been really sick recently and this appeared after a coughing fit , I assume hernia but I also have constipation problems I am being seen for a chest xray that was abnormal
1	Awaiting an appointment for an ultrasound for a lump I found in my breast
1	I feel a lot of pain in my upper back around my spine in the muscle
1	The past 34 years have been the worst year of my life
1	I had my first serious relationship when I was 1314 and I have never really got over him
1	Because of the relationship and the relationship between my dad 's partner and myself , I have nothing to do with my dad anymore
1	While I was in the relationship I got pregnant I was 14 please do n't judge , I know we were silly and me and my boyfriend tried to sort it but my mum found out and later that week I suffered a miscarriage but I still had to have an abortion and I had the vacuum aspiration type of abortion
1	Despite this , we got through it and still carried on our relationship for 6 months , in which my mum and grandparents put it behind them and learned to be okay with him
1	We then split up because he did n't love me anymore which sent me to have a mini breakdown
1	Since my dad made it clear he did not love me , I should have been used to being let down by the ones I love
1	His new girlfriend would send me threatening messages and once even waited at the end of my road so I could n't leave me house
1	Now I am 17 , and things have not been so good
1	At the beginning of this year I was the happiest I had been since my last relationship
1	I had started going out with a boy who I had so much in common with music , sense of humor and as soon as we saw each other , it was literally love at first sight
1	My cousin who I call my sister and my mum took to him warmly and his parents treated me like one of their own as well
1	Little did I know , he was actually depressed and on valentines day took an overdose
1	Long story short , we are not together pretty sure he cheated on me but I have become very reserved
1	I lose my temper so much and its usually my mum in the firing line
1	We kinda have a superficial relationship but I do love her
1	I have just finished my Alevels but the stress and pressure of everything got to me so much , I found an abscess on my bum which I did n't think anything of until I went to the doctors and it was severely infected
1	I was in so much pain I would cry everyday but it just did n't occur to get it checked out as my exams seemed more important than myself and my wellbeing
1	The doctor took one look at it and sent me straight to AE and 9 pm two weeks ago I was having emergency surgery to cut it out and drain it
1	The first thing I thought about when I woke up was about school as would of had my last exam two days after and the last thing I was thinking about was my wellbeing
1	I now have nurses come everyday to pack the open wound I have and am staying at my grandparents who are smothering me to death
1	I literally feel my blood boil everyday as my nan does n't leave me alone
1	I ca n't even move my foot without her asking me if I 'm okay
1	I know I should rest but she wo nt let me out
1	I have been prescribed with tramadol for the pain of packing the wound and she controls how many I take
1	I had an reaction from them but I still feel I need them
1	When I do n't have them I get sweaty and irritated and feel like I 'm on edge
1	Being in this house 247 is literally driving me insane and recently I have been talking to my ex boyfriend again the one from 34 it 's just a comfort thing and feelings come back
1	I just feel so anxious and hopeless and my anger is what I am most worried about
1	It does n't take me long before I lash out at someone and there has only been one occcasion where it has been violent with my mum , I did n't touch her but I smacked some papers she had in her hand and that is what scared me the most
1	As a little girl my grandfather molested me until he was caught by my mother
1	He was a cop and so was my dad at the time
1	In my early 20 's got involved with someone who told me   that was 20 years ago get over it when I was having issues in the bedroom
1	Years later he would brag to his friends how awesome i was in bed after my Ambien would take effect
1	After 19 years and 2 kids later I left after finding a tracking device in my car
1	I 've been on my own for 9 months the verbal abuse still continues   you are a bad person I 've had a male friend I 've known for 20 years one of my   best friends come into my life made me feel whole until we slept together 1 time Have n't heard from him since
1	Yesterday a cousin who I have n't heard from was texting about how perfect and hot I was and the stuff he wanted to do to me
1	I have n't talked to the guy in years
1	I trust not one word a single person says to me
1	HI i want to submit a problem which is very intricate and a big problem for my whole family
1	My sister 's age is 28 years and she is singleShe was a fat girl but she wanted to become smart and started dieting and did it too muchShe left eating and became smart maniacShe made a habbit to go up the stairs and down the stairs dailyThis is her routine exercise and now she is too weak that no one can say that it is hershe has got bony steucture and no flesh on themBut the more adveerse thing is that she is not leaving her this practiseShe does not take proper mealShe throws out the meal when no one is there and says that she has eaten upShe avoids eating before ushowever if we succeed to make her eat something she soon goes to stair and starts her exercise saying that she has eaten too muchwe have tried our best but she is not ready to listen us
1	The second matter is that she thimks that germs are all over hershe thinks that germs are flying in air and stick to our body and dressshe always goes on washing her hands with soapShe washes her hands not less than 30 times a dayShe avoids tuching any thing for example she does not open the door with her hands because she thinks that the handle of the door is full of germsshe opens it with her leg or footshe does not embrace anyperson because she thinks human is full of germsHowever if she happens to openclose the door , or shake hand to any one she rushes to the wash room and quickly washes her handsThis habbit is increasing and becoming more and more intenseNow she comes back from school , she is a school teacher she daily washes her dress with detergent saying that germs of children are in these dressshe daily does itShe avoids shaking hand to any one
1	This is a big problem for usPeople have noticed her these habbits and we get very embarassedIf we try to talk her on this matter politely , she becomes angry and annoyedAll of family members have tried their best nut to no progress
1	She thinks that we are backbiting her , whenever she looks rest of the family members sitting togetherIt is noteworthy that she avoids sitting with usShe thinks that all the family members are always talking about her and making a fun of herShe thinks that we are her enemiesShe becomes furious even if we talk her in the most polite mannerShe keeps herself busy in her these silent activites throughout the day that is exercise and washing hands and washing clothingsWe can not take her to the Dcotor because she becomes furious on that that i am not mad
1	I shall be thankful if you can give us any worth advise to come out of this situation because we love our sister
1	I have n't done this but I need help
1	I am only 14 and a freshman in high school and I feel things that I am pretty sure is depression
1	I do n't want to tell my mom because , she might think I am faking
1	But during the offseasons where I can not be near my team seems like an awful long time due to the fact that I just wish to die
1	I ca n't talk to my counselor in school , because I had sisters and brothers that went to her and she turned around and told my mom
1	I would suck it up and look forward to the future and what I dream about doing for the rest of my life
1	But I do n't dream and I used to know what I wanted until I started running track , and got all confused
1	I am surprisingly good at track for never running before high school , I even got a varsity letter and went to states
1	However I used to want to be like my sister and work in the fashion business
1	All I want to do in the end is make my parents proud , run track and not feel this way
1	I want someone to tell me how I can stop feeling depressed and alone , when I am surrounded by loving people
1	I 'm 17 years old and have lately felt as if I 'm in a deep dark pit and whenever I try to get out something is just pushing me back in
1	I started to worry about this feeling so I told my mom , she told me i 'm probably depressed so I told her to take me to someone to talk to , but she never did
1	I 'm popular and have many friends and hang out most of the time with my brother who is 19 years old , but I do homeschooling and my mom thinks that i 'm lonely and that is why I may be depressed
1	I 'm not lonely and knows that this is not my problem
1	when I exercise I feel bit better but only for an hour or two
1	I 'm also a diabetic and knows being emotional is not good for my bloodsugar levels , but besides that my bloodsugar levels is 99 of the time normal
1	I really do n't know what to do anymore and i do n't feel like talking about to my mom anymoreany advise what i could do
1	If one knew my husband they would be shock to find out what happened
1	Point is , he was also under extreme pressure at work
1	He had an affair without knowing he was cheating
1	I refuse that he takes medication because I feel he already has memory problems
1	I need to know if a person can indeed have a dissociation or was he victim of this person taken advantage of him while under influence
1	He remembers telling her he loves his wife when she brought her feelings forth the week prior to the operation
1	There is no way he would if risk our marriage
1	He ca n't even tell me why it happened nor how he justified it to himself
1	And does this mean , he could have indeed been unaware of his action
1	When I discovered thisz it had been three weeks since the operation and one day since he had stopped the medication
1	He was strange in his defense
1	Since then we have moved and have no jobs but we are together , both suicidal for we do n't understand how this could of happend
1	Agaib , he would of never done this to us I think
1	But I fear , I am at lost how to help myself stay alive , subsequently him also , for he ca n't imagine himself without me
1	I am 16 years old
1	For the past few weeks I have been bleeding from the vagina spottingit 's not like a period
1	I decided to check it out myself and manually felt in my vagina with a finger yes I basically fingered myself but for research purposes and felt a LUMP
1	I have felt up there before and I know that it absolutely was NOT there 3 weeks ago
1	I have already scheduled an obgyn appointment but I was hoping for some background from people who have had experience with vaginal cancer
1	My name is ALex and I am 23 years old
1	I was prescribed Zolof and and was moved up to 50 MG On Sept 10 I was very depressed and took 3 times my perscription 150MG I took it in the morning and that night my heart was racing 160 BPM I went to Emerge where they instructed me to not take Zolof until I speak to my family doctor
1	The following night I was rushed to hospital again with my heart at160 BPM again
1	I was realesed and the same thing happend the following night
1	I was then fine for two days but expericened extra and skiped beats
1	I spent 9 days in the hostpital with a racing and pounding heart where they checked for heart disease , ran an echo , they htought I was hypo clicimic which was rulled out , and they did a CT scan
1	I wore a helter moniter however unfortunitly I had no palviatations that day
1	I was realesed and my heaert was still pounding and was assured to saty off the Zolof
1	I started to loose my mind while in the hostpital and started to feel like I was dreaming
1	I was going through withdraw from the Zolof and felt I was going insane so I checked myself into a mental hostpital
1	I stayed one night and the Phsye doctor told me to go on 25 MG of Zolof
1	I feel slightly better however my heart will not stop racing and I never had this problem befor epriore to going on the medication
1	I have done numerouse ECG scans and they all are normal
1	TOday I went back to see the doctor and she told me to stop taking Zolof and take Clonazepam
1	Was htis caused by me taking the 150 MG on September 10
1	should I continue with the Zolof My heart does not pound as hard on Zolof but still races My heart prior to taking the 150 MG was perfectly fine
1	My chest hurts and my heart can Race for hours
1	I know I made a mistake however I am a young father and need to be a functioning espect in his life
1	It should also be noted that my T waves are very high and my potasium level is normal
1	ok i ve been reading a lot and i m kinda scarred
1	for awhile now i ve been day dreaming a lot I will have conversations with people in my head i could imagine i m talking to a close friend of mine or someone i do n't even know i do n't ever hear voices unless i m forcing it to happen i will sit in my room put my headphones on listen to music and just sit there and day dream all day long
1	but i m not loosing touch with reality i know the difference between one of my day dreams and reality sometimes i could even get angry in my day dreams and start arguing with someone who s made me mad or something
1	i read online about this thing called maladaptive day dreaming witch sounds a lot like what i have also i will sometimes go outside and pace around just walk around my yard and everywhere else and do this to but i never really get lost in the process
1	and i also have a social problem as well i hate bumping into people i know that a have n't seen in while and i get really scarred around people i do n't know sometimes if i m walking down the road and i see group of people walking towards me i will try nd avoid going past them because i m afraid they will judge me in some type of way what could this be i should also add that i do have anxiety maybe that will help but i do talk to my grandparents a lot and my sister and brother and i have a best friend who i hang out with as well i m not completely cut off from the outside world i also am 23 years old and i ve never had a job because i m afraid to be around people what do you think this is
1	Well i am not completely sure if this has anything to do with Depression , however i have noticed that my feelings towards my family are not as they should be
1	I do nt know why , It feels as if i may be searching for a new family
1	I do nt really want to be around them much and i do nt ever open up to them
1	They do give me lectures and yell and scream alot and they seem to be bringing lots of my anger and anxiety
1	They do nt mean to , infact things have improved , but i do nt know why i feel worse about them
1	i daydream about others being my family instead , eg my teachers or celecbrities on TV
1	I KNOW I AM A HORRIBLE PERSON
1	I feel so bad about it , but i ca nt help feeling this way
1	I do nt want to discuss any of my problems with them because it makes me feel really uncomfortable
1	So i try to avoid them and close myself up in my room
1	I do nt know what is wrong with mewhy am i not happy or comfortable with my family , while they love me to pieces
1	I 've been dealing with depression and self harm for about 7 years
1	I , only 3 years ago when it started getting worse , got help and began meds
1	I 've been on meds ever since trying every drug out there and I finally found one that makes me feel better
1	I began cutting when I was 12 and it always madero feel better
1	Then I moved to duller objects and started rubbing my skin hard
1	I have not self harmed in 2 weeks
1	But I 'm getting more anxious as time goes by and I 'm feeling the need to self harm more and more
1	I 'm feeling so depressed lately I want to take all of my meds
1	But my medications I 'm prescribed are very thought out
1	The combination of all my meds would make me barely drowsy and most likely nauseous
1	I 'm just so stressed out I have a million things running through my mind and I do n't know what most of tem are because they 're moving to fast
1	I feel like my head is going to explode
1	Hi I 'm 24 years old and I have this large and obvious lump on my right clavicle , I can see it in the mirror , it is hard and feels bony , it is not tender and there is no pain when I touch or press it , there is also another lump on the top of my shoulder , it looks as if the bone on top of my shoulder is just jutting out of its place , I do n't have any pain , but some times I get this extreme feeling of discomfort like I need to move my arm somehow or stretch , my shoulder blade also has the same feeling of discomfort and there is always this feeling as if my bones are grating against something when I move my shoulder , so far my doctor said its just a real bad case of tendonitis , but I 'm really not convinced , I 've had this case for almost two months or so now and have n't exercised for the past two weeks and still there is no improvement and very recently for the past week or so , since my last Dr visit I would some times get pain in the bicep that could radiate down to the forearm or elbow it would only last a couple of seconds and is not really significant , it does n't really stop me from moving my arms or distract me from my worketc
1	Also today while just rubbing my head I noticed this really tiny pea sized , very hard , solid bump on top of my head , on the right side , above the forehead and right at the place where the hairline ends , it feels like its part of or fixed on my skull , there is no pain when I press on it but skin moves on top of it freely and it remains fixed in place , I have no idea how long its been there
1	My sister has BPD , I 'm convinced and has all the signs eating disorder , impulsive spending , uncontrolable rage at times , peppered with sentimental feelings , instable relationships , impulsive she married two men she barely knew , one after 8 weeks and the other the first time she met him , instability at her professional job , she lost two jobs for refusing to do what her bosses asked her to do and for angry outbursts with them and others in the building , disconnect with her children although she loves them her preoccupation with herself gets in her way of caring for them properlyand she 's been on antidepression medication all her life My question   with parents and siblings that do not want to name this thing and my parents who are emeshed with her and refuse to stop enabling her emotionally and physically how do I set boundries for my self
1	My mother is the worst and I simply can not be around when the two of them are together
1	It 's as if NO ONE else is important and she has to support her daughter of course this is at the expense of the rest of us because my mother is simply obsessed with my ailing sister
1	How do I have a relationship with them
1	How do I set boundries when we only see eachother around holidays no , we are grown
1	Hi , I am 16 female and I know it 's normal to have depression at my age but for the last 34 months I have been having other problems
1	It 's hard to fall asleep at all , I end up staying up as late as 4 am even on school nights , I 'm seeing things that are n't really there mostly when I 'm reading
1	it happens a lot and I end up questioning what I 'm reading if what its saying is true or not
1	When I do sleep my dreams are sad at first and become nightmares
1	I eat pretty healthy for a teen and do n't do drugs or drink , I 'm also not sexually active but I have been having throbbing pains in my bowels and no at those times I do n't have to use the bathroom
1	It 's also getting harder to stand up , I 'm not over weight and I do n't find it hard to walk it 's just my body does n't seem to want to say up right
1	My heart jumps a lot too making me have to take in more air which only makes me dizzy and every once in a while I get a stabbing pain on the left side of my head
1	I have n't hit my head since I was a child and there are no cuts or anything I could see to answer why there 's pain there
1	It might just all be in my head but I am getting worried so if anyone can give an answer that would be grate
1	I am 16 years old , and I am a High School Dropout
1	Had 2 counselors , found it to be ineffective after working with them for 3 years
1	Enjoys playing online games with people I have met online Pretty good online friends , but have never met them in real life 11
1	HUGE liar All the things listed above may all be lies , but I can not control my lies and sometimes I am not sure if they are lies or truths 13
1	Have absolutely no talent I do not want to argue with this point , please assume that this is the ultimate truth There are probably dozens more that I can say about myself , but I think this is enough for now
1	Basically , I am going through a tough time in my life , and I do not know what to do
1	Ultimately , however , all my problems that I am going through boils down to two things Puberty and Laziness
1	My older sister has gone through similar experience as I did , and she is doing completely fine right now in college , finding passion , falling in love , making tons of connections
1	Puberty and Adolescence is definitely a major factor for my Depression
1	Whatever I do , boredom consumes me and I give up no matter what I do
1	I want to receive some help or advice on what I can do in my life from now on
1	Here are some of the decisions that I have made , and they will not be reconsidered or changed
1	Rotting in my room for the next x years is not gon na make my passion come to me 3
1	5 years ago I went through some hard times so my doctor put me on 20 mg fluoxetine which really helped the depression I was having , but it also made me feel really wired , sweaty , and hyper
1	I stayed on them for about a year and decided to stop because it seemed like life had calmed down for me
1	Lately I 've been having a rough go of it again and have those old feelings creeping back even after seeing a counselor for two years
1	Though I have learned a lot there and feel the advice makes sense , I have so much trouble keeping my emotions in check and can often fly off the handle with them , having episodes of tears for two days straight and feeling like doomsday is coming
1	I feel as though it 's time to medicate myself again so that I can live a life of quality instead of mental anguish
1	My current doctor asked if I 'd like to try taking a 5 mg dose of fluoxetine and see if it might work a little better for me this time
1	So far it 's been ten days and I 'm feeling the exact opposite side effects that I felt 5 years ago on a higher dose
1	I 'm so curious as to why it 's affecting me so differently this time
1	I am 19 years old and just 6 weeks ago I found out I was 30 weeks pregnant
1	I am now 36 weeks and 1 day
1	I want to say that I promise this is n't a joke , and this really is n't a lie
1	And I 'm posting on here because I 'm scared , I have a lot of questions and I 'd really like some support and some good answers
1	6 weeks ago , i woke up in the morning with my stomach really tight and hard to the point where it was unbearably uncomfortable
1	I called my mom from my room and let her feel my stomach
1	She immediately told me something did n't seem right and said we should go to the doctor
1	I went to my family doctor and he came in and did a check up , and felt my stomach
1	He looked at me funny and said I would like for you to go get some xrays
1	Obviously he thought that I could be pregnant because I had been to the doctor before for Xrays and he never referred me to get a pregnancy test first
1	Although I knew there was no possible way I could be pregnant because I was having my regular periods they were usually months apart because I had irregular periods So I agreed to go get a test at the hospital
1	I had no idea this could have happened and never thought it would happen to me
1	The doctor came in and said that he needed to admit me to a room and start me on an iv because they had no idea how far along I could be and also the baby has had no prenatal care
1	They gave me something to put on and the doctor came in
1	She felt my stomach to find my uterus to see about how far along she thought I was and it was already above my belly button
1	And said You are about 2830 weeks pregnant I looked at her in disbelief
1	They took me in to do an emergency ultrasound and it turned out I 'm having a healthy baby girl
1	It 's been 6 weeks , and now that I know I 'm pregnant I 've been eating as much as I want and can so I 've grown some
1	If i can sit through a large tattoo on my ribs will an epidural hurt
1	I 'm getting better about not bein scared about labor but I 'd like to hear some answers and story 's to make me feel better
1	Hi , I 'm a 30 year old female
1	Within the past year , I 've noticed that my periods have stopped for the months that I was away in the other city , but return once I came back to my hometown
1	I went to my doctor because I was concerned that I have been experiencing water weight gain for approximately a year now
1	I do n't sleep well through the night when I 'm away from my home town , and the sporadic nature of my menstrual cycle gave me the greatest concern
1	I feel constantly alert and stressed until I get back to my hometown
1	My doctor did a blood test to check my hormone levels , and my estrogen levels where normal
1	However , my FSH and LH levels were 135pgml for FSH and 889pgml for LH
1	My last menstrual cycle was at the beginning of June of 2011 , and it is almost August , now
1	I 've been reading a bit about Temporary Menopause related to Traumatic Stress
1	Hello It all started over a year and a half ago one night I woke up out of a sleep and my whole body was numb I could not feel anything I stumbled to the bathroom and told my family to call 911 I thought I was dieing from a heart attack
1	They came right away about ten minutes later they checked my vitals I was fine I could start feeling again before they showed up and after that night I was never the same
1	I would go numb every once in a while and after a couple minutes come back around to feel again
1	I have been hit in the head several times in the past do n't know if that has to do with anything but last November it got worse after someone hit me in the head for the tenth time I was ok for about a month then It keep getting worsei am dizzy all day everyday I have pain behind my eyes and headaches and neck pain everyday it is hard to move my eyes side to side I get very dizzy easily I have chest pain and head pressure
1	If I do n't keep it cool or the air conditioner on me and get ice I get more dizzy
1	I feel like I 'm not all there anymore like I 'm slowly dieing
1	I have an irregular heart beat and get flutters a lot I was diagnosed with atrial fibleration of the heart
1	I have chest pains mostly after I eat and all day right between my rib cage connects in the middle right below my heart
1	The doctors did all kinds of tests ca n't find nothing except recently a doctor found out I am severly anemic my blood cell count is very low and he do n't know why just yet more tests
1	I have taken the speed pills phentermine on and off in the past for weight loss I am not over weight now but I was before I took speed just wondering if it messed my heart valve up or if getting hit in the head so much caused my problems or something else more serious going on please anyone who could help or know something please let me know
1	I am 39 and have a family history of women who start as early as 30 but my doctor does n't want to believe it so therefore he will not test me
1	I did those homes tests and they say yes but he said those tests are n't real
1	I know the truth and will just have to wait till I 'm at the age he deems old enough to get some attention in that department
1	My question is since he wo nt even talk about it is having several periods in your cycle normal
1	I 've always ran every 28 days , 4 days 2 on , 1 off , 1 on for many years
1	Since I was about 35 I started having 2 a month sometimes and even 3 this 28 day cycle
1	I got some bloating , start day fatigue and some breast tenderness but nothing I could really whine about
1	Now however I am like the poster child for PMS
1	My breast feel like lead weights are in them for about 34 days before and a day or so after , my normal 4 day cycle has lasted 56 some times , especially on the extra Aunt Flo visit and I cramp like crazy
1	I never knew cramping till now and do n't get me started on Hot Flashes
1	My husband gets rather upset when I have to go stand outdoors in the middle of the night to cooldry off
1	I have a 4yr old daughter with my boyfriend who has a 14yr old son
1	We have been together for over 5yrs we are happy and of course have our issues and work through most of them one we ca n't seem to work through is his sons attitude there is a clear pattern of of his son acting out , and my boyfriend saying he ca n't do anything because of his mother
1	I end up getting fed up and try forcing it and that leads to me feeling hated and belittled by both of them
1	When the son is behaving and doing what is expected things are great , i know his triggers and try by all means to avoid them , lately when i correct him , because of his swearing , he drops the F bomb , he claims he an adult and can do what he wants
1	That i ca n't take his tv or xbox away bc its his
1	So within the last week he had a friend stay against my wishes ,   i caved   i know he acts out tries to show off but it ends in his dad getting frustrated and then our daughter not listening , i went to bed and for an hour herd him and his friend wrestling around or doing whatever they were doing , and got up and gave them hell , he said they were n't doing anything but they calmed right down i awoke the next morning to him screaming shoot that Fucker xbox and then proceeded to say it over and over again , if i do nt hear it i do nt care
1	I corrected or attempted again and got a lie , told him one more time and the xbox is offcouple hours later the xbox was off and his dad was calling him
1	They argued for a good 1015 mins
1	We all made plans but because the son shut down i was left to them by myself and came home to find the son is never going to give me a chance bc he assumes his dad and mom are going to get back together and i had to fish for that after 5 years of being together i would think i have every right to be in the family discussion after father and son talk but no regardless of that i say take stuff away if he 's not going to listen to me or his father
1	This is going to be very difficult for me to explain as i do not fully understand it myself
1	I have been sad for about 5 years now and i am 19
1	I am almost constantly filled with emptiness and i feel dead through most of my days
1	I often awake and feel horrible the second i become concious
1	I become so filled with anger very easily even at mild inconviences even when i am aware it is unreasonable to be so mad
1	I 'd explain how i feel as absolutely unsure and confused about everything
1	Not so literal but deep inside me i am just completely confused about everything
1	I am not sure if i have made a real connection with anybody in a long time
1	I do have friends but i am not close with them and i feel completely alone
1	Infact all of my real thoughts have been somewhat trapped in my head the past 5 years
1	I often feel like i am literally driving myself insane
1	I ca n't quite explain it but i just am not sure if my head works the same as others
1	Another thing is i see people and they seem to be filled with so much more than me
1	They seem to have so much life , so much personality , they seem to have some understanding i do nt have and it makes me feel so unhuman
1	I believe i have social anxiety or i am actually positive as i stress on talking to anybody i do not already know
1	I get so overwhelmingly nervous when talking to people and have the most unsettleing feeling in my stomache
1	I know it is unreasonable and i tell myself i do nt care about what people think but its like subconciously i care so much and can not help the feeling from coming over me
1	This is even worse when talking to girls as i stress i will look dumb , uninteresting , and when it comes down to it i plain do nt know what to say frequently
1	I feel absolutely worthless and like i am literally less than everyone else
1	I feel so alone and have n't had a girlfriend since 6th gradeso technically never I really worry i will never meet a girl i could connect with and this kind of makes me feel hopeless
1	To me finding love sounds like just about the only beautiful and happy thing that could happen to me
1	I do nt much want a great career or alot of moneyatleast as of now i just really wish i had someone who understood me
1	I just hate myself for were i ve gotten myself , all alone and absent of human affection
1	I am aware its my fault for not being comfortable with myself but its like i ca nt help myself
1	I ca nt reassure myself because i feel so confused about everything
1	It seems some nights i will feel i have a better grasp of my thoughts and start to feel a little more confident in who i am but then other nights it seems i lose all those thoughts and am left with nothing and just am completely unsure about who i am
1	I do n't know if this has played a roll in it but i have taking a liking to psychedelic substances
1	At first they would give me some understanding and a feeling of calmness
1	But recently they have only left me more confused and my mind completely scrambled
1	I do not do this to that much of an extent and actually am stopping due to them giving me more anxiety
1	Other things is my dad has bipolar disorder which i do not think i have from what i ve read but i have no clue because i ca nt seem to be positive about anything
1	As ridiculous as this is going to sound it almost feels as if i have a block in my head
1	Like something that is stopping me from furthing my understanding of myself or any of the questions i have
1	It probably sounds ridiculous and i may be searching for answers i have nt fully developed or have the capability of answering
1	I just wish i could feel comfortable and at ease with myself
1	I think of suicide everyday at almost every inconvienice or disapointment
1	I day dream of dying most of my days like getting into a car accident while i m driving or even illogical scenerios like just being shot in the head but some gunman
1	I do not think i would actually kill myselfas of now because i do have a grandma that cares about me and we are pretty much all we have but sadly i still feel completely alone
1	I feel i have not written it to completely explain what s wrong with me because i can not understand or explain it correctly but this is pretty much how i feel
1	I do not know what to do and i am beggining to feel i will just feel this way and be alone until i kill myself because i honestly do nt think i can live a full life feeling how i do now
1	Hello , my name is Chelsea and I 'm 17 years old
1	By the time I turned 10 , I was extremely shy and I had a very small friend group
1	I went three years like this , making no friends and I was terrified of anyone that disliked me
1	I kept my distance
1	I had one friend from my primary school
1	It turns out that she was a fake and used me for information
1	She took all of my secrets and posted them online
1	I was younger , my hormones were crazy , my anxiety was explosive and I 'd cry and the thought of going outside
1	When them secrets got online , they spread
1	My Facebook was full of nasty comments , I got nasty phone calls
1	Life was hell and I honestly did consider suicide , although I would n't of had the guts to do it
1	Since that day , my life has been better
1	I have friends , I do n't get bullied and to be honest , I love that feeling
1	My step dad died about 4 months ago , something weird started to happen to me
1	I loved that man like he was my real father
1	He practically raised me
1	If one of the boys in my class were to make a snide comment on how I looked or anything to that sort
1	One snide comment would leave me horrifyingly upset for about a week straight
1	Teachers would yell at me for walking out of class due to being upset , at that point I go crazy
1	When this happens I generally feel like I ca n't control myself
1	I was extremely quiet for those months
1	This made stuff even worse at home Every single day I felt like I was alone , I liked it that way
1	I did n't want to be around anyone other than my internet friends
1	During these days I would come home , turn on my Pc and spend my days talking to my friends and playing games with them on Steam
1	When I was upset , they 'd help me
1	Unlike any of my Friends in real life I like being alone all the time now
1	I 'm constantly achy , tired and I have n't been bothered to do anything I used to love doing , like art and dance
1	When I get angry , I do n't know why
1	I 'll then burst in to tears because I 'm scared and do n't know why I 'm angry
1	For the rest of what happens I feel like I do n't control
1	Sorry if this is repetitive but I 'm struggling to explain my situation I 've had 7 weeks off school and I 've been inside , every single day
1	On my Pc , coding games , helping my friend with his website and generally just having fun
1	But yesterday I 've came to terms that I go back to school in 4 days
1	The depression has hit me again and even thinking about going back makes me burst out in to tears and not want to live
1	My school tried to give me a referral to orchard house Hospital , Mental care place Even after not asking what was wrong with me
1	They thought I was just mental and crazy
1	I really wish someone would understand me My life has been a roller coaster , full of ups and downs
1	Right now , I 'm at one of my lowest points and I really need some help
1	Please , please comment on here and give me some advice on what to do and tell me why I feel like this
1	I want to know why I feel this way
1	I want to know why I get so angry
1	People have said it could be imbalanced hormones , but I doubt it could get as extreme as I have been
1	I really need my head to be cleared

1	i feel out of place i geuss is what i have been trying to say please HELP ME
1	tell me something even if its i lost my mind
1	I 'm 14 and really petrified by all of this
1	Basically i 'm hearing these voices like faint ones but i feel as if they 're getting louder and louder , if i 'm walking in the streets they will tell me to kill or seriously hurt the people or even rob them and i always so NO
1	to them and they say ' ' you know you really want to '' and then i reply no again so then i would just try and ignore , also 247 i feel like someone or people are spying on me like i ca nt get changed in my room because i feel like there is a secret camera somewhere and then if i walk into a room i always feel everyone is looking and talking about me , i ca nt walk down a road without thinking ' ' omg someone is going to kill or kidnap or hurt me '' and if i 'm sitting down or lying down i see things move like i see the walls closing in or i will see a spider or a creature moving and i feel that if i turn on the tv a face will pop up and say ' ' i will kill you '' and my sleep is bad i wake up really early like 200am 5 am or 67am but before i sleep i drop into a strong delusion where i will hear life threatning voices like screaming and voices saying you have to die then the screams carry on like its never ending it always happens before i fall asleep
1	So I believe I 've suffered from some bipolar or other related disorder since early childhood
1	I remember wishing I were dead when I was about nine or ten
1	From age 8 and up I 'd just set on a rock on my hill and thoughts would practically hammer in my head
1	Like why should I even bother who cares you 're not worth anything anyways
1	I always have and probably will always have suicidal impulses I always have the urge to jump off cliffs or out of a speeding car
1	I pretty much have sat and thought up how many ways I could die
1	Because I ca n't get those   thoughts about how I 'm not good enough to go away
1	I think I hear people talking outside my window when I 'm trying to sleep and everytime I close my eyes and just about fall asleep I see this oustandingly horrifying monster watching me
1	Wakes me dead up I tell you what
1	Then sometimes I get to where I sleep up to 16 hours a day and am still tired
1	I believe i ve had two major depressions in my life between 12 and 15
1	I know half of the stuff I do and think is senseless
1	I 've tried my Mother just keeps telling me I need to snap out of it but I ca n't
1	I ’ve been dealing with this for as long as I can remember
1	I ’m adopted and I ’ve also read online that kids who are adopted may have attachment problems when they get older and may have problems establishing relationships for fear of rejection
1	Also , the child might not be “ cuddly or touchyfeely ” my mom constantly TELLS me , how much I do n’t love her because I never hug her
1	She does n’t even ask me if I love her or not … she tells me I do n’t
1	Tonight , we were driving home and she told me that I have no sympathy or empathy for anyone and that if she was laying in the road that I would run over her
1	And she talks over me every time I try and justify that she ’s wrong
1	Back to the adoption thing , she tells me how my parents must ’ve been murders and liars and   because I ’m nothing like her and how she ’s raised me
1	She says she ’s going to send me away to a boarding school and goes , “ If you do n’t want to be here so bad , if you hate me so much that you have to hurt me then just go away
1	I ’ll take a second loan on the house just go away to a boarding school ” when I tell her that I do n’t want to leave she just says , “ I can never tell with you , you always act so depressed ” She says she ’s going to send me back to the orphanage and that she did n’t have to love me , she does n’t have to love me … and that she does n’t
1	So I tell her that I do n’t love her either
1	But I do because , she ’s my mom and she ’s not always so mean
1	She gets really mad at me for not cleaning my room and miscommunications and calls me stupid and a   and tells me I ’m going to hell where all the rapists and murders are because I did n’t clean my room
1	Sometimes she ’s really nice and buys me things , she ’s a school teacher and a very smart person
1	I think she ’s just very very stressed because after she gets mad and does all these mean things she calls me into her room and talks to me more nicely
1	She does n’t apologize , but I never noticed until now and she says that I ’m smart but she does n’t know why I do such stupid things
1	And she twists my words when she s calm and says , “ I know exactly what I said , I did n’t call you stupid I said you act stupid ” My friends have noticed too , and their parents have noticed that my mom is very controlling , I have to call her everynight I ’m at a friend ’s house , even when I ’m not staying over or she gets very mad
1	“ I asked you to do one simple thing and you forgot , you never remember a damn thing ” My friends notice my mom blaming me for everything , everything
1	When they mention it to me I get defensive and brush it off like nothing
1	Do n’t even get me started on grades in school … I read that people who are mentally abused grow up to be violent or temperamental or just have low self esteem and confidence
1	I have a lot of friends and everyone things I ’m super funny and nice and pretty artistic
1	I only think I ’m dumb and worthless right after the verbal abuse … but the next day being “ dumb and worthless ” is n’t the only thing I think about
1	Also my mom gets super mad and then there ’s like a two day period of walking on egg shells and minor peace and then she explodes again and then tells me how much she loves me
1	She threatens to call the police to have them come and talk to me about being a bad child and tells me I should go to a shrink because “ Normal people do n’t think ” the way I do or Act the way I do or Talk … And she yells at me for not making her a card that says “ sorry ” on the front for what I did wrong
1	My grandfather died and she said “ When my grandpa died I wrote my parents a letter saying how much I loved him and how much I respected him and miss him
1	What do I get from you
1	I would think that you know by now ” My question Is … Since it ’s not regular every day verbal abuse …
1	And since I ’m not showing any signs of a verbal abuse victim … do I count as a verbal abuse victim
1	I love my momP even if she tells me I do n’t , I do
1	A few weeks ago , I went to a doctor Internal Medicine because I was experiencing dizziness especially when I study
1	He diagnosed me with vertigo
1	He prescribed SERC 16 mg
1	After a few days , I went to an another doctor EENT who also ruled out that it was vertigo
1	She prescribed SERC 24 mg
1	After a week when the medicine she prescribed ran out , I went to see the latter to have a followup check up
1	I told her that I would feel pressure in my head only when I study
1	I could still maintain my balance
1	She then told that it might be related to my brain so she made a request slip for a CT SCAN
1	He suggested that I would go to a neurologist
1	However , I can not go there yet since my card is not available for any neurologist in our city
1	So my problem is there would be pressure in my head when I start studying and it gets worse when I continue
1	I have vulvar Bowen 's disease and Squamous Cell Carcinoma
1	I am negative for all HPV high and low risk
1	My margins were not clear so I have had 2 minor surgeries and am waiting for a 2nd opinion on my slides and news on margins
1	I am concerned because my glands have become tender in my groin , armpit and neck since biopsy
1	The Dermatologist says I have probably been exposed to Arsenic many years ago
1	My Father also had Bowen 's and Melanoma
1	So when I found this painless , flat lavender spot on me I rushed to the Doctor
1	It has been 16 days since my first biopsy
1	If my margins are not clear I am being referred to a Onc Gyne for further treatment
1	I was told I will have to be checked every 3 months
1	I am 55
1	What I read on exposures is that it takes decades for the effects to show upwhat is your feeling on this
1	My Father had Bowen 's
1	He had numerous melanomas but they were all caught early
1	He also had bladder cancer , lymphoma and died from liver cancer from metast Melanoma
1	I have been healthy other that developing Hashimoto 's and a multinodular goiter 2 years ago
1	I also had shingles 2 years ago
1	I started dating a guy about a year and a half ago
1	Took me on dates , made me feel wanted
1	Was great with affection until I caught him talking to his ex and 2 other girls he engaged sexual activities with
1	I at the time did n't care much because it was at the beginning of our relationship
1	Later he confessed to trapping me while I was pregnant he hit me threw me around and verbally abused me
1	I noticed in the night he was always using the bathroom every time I got up
1	I left a recorder one day while I left to pick up the kids
1	Sounds like he turned on the water put the coffee pot on and just sounds of banging and him saying I 'm about to come
1	He Denys it even when I play it he says it was him washing something in the sink
1	We move to another state and at this point he noticed that I was recording
1	I got up to my recorder stopped and turned back on by him so he can act like my iPhone cut off and started recording magically on it own when he was up
1	I changed the password and did n't notify him and that night I recorded
1	We were staying with friends and when I listen to the recordings he gets up and you hear a door open then you hear mosning and again water running in the back to drown noises out
1	When I confronted him he again hit me
1	Said I was crazy
1	We have a 5 month old daughter , which I had carried on a few occasions that he 's beat me
1	I have 4 kids of my own that hear the yelling and him cussing me out
1	If I leave he says he 'll come after me and because that 's his daughter he 'll do anything to take her away and make my life a living hell
1	I 'm now homeless because of all these issues and he 's still following me everywhere I go so I have to go along with we are together
1	He yells at me out side , cops even warned him one time he slapped a drink out of my hand and a by stander called them because he head butted me and left me on the ground
1	I was too scared to fess up to it because he was there
1	None of which affect me being an awesome mom for the past 16 yrs
1	Himy name is Laura and about 5 months ago we bought a new house
1	During the week we were making offers on the house I went thru the most stressful period I have ever gone thru
1	I mean , I had severe stomach problems during that week , bouts of crying and depressionit was horrible
1	To say the least , after the final offer was made and the deal was set in motionI acquired a discomfortpain under my rib cage on the left side
1	It radiates from the upper front of my rib cage to the lower back and fluctuates from a sharp like stitch like when you walk or run to fast to dull annoying discomfort
1	Also , I have found that when my mind is busy , it does nt bother me at all
1	I swear I have a tumor , because when I lay on that side it feels like something is therebut to touch in that area I feel nothing
1	I m just wondering if the stress of that week and the stress of moving and trying to sell the other house is or could be causing my problem
1	I have not been to see a doctor for fear of getting bad newsI know , stupidbut I m scared
1	So taking a quick glance through the rest of this topic , I realize that I 'm in a far better position than most , situationwise
1	My parents are still together and healthy even though my father can have some incredibly ish moments from time to time , I have n't experienced death really at all in my life other than one grandparent when I was 10 , and I 'm in a serious , loving and considerably happy relationship
1	So I guess I feel like I do n't really have the right to feel depressed , given the situations of most other people
1	But that does n't stop me from looking for help , and seeing as my boyfriend is unavailable right now , I 'm not all that comfortable talking to my mother , and friends are a luxury I do n't exactly possess here I am
1	My name is Lauryn and I 'm 17 , and though I have n't been properly diagnosed , there 's a hell of a lot of evidence to suggest I suffer from some kind of anxiety disorder , possible aspergers , depression and a pretty obscure personality disorder
1	All except from the last I 've had for as long as I can remember
1	I 've lost every single close relationship I 've had throughout my life with the exception of my boyfriend , including a best friend of over 5 years quite recently
1	I 've lost all interest in things I enjoyed that I could possibly make a future out of art and writing which has caused me to be absent from Sixth FormCollege for over 4 weeks now and also have absolutely no hope for my future whatsoever
1	I 've had quite a lot of suicidal thoughts as of late and I 've begun selfharming again after over a year
1	The only time I actually feel any kind of happiness is when I 'm with my boyfriend , and I was supposedly referred for professional treatment a few weeks ago
1	I honestly do n't know what I expect to gain from this
1	I 'm scared to do that with my boyfriend in case he realizes just how damaged I really am and stops wasting his time on me   or he does n't but I waste the time dwelling on negatives and miss my window to be happy for the day
1	And I 've also tried to find and sign up to teenage depression support forums , but attempts at that were unsuccessful , and hotlines and the such are out of the question because I 'm really quite   terrified of physically speaking to people I do n't know
1	Just as a kind of sidenote , I 'm really not usually as brash as I 've probably come across writing this
1	Tonight is just one of those rare occasions where I feel anger , sadness and hopelessness instead of the plain old hopeless sadness
1	Also , I 'm aware I use far too many words like really , quite , slightly etcI ca n't for the life of me remember the name for those types of words In a strange way , they 're kind of like a weird comforting mechanism
1	Hi and thank you for taking the time to read my post
1	I have been seeing doctors about my leg pain for over two years
1	They diagnosed me with fibromyalgia which I do n't agree with because at he time the only pain I had was leg pain and chronic fatigue because I am always exhausted
1	I recently became sick with a cough and they did a chest xray and found increased markings and then did another one a month later and same findingsboth radiologists recommended CT scan doc says he does n't think I need it and to wait another six weeks for another xray
1	Now I am having pain on my shoulder blade I did n't have an injury to it have n't seen the doc yet
1	Also I failed to mention before the leg pain began I had a lumpectomy because I had a lump that came back atypical after biopsy
1	They never gave me a script for mammogram either because I was so young
1	I also have a lump on my sternum and few symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer as we 'll
1	So I am very worried that some of these things could be related and I do n't want to go to the doctors and tell them all this and they think I 'm a loon
1	First off , let me tell you a little bit about myself
1	I am 14 years old , I enjoy skateboarding which I am not very good at , playing guitar , reading , and writing music
1	My favorite authors are Kurt Vonnegut , Stephen King , and Edgar Allan Poe
1	Music is one of my favorite things in life although I do n't consider it to be my life , mainly because the majority of people who say those kinds of things listen to meaningless music anyway
1	I 'm not talking about Foster the People and Fun , I 'm talking about synthynoone'severheardofthisalternative
1	Although some of my favorite bands listed tend to create quite bizarre and disturbing lyrics , I can find deep meaning in them
1	I ca n't stand the world around me , I feel as if I am the only person who sticks out and realizes the reality of life around here
1	I spend lots of time on the internet , mainly because it helps to take my mind off of things , I suppose
1	I really do not know where my depressive fits have started from , but I think most of it comes from analyzing the bleak , bleak world around me
1	She 's the most beautiful girl I 've ever met , and she has an amazing personality and we connect on so many levels that it 's unreal
1	Her and I hung out a lot last summer , which is when I ultimately fell in love with her
1	She rejected me before we started hanging out much , and then I suppose she felt bad for me and started to text me more
1	This only increased my feelings for her
1	After a few months of her flirting with me nonstop and calling me the best friend she 's ever had , I was almost certain she loved me
1	She was texting me every day , and it was n't out of sympathy anymore
1	She even told me that she loved me several times
1	I did n't want to ask her out , because it would be embarrassing as hell if I got rejected twice by the same person , who also had become my best friend
1	Currently , I 'm a freshman and she 's a sophomore
1	She 's doing threeandout , meaning she 's doing good enough in school that she can graduate Junior year , which makes me feel young and inferior towards her
1	I often worry about if she sees me as being too young to date
1	Anyway , I think this is enough general information to see what I have going on
1	I really ca n't tell what 's making me depressed , so if anyone here could find some sort of psychological meaning in this , then that would be wonderful
1	this happens to me time and again , and mainly when i get depressed , but i can not eat , the thought and sight and even smell of food makes me want to be sick , i will be really hungry but will not eat , i can try and eat , like a sandwich but ill end up gagging and will have to get it into my stomach as fast as i can , and hold the fact i m about to regurgitate it in , because i can only force myself to be sick even when i m really ill , there s so many thing that i really want to eat , but i ca nt cause my mind and my stomach is telling me that i ca nt , before when this used to happen it lasted for a long time , this has been going on for two years constantly on and off , and the longest its happened is for a month and i really do not know what i am going through , i have nt been able to go see a gp about them because the surgery where i live is always busy even before the phone lines are open , i would really like to know what is wrong with me and how i can sort it before it gets extreme
1	Well , as my previous post talked about the extreme emotional abuse I am having with my mother , things are just NOT getting better , and to be honest , it 's taking it 's toll on me
1	I attempted to tell her how my dr appt went regarding the Strong progression of the MS , and she basically wanted to hear no part of itI tried to tell her how I have to have more tests based on how fast the MS is eating my body up , how I feel about it all , my fear , sadness , whatever , and like I said , SHE WANTED TO HEAR NO PART OF IT
1	And that is just tearing me up insideHow and Why would a mother not want to knowwhat this is doing to meI just CAN NOT understand why she is so STUCK in her feelings that I am such a loser , burden , that I 'll NEVER go anywhere 's or BE anythingWhy she could give a   that I am suffering in just about EVERY level of my lifeI just feel like ever since I was Dx'd she hates me even moreI ca n't convince her I NEVER asked to get sick , and never planned on this just bringing me down so fastShe has repeatedly told me or made me feel that I am a loser , I am a disgrace , I am just never gon na be anybodyAnd it 's REALLY bringing me downI just wish and pray I can get out of hereaway from her , and try to PROVE I 'm NOT a loser , burden , disgrace , or whatever else she sees me asBut , I can tell ya thisnow and with all that I feel , I can CLEARLY see why people concider ending it
1	Not from the MSend the pain from her
1	Sometimes actually alot of times I just think If I take a whole bunch of my Vicodin and Neurontin pills , then I can END the pain , sadness , being a loserburden , feelings I am feeling
1	It 's like everyday I want to just end it allOk , I know I have not been an Angel , that I 've made mistakes in my life , I know I 've let people down and whatever , but my question is why would someone WANT to go on , in this fashion
1	I 'll tell ya thisI am so sicktired of being treated like SH , sick of being told over and over I 'm a loser , I 'm a disgrace to the family , tired of feeling like it WOULD be better for everyone IF I WAS'NT around anymore , tired of being alone every damn day by myself
1	Nobody callsnobody visitsnobody does ANYTHINGIt 's like IF I did end it all with my pillsit would be DAYS before ANYONE WOULD KNOW ABOUT IT , CUZ NO ONE EVER CALLS OR COMES AROUND
1	But , right now , I just feel it would be in EVERYONE 'S best interest if I do just do what I have to to end my painsadnesslonlinessIt would be like my final gift to myselfI'm sorry to dump all this out there to you guysit 's just I can not take anymore
1	The pain of what my mother says to me , the way she is making me feel , the whole shabang is more then I can carry EVRYDAY in my heartmindI NEVER understood why she felt that way to me her alledged daughter , why I 'm seen as a loser and disgrace , how she could leave me alone , without alot of basic needs , why she just turned her back on meThink about itwould'nt that weigh on your heartsminds
1	I do n't knowI just know I want to end the misery
1	when i was 7 my dad passed away , that 's when it all kicked off
1	i became very isolated and i was scared to go outsidei am13soon turning 14 and everything seems to be getting worsermy mother started drinking , taking drugs etcshe does nt do it anymore but just thinking about her starting doing it all again makes me scaredI ca n't stay focussed on work in school that s why my grades are pretty bad
1	i used to see the school therapist every two weeks just because i needed to speak to someoneI tried commiting suicide when i was 12 because i could nt cope with it allNow that i m nearly 14 i found better ways of coping with my saddness such as drinkingsmokingI know i sound very badI try not to drink or smoke because i know that it might lead to bad thingsMost people seem to drift away from me because i am a problem like one of my ex bestfriends called me
1	I am very short tempered and irritableIt is very easy to offend me and make me sad
1	Even a thing like oh your make up is a bit smudged offends meI absoloutely hate going outside , i hate reality , i hate people , i hate everything
1	I 'm scared of people , they all seem evil and scary
1	Hormonal fluctuations gave me terrible migraines and weakness and i was getting all sorts of symptoms from low estrogen
1	I had it pre pregnancy all my life but it 's exponentially worse now
1	With the suggestion of my previous endo i tried birth control pills
1	Microgynon 20 fixed migraines but have me daily headaches , joint pain , dryness , and terrible mood swings and back pain I 'm still going to physio
1	My endo did sex hormone tests but I wo n't see her until June and i think I 'm ready to try another birth control pill
1	I would love to hear from someone who takes it continuously for hrt , migraine , endomeyriosis as that 's what i do , but i had to stop the norimin 28 due to anxiety
1	I wonder if i needed a break
1	I 'm sick of this perimenopause business which i feel I 've been having all my life because I 've got hashimoto 's too and i just want my hormones leveled out
1	I feel like I 'm getting unhinged and it 's doing my nut in
1	Today I had to ask my boyfriend to move out because I do n't know how to deal with the changes in him that have been gradually intensifying since February when he started having paranoid trips during smoking pot , then from time to time he 'd become paranoid sober
1	I used to be able to calm him down , but now its almost like he thinks I 'm incompetent for not being paranoid with him , at least when he 's in that mode
1	Anyway , he 's gradually become emotionally and physically abusive , which is a totally different man than who I knew for the first 10 months
1	Abuse is not acceptable , and I already agree with that , hence why once he calmed down I asked him to pack his things
1	Behaviour changes include misanthropy , anger , verbal abuse , and physical abuse , and , though not so much recently paranoia No , I just want to ask people about their triggers , or the triggers of others , and dealing with them
1	What are things you , or people who know sets them off , and have said help ground them , for instance , he told me once smoking helps
1	I 've also done some reading where it mentioned yelling is a trigger , which makes sense in relation to what happened this morning and how something so small escalated so quickly
1	He seems very lost lately , recognize these changes in himself , but goes back and forth as to why they are happening
1	As far as I can tell there 's no talking to him about therapy or meds , so I 'm trying to keep this question simply focused on what I Can talk to him about as his friend rather than girlfriend
1	Thank you for your help
1	Let me explain my situation to you me and my boyfriend do not have sex anymore because of my intense fear of getting pregnant
1	However a few weeks ago I gave him oral sex and he ejaculated
1	About 10 20 minutes later we dry humped grinding my naked vagina on his naked shaft , but not the tip of his penis
1	I have an anxiety disorder so usually the first couple days of school I do not eat at all and I 'm constantly on the edge of a panic attack
1	My period was due 10 days ago , and I 've been having pregnancy symptoms for the past week
1	I took a dollar store pregnancy test just the other day which turned out negative , but god knows how reliable it was coming from the dollar store
1	Before getting married my wife lived with relatives who she always complained about and said they treated her like ht
1	I will agree that they were not always nice , but I also saw that my wife would exaggerate things
1	Maybe cook once a month and only cleans when she knows we are having a house guest
1	She promised me children and now looks for every excuse not to have them
1	She does have an autoimmune disease which does make her tired and her medication makes her not interested in sexso she says
1	I 'm a doer and I do not mind doing these chores on top of working
1	My problem is that she shows no interest in anything but herself
1	I ca n't even have an adult conversation with her because anything she does not like she deflects and turns it into an argument
1	She constantly says that everybody annoys her
1	Says I treat her like crapkeep in mind aside from all I do
1	Itry to spend time with her each dayask her about her day , spend time watching tv withjust try to have an overall interactive life and communicateI can live with all the abovewhat I ca n't live with is the following
1	When we argueshe because irrational and violentshe will verbally abuse meso I walk away , she will follow me and antagonize me til I shout back and when she does nt like what I have to say , she will kick and punch me , knee me in the balls , spit in my face , threaten to stab herself with knives
1	She grabs all my possesions and breaks them
1	Tonight she broke a wallet of mine , the time before a 1,000 watch
1	I 've done laundry and folded and she throws and tantrum and dumps all the dressers on the floor
1	Then says I care nothing about her feelings and what she has to say
1	How about my feeling and just wanting a normal life with a job and a familythat 's all I want
1	I love her so much , but her entire life she lived off her parents and relatives , now me
1	She does not contribute to anything in this relationship and quite frankly I ca n't seeing my divorcing her , because I love her and want her to be better , but If I knew what I was getting in to I would have never married her
1	I am misserable , have gained weight , and just do n't have the same appreciation for things like I used to
1	She thinks people says things they never said
1	She twists things aroundfor example she was being mean and abusive and so I said I really do n't give a   about what you have to sayher responsei knew ityou just finally admitted it , you do n't care about me , you never did , you do n't love me
1	But somehow and some way , I am always to blame , its always my fault and I am selfish and care about nothing but myself
1	Please keep in mind that I am a very honorable and kind person and very likeableplease help me
1	Thank you all for your timeI am greatful
1	So I turn 19 in november and my baby is due jan 30th
1	Him and I were only together for 5 months when I found out I was pregnantive had a couple 2 year relationships I do nt think what I have right now is just a young stupid love its realand he ended up going to bootcamp soon after we found out
1	We moved fastwe just graduated and moved in together at his parents house for awhile before he lefthe feels like the one and we were talking about taking a chance and getting married when he s back from boot so I can go somewhere with different school opportunities and be with him
1	When I found out I was pregnant we decided lets do it before he left
1	Now i m getting bigger and feeling more lonley and scared because he s gone and do I know what i m getting myself into
1	I m working non stop and supper stressed living with my grandparents and being away from him does nt help
1	But I love him and my babyif I stayed circumstances would be worse so i m going through with thisits just hard
1	I posted this question to occupational safety division , but it seems like expert over there is not answering the questions since October
1	Well , I want to seek your advice
1	I am 22 years old
1	It lasted about two hours and I had a headache few hours afterwards
1	In a petcoke production workshop I was inhaling petcoke vapour for about 10 minutes directly by standing in an enclosed space with hot petcoke , and was somewhere around these vapours for about half an hour
1	The accidents described above happened in two different days with a 10 days interval between them
1	Benzene exposure was the last one and I feel absolutely fine after couple of hours , same as after petcoke exposure
1	Since I 'm hypochondriac , the questions that worries me is Do these shortterm activities increase the risk of any type of cancer or chronic blood or lung disease in the future
1	Thank you in advance and kind regards to all of you , George
1	So me and my boyfriend moved into an apartment together
1	I suppose the pastor of the church I used to go to found out
1	He started calling me , telling me the Bible disproves of it   we should either get married or not live with each other
1	Well I was n't going to move out   me and my boyfriend are n't ready to get married
1	So I jus let him say what he needed to say and thought that was the end of it
1	He kept on calling me anyway , my mother said after 3 times he 'd leave me alone because some Bible passage says something like that
1	ANYWAY , i started avoiding his calls and not calling him back
1	HE SHOWED UP AT MY APARTMENT
1	So I 'm forced to have a ' sitdown meeting ' with him becuase I do n't want to be rude and tell him to leave
1	I finally ended up telling him the next time he called that my boyfriend and I were going to figure it out on our own and we appreciate his concern but I 'm not even a member of the church anymore but thanks
1	Well he ends up showing up at my apartment again , this time with my uncle
1	After that I have completely ignored all his calls , even picking up and immediately hanging up on him
1	Just a few minutes ago at 830pm he showed up and asked if he could come in and have a ' quick chat ' with me
1	I told him no because I was busy
1	He then said that he needed another day and time that I 'd be available
1	Becuase I feel that it 'd be rude for me to flat out say Leave me alone
1	I set up a day and time we could talk
1	This situation has stressed me out to the point of tears and I do n't know what else to do to get him to leave me alone
1	I 've told him that I do n't need his help , I 've ignored his calls and voice mails
1	I need someone to tell me how to handle that
1	The First Time I am a young mother of three but my story start with the one that I 'll share to you guys and i really want to ask and very open for suggestions if i need to consult someone in the medical profession regarding this matter
1	When I was pregnant with my first child almost 6years ago because he ’ll turn 6 years old this July I always dreamt every night and talking with someone but I was n't really aware of it since I was asleep but sometimes I felt that I 'm talking when I open my eyes but then I go to sleep again
1	I did n't mind that at all since it was not a big deal to my husband since I was pregnant an excuse I guess but when we happened to go home to my province one time while I was still pregnant with my 1st child my 1st cousin told me that you know our grandmother my father 's mom said that you often talked to her every night for I guess almost 2months in a row ” but we did n't believe her since you 're in the city and we 're here in the province
1	Since , we are in different places so they thought that my grandma is going crazy so they did n't mind what she was telling but husband said maybe it 's true since every night during the time duration that our grandma said that you were talking to her you were really always talking every night
1	But then I did n't mind it that badly since i thought maybe It was just a coincidence
1	I just even cracked a joke that now I ’m communicating in dreams
1	The same time around Just last month , December of 2010 when my sister was planning to go in the province to go process somethings i felt something that drives me to tell her not to take that trip that day going home but i did n't tell her that since i thought maybe she wo n't take that trip because of some things that she might do first but then she took the trip going to the province because they were in another city a 6 hours drive away from the city where we also reside
1	So on that night she took that trip and on the next day after that trip she told me she got traumatized because the bus she rode to was been held up by some men and took all their money , every passenger and the collection of the bus from that trip was robbed
1	I was so regretful that I did n't tell her not to take that trip because I felt something that something bad might happen but ignored it but I still told her that I should have told you and she said too that you should have told me that so that I never got onto that trip
1	Third time Still just last month , I dreamt that my grandpadad of my mom who passed away last year of march that when he died when we I was wiping his face with a cotton he rise up from death and told that he was hungry and thirsty and there was no food and even told some more things but I could n’t remember it all but what I can remember It was the voice of my late grandpa who was talking but the face of the man I was certain that It was n’t him because I was always figuring out so I did n’t mind that much that dream but I told my aunt , my mom , my sis and other members of the family about that dream that it might have a meaning but again it was n’t much of a big deal but after maybe about two2weeks my brother inlawthe bro of my husband suddenly passed away and when I was wiping the hand of my broinlaw with cotton balls to remove some dirt ’s from the remains of the medical scotch tapes I do n’t know the right term for that but by then my dream came through that it was my brotherinlaw whom I was wiping with cotton on the face in my dream that it was n’t my grandpa but my grandpa ’s voice
1	The face in my dream clearedup and it was him , so I thought if I should have seen and known that it was him in my dreams we should have gone with them when he called me that we ’ll have a family get away but I told him that we might not go along with them because my father was still at the hospital at that time but was discharged the next day that the getaway was planned but we did n’t joined in but it was the last day after all that we ’ll talk to him that he ’s alive and maybe the time that he ’ll say goodbye because after 2days he was gone
1	If only I saw him that he was that man from my dream but I did n’t it was later
1	Fourth Instance This year , January 2011 there had been some problems and I need to talk to this person since she hurt me a lot and I was really dying to call her so that we meet up and settle things up but I was thinking twice and very reluctant that she might not answer my call or would hangup on me instead so I left my kids in the play yard place to have things being taken cared and play while you do groceries or shopping
1	When I went down to a bookstore just to kill my time if I could by something while my kids are still enjoying playing I was still deeply thinking to call that person but still reluctant so I just kept looking around to find stuff for me to buy maybe I was an hour there and then suddenly when I look by the side I saw that person that I was dying to call to talked to and settle things up So I approached her right away and told her I was really thinking of calling you since this morning to settle things but I was thinking twice so we talked … But again is this a coincidence
1	Please I need your help on these , please post comments and suggestions
1	Hey guys , So i have been dating this girl for around four months , and recently she informed me of a horrible thing that happened with her father
1	Apparently she came home intoxicated one night , and her father had just decided right there to force her into sex
1	She was unconscious for a while , but woke up telling him to stop
1	Now i could nt find one thing wrong with this girl , she is great
1	I mean she is really a normal girl , does good in school university , and does nt have any problem being involved in sexual stuff with me
1	I feel it was more devastating for me to hear this than for her to tell it
1	She still lives with her father and her family , who does well , and claims that he only did this once not too long ago that is
1	She was honest enough to admit this to me I am only the 2nd person to know besides one of her friends , so i feel that she would be honest enough to tell me that it affects our relationship , and it really does nt seem to bother her anymore
1	It scares the crap out of me when she goes home to her family , because she still lives with this pervert
1	She was not a minor when this happened , so maybe the normal effects of an incest situation did not affect her like it would have normally effected a young minor
1	We are going to talk more about it soon , once I am able to see her in person again tomorrow , but I just need to insight
1	I mean she was still disgusted by the incident , felt very violated , and has a hard time talking about it and does nt get along with him at all , but it really just does nt seem to effect her everyday life like it would effect somebody else
1	I am also very worried that this might happen again , but I do nt know what to do since she has nt told anybody
1	Hello , I am currently a patient of the Albert Road private psychological clinic regarding my mental state
1	I have suffered from anxiety for several years recently to the extent of not leaving the house except for school and so forth
1	My parents say I can become extremely aggressive at times
1	I swear at both my parents and my sister , only after my outbursts   sometimes violent do I feel remorseful
1	Just recently I Have experienced sensations under and in my skin , my hearing has become extremely over sensitive to the point where I cry when people eat around me
1	I have seen my dog several times although he was physically in the room
1	I have also heard male voices calling my name
1	Just days ago I was seeing stars   the sort of stars you see in cartoons floating above me and in the corner of the room
1	I really think there is something wring with me and I am positive that I am dying
1	My eyes will not allow me to focus on one object without jittering around , please give me answers
1	Hi , After pulling an allnighter , I find that I fall asleep quite quickly , however , after roughly 2 hours , I always wake up , drenched in sweat , extremely confused and anxious , and with a fast heart rate
1	I wake up so sweaty that I have to change my blouse , which is completely wet
1	I feel a sense of impending doom associated with something I was working on during the allnighter For example , if during the allnighter I 've worked on a boat design , then I may have the sense of impending doom associated with the irrational idea that the boat is too heavy
1	As I am used to feelings of anxiety , I remain quite calm while this happens   nevertheless , my mind seems to have an impetus of its own , and just continues to associate the sense of impending doom with the irrational idea
1	Also thoughts seem to move without sense around the irrational idea   all the while I understand that this is irrational , and yet my mind still does it
1	Then it fluctuates between 95110 for 3050mins or so before returning to my normal 7585
1	Only thing I noticed that could be abnormal was what is a slightly low QT   around 332 uncorrected , 379 corrected at heart rate 78 , or around 322 uncorrected , at heart rate 96
1	As my heart rate is generally not low enough , especially when I 've done my ECGs , it is unclear whether my QT would prolong sufficiently with a reduction in heart rate
1	Other than these incidents after allnighters , and a blood pressure which is towards the high side generally 14080 , I 've had no problems with my heart
1	My mind keeps racing through what seems to be incoherent thoughts , and I have vivid and absurd dreams regarding those thoughts
1	After the symptoms calm down again , which takes less time the second time around , I again find the same difficulty falling asleep , the same vivid dreams and incoherent thoughts racing through my mind , even though I feel extremely tired
1	So my question is , what causes these symptoms , are they benign , and is it common to experience similar symptoms after an allnighter
1	I am 22 year old , and otherwise perfectly healthy have suffered of anxiety in the past , but nowadays , it rarely troubles me
1	Hi , I just had a baby with a man that i was not marry to nor in a relationship with
1	I know I made a BIG mistake
1	I met him because I work with this guy 's father
1	We took a paternity test because he wanted to be sure I was sure , test came back that is the father
1	He told his family about it all
1	Most people told him that he should did this and could 've did this
1	But when he told his dad , the man that I work with , he said that I TARGETED his son
1	This hurt me soooo bad that I got upset and burst into tears
1	We got into an argument and his son said NOTHING to defend me
1	He does not know how much I did n't want another child   I have 1 daughter Already
1	He said that I asked for his son 's number , he did not ask for mine
1	He said you liked my son , he never said that he liked you
1	Yes , I asked for his son number , but was not planning to have a relationship with him , especially NOt Get preganant
1	I am upset at both of them
1	I am not sure what I should do
1	We work together and he did not attempt to apologize to me I WOULD NOT ACCEPT IT ANYWAY
1	Please someone give me advice and say something to help me through this
1	PS When i told his son that was pregnant at 2 weeks pregnant He did nothing to support me , the whole nine months I had no support from the his son and yet he said nothing to his son about that
1	Hi all , I ve just found out I have BPD and waiting not very paciently for therapy
1	Reading others perspectives on this afliction it really saddens me to know so many others feel the extreme sensitivity and ' over awareness ' that I do
1	My heart goes out to all of you and selfishly I draw relief from knowing I m not the only one
1	Can anyone advise me on my situation does anyone else experience similar to this I m totally inconsistant I m an artist yet find it so hard to conclude a painting
1	I change my mind I m obsessive or indifferent , compulsiveits almost impossible to complete an idea
1	The sad thing is I ve had shows and won a couple of awards , I have a Masters degree and trained at the RCA and next year I ve got more shows lined up with a gallery interested and I still feel worthless and petrified
1	I feel I might kill myself trying to produce the work
1	I have 2 children from previous relationships , and i recently got remarried to a wonderful man who has 2 children of his own
1	From the age of 3 I have endured plenty of horrible things in my life such as sexual molestation , rape , domestic abuse , gang violence , and an emergency hysterectomy at the age of 25
1	I am currently taking medication for bipolar and anxiety , and I have an amazing counselor that I meet with regularly
1	My parents , my brother , and my now husband are the greatest
1	They have been there for me through all of my
1	Whenever I find myself alone with my thoughts , all I can think about is how my husband is cheating on me every chance he can get , my kids would be happier if they lived with my parents , and how it would be so easy to swallow a bottle of pills and end all this mental anguish
1	I tend to think my husband is lying to me constantly , and I find myself trying to pick fights with him
1	I think everything that goes wrong in someone else 's life is some how my fault , and i constantly have feelings of guilt for no reason
1	But the minute my kids come home , or my husband comes home , or i go to my parents , i feel like i am on top of the world
1	I do not want to lose my husband
1	I try very hard to control my snide comments and my attitude because I do understand that my thinking and behavior is not rational most of the time
1	I feel like i am losing my mind
1	I do nt want to get to the point where i have hurt everyone i love and pushed them awaybecause i can see myself doing it already
1	I do n't know what to expect but I 'm tired of being haunted by what I did in the past
1	To give a backstory I had a troubled childhood this is no excuse for my actions
1	My father was physically and emotionally abusive to my mother and older siblings , and left her for his secretary , taking the house and leaving my mother penniless when she was near death
1	I was probably about 7 at the time , and my only vivid memories of my life before I was 10 are of the horrible moment my mother was taken to hospital possibly the last time I would see her alive luckily she survived
1	I hated my father from that moment , and my childhoodearly teenage years were truly miserable with my mother turning to drink to cope
1	I was sexually abused by a school bully from about age 9
1	Our mothers were close friends and he was much bigger and stronger than me
1	He used to make me play games and touch him in his genitals , overpowering me if I refused
1	I hate to say this , but in my weakness and misery I took it out on my sister who was 4 years younger   treating her badly , and even mimicked one of the games I was subjected to on a couple of occasions when I was 910
1	At 14 I was verbally abusive to my family members , doing terrible at school , and had been using hardcore porn for sexual gratification for years at this point
1	That summer I did n't socialise with anyone and rarely left my bedroom
1	I became nocturnal , sleeping through the day
1	On two or three occassions I remember pleasuring myself in my sibling 's room while she was sleeping
1	I did not touch her in any inappropriate places , and I will be quite honest I did not even feel guilty until about 2 years later when I suddenly remembered these awful things I 'd done and felt absolutely devastated with myself for my actions
1	I am not excusing my behaviour   trust me everyday it is like having a cloud in my mind , with a millstone pressing down against my brain
1	I get no solice and no matter what good things I do nowerdays my subconscious tells me I am evil and do n't deserve to be happy
1	My sister and I have a fantastic relationship , and she is always excited when I go to visit and textsemails often
1	I have a great relationship with the rest of my family , and got myself a good education , a good job , and always make an effort to treat people well
1	I lost my faith in God because I could not forgive myself for my actions , ended up having a drinking problem and turning to drugs because of my guilt , but everytime I sort my life out I feel this awful guilt
1	It 's like my subconscious will not allow me to be happy maybe I do n't deserve to be
1	Like I said I do n't know what I want from this
1	I 've just got to a point where I need to get this out of my head and perhaps even rationalise the things I 've done in my life
1	I 'm an OCD cleaner among other things , but cleaning plays the most prominent role
1	My vacuum died and I went into an extreme , deep depression
1	I did n't know what to do with myself   I felt lost
1	For example , my paternal aunt is dying from Lou Gherig 's disease
1	I 'm sad and all , but I ca n't fathom what it 's like for her daughters , husband , mother , or sister and my dad
1	They remain   stoic I suppose is the nicest way to put it
1	I 'm dealing with long term goals , multiple mental illnesses , physical stuff , age 23 stuff , deep seeded issues I was never allowed to deal with , so here I am   23 years later trying to catch up on what 's going on now but also trying to maintain my sanity of what has happened in the past
1	I 'm SOOOO tired of always having things like this dumped on me
1	I 'm breaking out because of my period , and then I get an ulcer in my mouth , then I get a yeast infection , or some other physical ailment
1	And what 's ironic about it is that none of this stuff happened to me when I was young and naive
1	They started when someone told me about their own experience
1	I got a turntable for my birthday , back in February
1	Since then , it has just been sitting around until Radio Shack had a sale and I got a receiver
1	The speakers were difficult and confusing , but NOW , my turntable wo n't even turn on
1	I go completely blank if I do n't squeeze in what is in my head
1	It 's not just verbal or written   I have left things in my microwave for a long time and I try to estimate how long it has been
1	I go into a state of catatonia and I wake up not knowing where I am , what I 'm doing , how long I 've been doing it , etc
1	I told my friend I need a live in nurse
1	And he thought I was joking , but I am totally serious
1	Vision   it 's going and they do n't know why
1	A lot of what stresses me out is the speed on my life
1	I 'm going blind but the optometrist , ophthalmologist , neurologist   they 've confirmed that everything is healthy but they ca n't figure out why my vision is rapidly decreasing
1	Basically , I 'm as healthy as I can be , but I have these symptoms that are unfathomable
1	I do n't know what to do about it because it 's frustrating hearing , I 'm sorry   blah , blah , blah or even bothering with trying to search for an answer
1	I do n't even think I can get into it
1	If anyone wants to join my whining party , send me a message
1	Hi , i am a 38 yr old female and over the last 18 months have been experiencing pelvic type pain which comes and goes without warning
1	When it occurs i feel like i need to pass urine but when i go to the toilet there is hardly any flow of urine
1	Over the last 6 months i have also been experiencing pain to the right side of my back near the area of my kidneys which also can be disabling , but this also comes and goes without warning
1	Both the pelvic and back pain normally do nt coincide with one anotherHowever i normally feel like i want to pass urine and that my bladder is full six years ago i had abnormal smear tests which showed mild dyskariosis
1	I was treated for this over 4 years as my smear tests kept coming back abnormal
1	For the last 2 years they have come back clear
1	However i also get bleeding in between my periods which feel like an actual period
1	For instance i came off a period 5 days ago and have restarted bleeding again My periods are also quite disabling and i feel fatigued all the time and moody
1	My mother had a full hysterectomy and removal of her ovaries when she was in her late 20 's for ovarian cancer
1	I m not sure whether i could be premenopausal or whether i need to be concerned about something else
1	I have been to m GP in relation to the back pain on which she thought was musculoskeletal
1	I work in the medical field yet I have been blind to my own symptoms
1	I am 47 and on Mircette for birth control and as a prophylactic for migraines   so I do not have a period
1	For the past three months or so I have been waking at 3 am despite 100 mg Trazadone that had been working fairly for several years soaked in sweat
1	Anyway , I attributed this to stress and a worsening of my Anxiety NOS
1	I 'm currently on 75 mg of Effexor which a PA gives me and does n't ask any questions
1	I was on 150 mg and I think that worked better but I asked for it to be decreased because Effexor is n't the best drug to be on
1	Boy I keep ranting   sorry but I 'm excited that I may have stumbled on the cause of my constant , nagging , almost disabling anxiety of late
1	The other day it finally dawned on me   maybe I 'm in peri or real menopause
1	Maybe that 's why I wake early drenched in sweat   and maybe that 's why my anxiety has taken a turn for the worse
1	Yesterday I went to the drugstore and the pharmacist suggested Remifemin
1	I was concerned about drug interactions   I 'm on Synthroid , ' Effexor and Mircette
1	She said if I started on a higher dose of Black Kohesh sp
1	I 'm excited cause I can see hope and an end to this uncomfortable anxiety
1	Before I start let me just say that I 'm going to the doctor as soon as possible for examination
1	I am just scared and stressed out of my mind and I want some idea of what 's going on
1	six weeks ago I started feeling onoff minor pain in my pelvis , usually on the left but sometimes in the right or center
1	The nausea worsens when I strain my eyes , when I 'm thirsty , and occasionally in the mornings
1	I 've had a couple of days with just constant abdominal pain that radiates up through my rib cage
1	I just assumed this was all due to an STD , cyst , endometriosis , or something like that
1	However , three days ago I noticed my right supraclavicular lymph node was swollen just from feeling around on my neck due to boredom
1	I almost feel like I 'm imagining feeling a couple others as well , but I 'm not entirely sure about that how many clavicular nodes are there
1	Also around the same time I noticed the node my legs and arms began feeling tingly and weak
1	It worsens in my handsarms when I make a fist
1	This is n't all the time and it seems to get worse when I think about it or when I stand for long periods of time
1	I felt weaker than usual when doing leg workouts in the weight room earlier today
1	I know the only way to know is by getting examined but I am in tears with fear
1	I 'm a 15 year old female with no history of medical problems
1	I know a lot of people in my family have been diagnosed with cancer , including my brother when he was two , but I have no idea if that is of importance
1	Is this just me being a hypochondriac and thinking I 'm a doctor because I type all of my symptoms into google too frequently
1	My wife and I have been married for 25 years , high school sweet hearts
1	Turns out this is the result of years of her feeling the negativity from my depression and self esteem issues
1	It 's not what I was thinking , that she was seeing somebody else
1	I was trying to cut the cable to release where we could lower it , and I was telling her to hold her side up a little higher so I could get it released
1	I know I was talking forcefully and with urgency in my voice
1	She said stop yelling at me in trying
1	This is where the vision of her with somebody else , and us never really ever having a real fight off any kind in our 25 years together
1	All I could think and said was I 'm not yelling at you , THIS is yelling
1	This shook her to her core
1	I never cane at her , or touched her violently
1	I would never do that , I love her deeply
1	I 've always been strongly against violence toward women , something she loved me for
1	She said she does n't feel safe now
1	Did n't know if she loves me
1	This has been 3 weeks of the worst hell I 've ever felt
1	I 'm seeing a therapist , and I 've asked that she come with me
1	Just last night , after 3 weeks , she finally told me what has scared her
1	I apologized that night for yelling , she nodded
1	I had no idea she was hurt so badly by my outburst
1	I never had any intention of violence , I knew exactly what I was doing
1	I was screaming out in protest because I thought she was cheating
1	She was never in any danger from me
1	So how can I get her to see that the person she fell in love with is still right here
1	She does n't have to be afraid that if I lose my temper , that I could be like that again
1	I have another therapy session tomorrow , and after management is on the agenda
1	But her being scared is not something I can fix
1	I also had a baby girl September 2014
1	I remember feeling like I did n't have any help with caring for my daughter
1	My husband took almost a week to even hold her for more than five minutes
1	So I guess that 's when I started feeling a little overwhelmed
1	Then in January I lost my mother my only living parent , the only parent I knew
1	My job was taking care of her so I lost that when I lost her
1	If I could stay in bed each day , all day long , I would
1	The night my mom passed runs through my head all the time
1	I still see her laying on the ground after emt 's tried saving her
1	Her passing is the hardest thing I 've ever been through
1	I 'm so thankful I have my daughter because without her I do n't know where I 'd be
1	I know she needs me to grow up
1	My husband and I have been married for two years but now things are going downhill
1	We 've been separated for the last month but still live together
1	I 've told him about feeling depressed but he does n't seem to care or help me
1	In March I 've called our towns outpatient psychiatric clinic to see about getting help for depression but they never return my calls
1	I do n't know if I should talk to my primary care doctor about feeling depressed
1	I do n't know if there is anything she could do for me
1	Divorce , husband friend of 13 years before marriage    he was never happy with me
1	Still ca n't figure out why he wanted to marry me since I was n't good enough
1	Worst part , he was my best friend for 13 YEARS before we got married but , I accepted it , and gave him what he wanted
1	2008   THATS when he wanted the divorce after my FIRST of many layoffs
1	She took me to a bar where there was a band playing
1	She was trying to get me out of the house to have fun
1	I 'm divorcing him
1	He 's a con man free loader who is 47 years old dreaming of being a rock god rather than GET A JOB to help pay bills
1	My hemo oncologist has put me thru every test to find a cause of my elevated eosinophils   a type of white blood cell
1	she did a CBC , it came back abnormal
1	Meaning my red blood cells were n't processing the iron from my diet
1	And it BARELY got me over the hump in the numbers
1	And mine are not    So hemo doc mentions the BB word
1	My husband and I have been married for 10yrs , 20 yrs all together , teenage loves
1	Last year in May I found out that he is talking to a female from a dating website
1	I confronted my husband about it but he refused to stop talking to her bc she is his friend
1	We have been fighting about this for 8 months , I have allowed this to go on , he takes her out on dates every Friday night
1	He wants to be in an open marriage with me and I refuse so in my mind he is openly cheating on me
1	He calls her his girlfriend now and tells me I need to respect his girlfriend and their relationship
1	fast forward to this month , on Jan 1st of this year he texts me and asked how I would feel if he wanted to go and spend a few nights a week with her at her home
1	Things have gotten worse , so now I have rented a townhome for myself and I 'm separating myself from the situation
1	Should I feel guilty for leaving him
1	Bc he now is saying I 'm walking out on our marriage
1	When I first exp depression my onc put me on Remeron as I had lost a lot of weight with chemo
1	It made me feel better quit quickly but piled on the weight my norm is 112
1	So when I was at 130 I said please something else
1	Long story short I have tried Effexor , celexa , lexapro these had me suicidal within 3d
1	I was much much worse than I had ever been
1	She ref me to a psych
1	He tried nortriptyline but I could nt tol the side effects
1	I 'm back on remeron   basically not eating so I do n't gain weight it 's torture
1	Every time I get of remeron I easily go back to my baseline so I 've ruled out tamoxifen
1	My PD said we could try serzone
1	My last period ended on the 6th of June , which was by far the most stressful month I 've ever encountered
1	On the 20th of June , I gave oral and swallowed , but cleaned up and my clothes remained on so there was no semen in or around my vagina
1	I DID get my period , or what seems to look like it
1	When I first had it this morning , there was a small amount of blood
1	Over the past few days , my breasts have grown
1	One day when I squeezed , there was a bit of a clear discharge
1	I noticed today that my mouth had an odd taste to it
1	Since I am a virgin and pregnancy can not be the answer considering that there has never been a penis in me , what could be wrong
1	Could I be overthinking my symptoms and convincing my body
1	My Mother is 78 years old suffering from depression , dementia , failure to thrive since losing her husband two years ago
1	She had colon cancer in 1995 and they removed a foot of her colon and surrounding lymph nodes without any other cancer treatment needed
1	She had a follow up colonoscopy in August 2001 and this is the only one she has had
1	She is refusing any diagnostic testing including labs as she has stated she is just wanting to die naturally
1	She has had chronic diarrhea for two and one half years and is now resulting in fecal incontinence
1	She has always suffered from low sodium levels and unfortunately her MD has been prescribing long term use and dosages that are too high on the medications Ambien which she has taken 13 yrs
1	20 mg hs , Valium 5 mg 20 mg daily and she takes Phenobarbital 90 mg daily for epilepsy
1	She is now suffering diarrhea resulting in complete incontinence at least 6 times daily
1	She refuses to tell the MD about her diarrhea and symptoms and will not allow me to come with her for her MD visits
1	I am handling being her caregiver alone as the rest of my family refuses to help
1	In November I ended up in the ER with heart palpitations
1	After various tests , they could n't find anything wrong and said I 'm fine
1	I 'm 36 with no previous health conditions
1	I saw a cardiologist in December and he said the palpitations are premature beats that everyone has and it 's benign
1	I still have heart palpitations daily
1	I 'm getting a second opinion next week because I felt the first cardiologist brushed me off and the palpitations are bothersome to me
1	About 3 weeks after being in the ER I developed headaches
1	I basically had a headache every day from about Mid December through the end of February
1	I was convinced I had a brain tumor and saw a neurologist
1	I was full of anxiety and crying on my husband 's shoulder every night
1	The neurologist diagnosed me with tension headaches and sent me for physical therapy
1	I had a few weeks in March where I barely had any headaches but now they 're back and I 'm a mess
1	I burst into tears over the littlest things throughout the day
1	I do n't want to leave my house
1	The thought of going to work fills me with dread and I cry as I 'm driving there every morning
1	I 've used up all my sick days already
1	I 'm getting all sorts of little pinchy pains all over my body and I 'm certain there 's something wrong with me
1	I saw a psychiatrist for the first time ever last week and she prescribed a low dose of klonopin 1x a day and xanax as needed I actually have been using xanax for a few weeks already , prescribed by my primary doctor
1	I feel like I 'm having a major depressive episode on top of anxiety
1	This is so unlike me and I 'm scared and tired of feeling this way
1	I will see the psychiatrist again next week , so I can bring it up with her then
1	I was prescribed Remeron for help with weight gain and anxiety
1	I gained plenty of weight with this medicine , but have n't felt like it does any good with my anxiety or depression
1	Prior to starting Remeron , I had NO trouble falling asleep without any assistance
1	When I tried stopping Remeron after taking 75 mgnight , it was fine for a few days but after that I had the most terrible time sleeping
1	I would lay there awake , but not really functioning , for 6 hours at night
1	As if this is n't frustrating enough , I went to a different doc for a second opinion , and he said Remeron is just for sleep , not even depression or anxiety
1	I told him about the insomnia issue , and he said it should n't have anything to do with stopping the Remeron , since it is NONHABIT FORMING
1	I find this very questionable since I had no trouble sleeping prior to this medicine
1	I feel like ever since starting Remeron , things have been very unstable
1	Now I ca n't tell if it 's the medicine , or just me
1	I do n't want to be on medicine longterm but now I feel like if I stop , the withdrawal will make it too difficult to function
1	Through reading other posts , I 've seen a few members saying that they do n't believe in recovered memories
1	I 'm curous to know what someone mat mean by that Is it that you do n't believe that children suffering a traumatic event have the ability to block it out or is it that you just do n't believe they can be recalled from that amnesialike state
1	I 'm just curious since everyone that I 've seen as a client has thought I 've blocked out childhood trauma but that it 's still not completely buried as I have vivid nighterrors they now diagnosed as flashbacks and PTSD
1	On one level I 've always known but was so afraid of what happened and who could have traumatized me that I spent even more time in the past 5 years denying it and trying to bury it
1	I remember nothing past the age of 67 and the two memories I do have I could n't say if they really were at age 7 instead of 9
1	So that 's why I 'm interested to know what people believe about blocked trauma , amnesia or supressed memories and how they feel about whether someone can recall memories to someanyextent or whether someone believes that if you ca n't recall the actual memories than more than likely nothing happende dto begin with
1	My problem started about five or six years ago
1	At first I would only feel extreme mood swings ranging from suicidal thoughts with no action because I 'm too cowardly and selfish to do something like that , to not having a care in the world like everything is perfect
1	Recently I have been noticing that my problem has gotten much worse
1	I have been with my boyfriend for two years now , and we recently moved from Florida where I grew up and lived in a small town for all of my 26 years until about 6 months ago to Colorado
1	My boyfriend noticed my problem in Florida , but I tried to hide it so we could go on with our normal lives
1	Since the move , he and a friend I have who lives here too from Florida often mentions changes he has noticed in me
1	They are very uncontrollable and I feel so badly when I am in a bad mood with him and also I ca n't deal with these horrible feelings anymoreI feel so lost and alone , even when I am not at all
1	Now I always feel like I 'm not pretty enough , I am useless on this earth and wasting space
1	I ca n't even type well right now because typing this fills my eyes with tears
1	I just want to be me again
1	I like to think that I am a smart and reasonable person for the most part and can not over come this for some reason
1	I really do n't know what to do , it does n't go away   I know I wrote a lot but I really need advice
1	My husband and I have been married for 4 12 yrs
1	I have no biological children , and his children are grown
1	About 2 years into the relationship , I noticed that he started showing signs of aggression breaking cell phones , vacuum cleaners , making verbal threats
1	However , now he gets angry if I try to talk to him or ask for help
1	I have no one other than him for emotional support
1	Last night , I had an unusually stressful week and tried to talk to him about what had happened
1	He snapped , Ca n't you see I 'm watching TV right now
1	He constanly cuts me off in mid sentence and tells me to stop bitching
1	Also , lately when we argue , he says things like , I hate you , No wonder no one can stay with youyou probably ran them off , I have other women who want meI do n't have to put up with this , I have never loved you
1	He never apologizes when he says these things
1	The next day he will say , Well are you going to keep it going and   all day today
1	I love him , but I am at my wit 's end
1	I do n't know how much more emotional abuse , yelling and anger I can take
1	I have health problems and work about 32 hrs wkly , plus I attend college fulltime online courses
1	I have no insurance if he leaves me , and I ca n't financially make enough money to pay all the bills
1	He tells me frequently , You do n't want to workthere 's nothing wrong with youit 's all in your head and I make the money around here
1	I am under the care of a rheumatologist for fibromyalgia , and this stress is compromising my health
1	I do n't think I can take much more without having a mental breakdown
1	I have been trying to get my wife into treatment and I keep running into roadblocks that makes it difficult for caring family from helping a family member with BPD get help
1	Of course the biggest obstical is the BP does not belive they need help and any discussion of this topic only causes them to lash out , but all the programs require me to get her permission to talk to me or even to make an appointment for her
1	She is aware that she has this condition but after six monthes in a DBT program almost three years ago they had a graduation party for the group so she believe she has learned all she needed and because of a small mistake of mine taken out of context and overblown she concludes it must not have done any good if I am going do what I did
1	I got her into the program last time by just making an appointment at a DBT clinic and just telling her it 's her choice to go or not and I will go with her to the evaluation but then she would have to continue under her own steam
1	I backed off completely not even asking about it and crossed my fingers
1	She started to become a different person until I did somthing she thought was a major betrayal then it all became worse after that
1	Anyway this clinic and others wo n't allow me to get the ball rolling for her the intake nurses seemed to be hair trigger about medical privacy rules and seem to be anoied and offended that I would even call to help get her into the program
1	You would think that if they work with people with this condition they would try to understand what it is I 'm trying to fo for her and help
1	More importantly how do I approch my wife about getting started with DBT
1	How can I encourage her to go back into the program
1	These lumps developed in my neck over 18 years ago after a very serious medical problems i died 2 's
1	For many of the last 18 years I have seen Dr after Dr for these lumps and I was always told nothing to worry about
1	The last couple of years they developed hard lumps in each side
1	They interfere with ROM of my head and neck
1	They swell so badly sometimes that i can barely breathe
1	Pills and foods get stuck in my throat for hours sometimes
1	I have even had my throat stretched to help this problem to no avail
1	I ca nt lift my arms above my head
1	How do I find a Dr that is willing to do more than just manipulate them and tell me there is nothing to worry about
1	When they first began they were rubbery and ached allot , now the last 23 years they developed this lumps inside
1	The Dr 's see me wince , flinch , pull away from the pain when they are examining them but , yet they do nt LISTEN
1	I have been called a mystery , and an ignigma so many times i hope I never hear that word again
1	I lost my insurance in Jan 07 after carrying it for 20 years
1	It was either keep the insurance or save our home of 20 years
1	We chose our home
1	Is there a test i can buy online that will give me some insigtht into these things
1	I have tried for 18 years to have these things taken care of and everyone keeps passing the buck
1	Almost every day my daughter is sent to student support
1	She even will bite her self
1	she has made threats that she will hurt her self and others
1	She hurts her younger brother , pushed him down the stairs before , and threw our dog down the stairs as well
1	I have thought of admitting her to sphyciatric hospital but not sure if that is the right decision
1	She has been diagnosed with adhd and we have nt had her on meds for it
1	today she even had an accident in her pants while screaming in student support
1	She is in a special school now cause her other school basically had her removed with my permission of course
1	I just was wondering if you had any suggestions
1	Hi , i just joined the site not too sure what its all about , but i have a sneaking suspicion that somethings not qquite right with my mental state its been gradually getting worse since i was around 15 , i m having extreme trouble concentrating in collage its like my mind will just go blank in the middle of a thought and it wo nt come back until like 5 whole seconds afterwardand bear in mind this happens everytime i try to think about something , be it hard or blindingly easy also i tend to get confused quite alot too , which is annoying because ill seem so slow when i m actually reasonably intellegent its even got to the poin where if my mum asks me if i m hungry , i wo nt be able to figure it out until my stomache rumbles
1	i do nt really have any friends anymore because apparently i m not who i used to be anymore i do nt know what that means exactly but they said something like where s your emotion
1	and why do nt you talk as much anymore oddly enough that suits me just fine , cosi do nt enjoy half the stuff i used to like going bowling or going to the ginema just seems like a drag more than anything else and i prefer to be all alone and i d love a solitary existance , where i did nt have to talk to anyone and i could just be left alone to do whatever i needed to without being interupted or feeling like i m being watchedtalked about
1	even my family is starting to tell me that i m too withdrawn or too secretive and i should go out more and socialise and all this other bullst that perents say wish they d just dissappear and leave me be so yeah that s pretty much it any advice whatsoever will do me fine
1	thanks , and sorry if i rambled i tend to be a bit too wordy when writing long things Arklai
1	I realize that sometimes , to move onward , one must literally take one day at a time , one step at a time , one moment at a time , one breath at a time
1	I saw and felt something so genuine last night that I so desperately want to share
1	Last night I stepped out to take a long walk because I felt so rejected and sad
1	So , I had to get it out of my system and went out for a walkrun alone
1	I prayed , sang and meditated mental medication about all the things God blessed me with
1	As I walked back home , I still felt alone
1	Looking down as I usually do , I saw the most beautiful thing
1	And , as I walked pass the wet grass , the soft white light of the lamp post lit the little dew droplets and illuminated them to glistened as though I was walking through a pathway filled with little white diamonds
1	I had to stop to take a second look because it took me by surprise – it was so becoming and so beautiful
1	In my fascination , I heard a soft voice say – “ for you – just because I love you ”
1	Instantly , my heart received this gift and responded with a soft delicate smile saying inside , “ Thank you Lord , I love you too ” And the night ended with me alone …
1	So , Yes   there is joy in the shadows if you will open your eyes to find the silver lining
1	At the end of 2014 my mom made a couple friends
1	Shed always talk about them to me and I was always very proud of her for finally having new friends because ever since my family moved states back in 2009 she had n't left the house
1	So in 2014 she came to me for advice about if I think it 's okay for her to meet her new friends in person
1	ofcourse I encouraged her
1	Well she finally did that weekend and she told me all of these fun stories about her and her friend Stacey , michelle and this gay guy names Stan
1	I was happy for her and so was my dad
1	All through 2015 my mom would go and visit her best friends every single weekend
1	She even went out of state with them and told me crazy stories
1	No matter how crazy they sounded I believed her 100 because that 's how much I trust her
1	My dad asked me a few times if she was cheating on him and i thought he was insane for even thinking that
1	Soon enough my mom told me that she found a guy that she liked and that she does n't want to be with my dad anymore
1	She said that as it turns , the gay guy in her group of friends is n't gay and that he might have a little crush on her too
1	I was kinda shocked but I then tried to tell her that she should n't drag my dad along if you do n't love him anymore then you should tell him
1	She said that I was right
1	My dad spent new years alone and I tried making him feel better by playing bingo , chess , and other board games with him
1	I wondered why my mom would rather spend new years with her friends and not us
1	She did the same on her birthday
1	In the 3RD week of January my mom and dad said they were getting a divorce
1	I tried to act surprised but I just knew it was coming
1	On my 18th birthday i was nt able to spend the day with my dad because my mom wanted me to spend the day with her and her crush
1	This is the day i found out everything my mom and stan were going on one year of dating and her other friends did nt exist
1	I believed every single irrational word that came out of her mouth about her fake friends
1	I felt like crying but i just could nt
1	She then sent me and my sister home so she can finish her weekend with you boyfriend
1	I could nt look at my dad when i got home
1	I just went up to my room and sat there thinking about everything
1	A couple months later my mom made my dad move to the state we used to live in
1	And Then a couple months after that she told me that her and stan are being forced to move to florida
1	That he got fired and he got a job offer in florida she said she does nt want to move there but she had no choice
1	Plus his twin brother lived there so it worked out perfectly had my dad move to the state we used to live in she and her boyfriend moved to Florida and are living happily
1	to this day my dad does n't know about my moms bf and i m just trying to stay afloat since I 'm still in college
1	My mom does n't call me much anymore and I recently found out that my mom and her boyfriend were planning this out months before he even got fired
1	My mom and i are no where near as close as we used to be
1	She 's changed a lot or maybe it 's me
1	I do nt know why I do that
1	For example I had this professor and she was so sweet and kind to me and I always tried to impress her or look for her approval
1	I do nt know why I feel like that
1	I ca n't go to therapy I ca n't afford it either
1	My girlfriend broke up with me over a year and a half ago and I 'm just as crushed as I was the day she did
1	I put her through so much
1	She saw me go from uncontrollable rage to pathetic crying spells
1	There were times that I would n't have sex with her or even touch her then I could n't keep my hands off her
1	I would laugh and play with her son one second then I 'd scream at him for even touching me
1	I put her through the BPD crash course for sure
1	The day she dumped me she said I really deeded to get help so I promised her I would
1	The truth is the main reason that I 'm getting help is because I did n't want to break my last promise to her
1	She 'll never know and I 'll never see her again but I still want to get better because I promised I would try
1	She probably cringes at the thought of me and I do n't blame her at all
1	I have nothing bad to say about her
1	I go back and fourth with almost everyone else in my life but , not her
1	I was In bed with a girl and just could n't do it because I kept thinking of my ex girlfriend
1	I keep screwing up every chance with another girl because I always think of her
1	Is this just my mental problems causing me to feel an emotion that 's not really there
1	Or do I deeply love someone that I drove away and I 'll never see again
1	I 'm a 16 year old female who has been diagnosed with depression , anxiety , and ADD
1	My younger sister ignores me and is very rude , although she could just be entering that moody stage that all kids go through
1	My parents keep stressing about finances , and not too long ago I was told that I would have to pay for my dental bill and classes
1	I understand that I need to take responsibility , but this debt on top of stressful school finals and projects is n't helping at all
1	I need to find jobs , pass my driver 's exam , study for finals , do homework , practice driving , attend 10 hour long school days , spend my sundays doing chores , and now find a way to make over 1,000
1	I cancelled my bithday plans so I would n't stress my parents even more , even though I 'm the one who 's stressed out now
1	In the past couple of days , I have n't felt like eating , sleeping , or doing anything for that matter
1	I have n't gotten sleep in over 24 hours , and can barely even eat a granola bar
1	I ca n't focus on my work and keep thinking depressive thoughts , even when I 'm taking my medication every day
1	I 've contemplated suicide before , but only until now have I seriously considered it as a backup plan to failing
1	I broke down crying in the middle of class today for the first time in my life
1	This is kind of long but I m a make it brief , I ve been molested , raped , my ex use to slapped me , had 2 kids by two different men cause they were both no good , in between them tried dating other men but all they wanted was sex and not a relationship , and I was n't ready for kids but took on my responsibilities and provided food , shelter , and clothes for them both , finished high school with honors and college , right when I finished college I thought everything was starting to fall in place I was in another bad relationship that was off and on for 3 years , I knew he was cheating but I did n't want to continue to be alone , but look at me now I got what I deserved one night of passion do cause a lifetime of pain , he ended up leaving me and my kids for 6 months to go stay with another woman , in that time I figured I should make plans to get with someone else since he was n't coming back but I made the worst mistake ever I got careless and contracted 3 std 's between the both of them 2 were curable but one was n't , and it was HSV1   HSV2 , its been since April and I still have n't gotten over it and do n't know if I will , I m spiraling out of control everything makes me upset and I m angry and want to scream and have n't been able to sleep correctly for years , I hollering at the kids throwing and busting up stuff hitting myself telling myself I m ugly when people clam i m gorgeous , i m pretty , but I do n't see that , I have n't been able to love myself and i m trying to get counseling cause I do n't want to hurt myself or others
1	I just want to kill the both of them but I ca nt go to jail nor be away from my kids , I ve been going to church and praying but I just do n't know what to do anymore , Somebody please I m begging ya Help Me Get Back on Track , I do n't want to lose everything
1	It 's been almost 23 years since I 've been on antidepressants or any kind of medication for my mental health
1	I have only ever tried the one brand of antidepressants I was first put on back then
1	Living with my parents at the time , they began to notice what the medication was doing to me , and realized I was experiencing just about every single symptom labeled contact your doctor immediately if you have type of symptoms
1	My parents actually contacted the psychiatrist I was seeing at the time , as I had no idea anything was even going on , most of the time I was numb , but when I felt anything , it was bad
1	The psychiatrist only upped the dose on me of the same medication brand I was on , and left it at that
1	I ended up taking it upon myself , as I began to hit the spiraling severe depression again one week , I quit the medication cold turkey which I understood was bad for your health to do , and I did experience awful withdrawal symptoms but it made me feel more human being off the meds
1	Well , I have n't been on anything since as I 've been afraid to try anything again
1	I have this awful thought in my head that these medications do n't allow me to be myself , and I do n't want to be numb just to be more manageable to be around for others
1	I 'm not sure what to do to get the help I know that I need , as I ruin any and every type of relationship I have friends , family , romantic , etc
1	I really want help , but I 've noticed which I have tried seeing therapistspsychologists more recently than the last time I took medications I can not seem to find a therapist that suits me
1	The last one I had practically only wanted to talk about themselves , and they and my family made it more about family counseling , which I do not need at this stage , I firmly believe I need to delve into and treat MY problems first before I can assess and treat the problems I have within my relationship with my family
1	My problems cause majority of the problems I have with them , and no offense , but I feel that a lot of my mental problems are genetic , and my parents do n't exactly help anything , as all we ever do is argue , and they are not understanding nor do they calmly listen to anything I try to come to them about
1	The therapist I had prior to that one was the type that when I would discuss how I felt , and my actions they would just put their hand up to interrupt me , and basically tell me not to think like that , or act like that
1	I 'm tired of my narcissistic view of the world , and I 'd really like to get my mental health taken care of as I 'm going to be having a baby at some point within the next month and a half and I 'd like to get on something safe during pregnancy that will also help and prevent my symptoms from worsening with postpartum depression as I 've been told I 'm a good candidate for
1	I have been living with my wife for 12 years
1	She was very sweet and wanted to make me as happy as possible At the slightest disagreement , she would rage or cry or hurt herself Then she would not talk with me for days or even weeks
1	She would falsely accuse me of things that I did not do and would campaign against me to friends and family
1	At the end it would always be that I am insensitive and she loves me so much that she can not live without me
1	I discovered a defense systems where we both separated things as much as possible and avoided disagreements but we set us apart so much that she started to have affair most of them were unknown to me
1	Long time back a therapist told us about BPD and how it may be causing problem in our marraige
1	Her previous affairs were with nice people and somehow got unnoticed from me
1	She is having an affair with a pyshopath She worships the psychopath
1	She does whatever the psychopath wants her to do
1	If psychopath humiliates her with a bad wordshe would repeat that word at another time to humiliate her
1	They are denying everything and campaigning against me as much as possible
1	I am afraid about my 8 year old daughter this psychopath 's sexual craving and variety does not know any age limit
1	He goes with someone as old as his mother 's age to very younger girls
1	I heard so many abnormal sexual things about him many of them from ny wife
1	I have no proofs of my wife 's abuse , suicidal attempts , affairs , how she ignored my daughter the most of last 8 years
1	I donot know how to protect my daughter
1	I do nt even know whether her therapist diagnosed her BPD , because she knows about the disease and the symptoms and the psychopath is directing her on how to fool the therapist
1	I apologise if none of this makes sense , it does n't even make sense in my head so I 'm just going to type as I think and hope that you understand
1	I have been with my partner for 18 months now , and we have a beautiful baby boy
1	He has always been very caring and loving , and treats me like a princess
1	However , a couple of months back I received an email from one of his ex partners saying that he was very controlling throughout their relationship , he apparently cut her off from her friends and family and would often become violent if they had an argument
1	I have also heard that one of the reasons he and his most recent ex split was because he would phone her up when she was out and demand to know when she would be home
1	Since receiving this email I have been very conscious of any signs that he may be doing this to me and a couple of things are starting to bug me a little , but I 'm not sure if I 'm just being silly or not
1	Since the beginning of our relationship , he has openly admitted that he can be quite a jealous person
1	He once demanded to know why I was texting his best friend
1	I told him to stop being silly , and since then he has seemed fine
1	His best friend and I have become very close , he 's like my older brother , and my partner seems fine with this however he does constantly want to know my relationship with every guy I talk to I have a lot of male friends Since having our little one , he never wants to go out together in the evenings as he does n't want to leave our little one with a babysitter the only babysitters I 'd trust would be close friends or family , and when we do make plans they are often cancelled because he does n't want to anymore so I find myself never going out unless he is at work
1	This never struck me as strange until recently when my mum has made a couple of comments on different occasions along the lines of ' do n't let yourself lose your identity ' or ' you have to put your foot down to that '
1	I am starting to feel quite shut off from my friends as I have no choice but to stay in with baby in the evenings , but I find myself sticking up for him by telling myself that friends could always come round to mine etc
1	Also , when I am out , I find myself having to let him know how long I 'll be etc
1	He has never told me to do this , but I always feel I have to all the same
1	In the mornings , I am always the one to have to get out of bed to find his work clothes for him
1	If I am texting somebody , he always has to know who I am texting and what we are talking about
1	Often , if he wants sex and he thinks I am asleep , he will carry on and do it anyway
1	He has more than once said that he is going to ' rape ' me rather than have sex with me
1	A lot of other little things happen around this , however I find myself struggling to remember them to write them down , if you know what I mean
1	It 's like my mind has cast each separate thing off as insignificant but collectively they could have meant something
1	I was just wondering if any of you could offer some advise
1	As I said , he can be very caring and loving , it is just little things that seem to be ringing bells in me
1	I should also note that I have a history of sexual abuse , so I am not sure whether I 'm trying so hard to avoid this reoccurring that I am over thinking everthing
1	I was on another website called Funadvice , and someone told me about this website
1	I have new teachers this year and I think they 'll lie , betray and cheat
1	He wants me to die the same way he did
1	I know he was standing at the foot of my bed last night and blood was pouring from his mouth
1	He sleeps under my bed at night , and stays awake just to listen to me toss and turn and breathe with fear
1	5I have this repetitive thought in my mind that will not go away
1	6I'm afraid that if I speak in front of someone they 'll record my voice , then they 'll remember it when they see me again and then somehow get me in trouble
1	Then they 'll give mental hospital doctors the videos , so then they can come and take me away
1	9If I crack my knuckles , for example , I have to rub my hands , wrists and arms over and overAbout 2 times
1	If I touch something , I have to touch it all over
1	He wants to slit my throat and rape my corpse
1	I feel like I have everything
1	I hate myself and wish I was dead , or was born into a different family
1	I just want everyone to know I 'm sooo sorry and I wish I could go back and think twice , but I ca n't
1	It 's like , I have my own world inside my head
1	I recorded my thoughts on paperIt kinda scared me
1	I 've tried telling my mom , but she thinks I 'm overreacting or I 'm just trying to get attention
1	I 've been on Yahoo and Funadvice , asking what the hell is wrong with me
1	In case you need to know , my dad is an abusive alcoholic who provided pot for me
1	He gave me pot , ciggies and beer
1	My mom is a pothead , and has been for 3 years
1	I just found out a couple months ago
1	My uncle is living here in our hosue too , because he has no job
1	He 's also an alcoholic and annoys me a lot
1	I have been cutting myself on and off for 3 years on the wrist
1	My mom woke up and did n't even ask me if I was okay or anything
1	My mom has told me I was going to go to a doctor , but she lied
1	I could just as easily drink something and diebut a part of me is buying into time
1	I m having severe marital problems accusing me of having an ongoing affair just for receiving hey how you what s up
1	sms from ok a guy friend who I never spoke to in ages , we had a disagreements major ones and then it was all bliss for a year
1	Now after a year n half of marriage , i m pregnant assuming all was well
1	Then his parents came along and he started acting crabby and betraying me with his parents , fault finding , criticism , stone walling , all the hall marks of abusebut this was so marked in the past one month , like I have never seen before
1	TO add to the woes i m 16 weeks pregnant with our baby
1	I get so tired even thinking of the events but he is now blaming me for starting an argument and showing a lack of family values , inconsistent behavior , anything derogatory that comes to mind
1	Just a week before his parents arrived and one week into their stay with us , he was praising me
1	Suddenly I started seeing him sulk , grouch , never look at me , telling everyone he has to come home to crap , and going to stay in his dad 's room from 630 pm till midnight
1	It was a sharp contrast to what I was seeing in him before they arrived
1	My loneliness was building up , why because I cared about his absence emotionally though he was physically present
1	So one day his dad comes and tells me to stop getting on his sons ' nerves and that I should maintain a diary to discuss issues with him
1	In all truth and honesty , I get up early as he does to make breakfast , brew coffee , pack lunch daily
1	Now the only time I have my times ' of sad thoughts are very rare say in response to a perceived sarcasm or slight
1	Once again I admit it might be my perception or speculation
1	I do n't have an answer to why I do that when I do that
1	The days I do this are on my own or early mornings on weekends , where I do n't expect him to get up that time
1	I keep a check on myself often , I do things I even started writing a book for children , but I think ill have to re focus it on my sour experiences with some of life 's experiences
1	SO getting back to my pent up loneliness , I decided i d visit my parents and be with them during my pregnancy
1	I Now at present and for the past 2 months I did n't receive any calls or replies to my e mails , yes his parents are still with him
1	We had a major fight where he called me ugly short fat   you wear high heels ,   I should have divorced you along time ago , get your crap and furniture out of my house by today or tomorrow better ,   Go abort the baby it will be ugly like you
1	After my flight on SUnday , he tells my parents we did n't have the courtesy to inform him of my arrival
1	That they wanted to talk , and rang my parents repeatedly that day
1	My parents asked why so you can complain more on our daughter
1	Then after my arrival and half a day passed , I was with my mum when she picked his call and he said he missed me loved me etc and my mum told him to write it not just say it , to show it
1	But that did n't warm my heart , his insults were ringing fresh in my ears
1	I wrote back and told him he only had complaints on me all the time , and all of a sudden it got worse
1	we shared a few emails until he stopped emailingmine were enquiries on why he 's acting the way he is
1	When I first met him he was constantly staring at me and smiling and looking dreamy
1	to add I do a lot of gym workout I run for 20 mins constantly
1	Yet to know he said all this drags me into depression
1	Now my parents sent him a few emails that he is being abusive
1	He took it very badly but all they sent were cut n copy diagrams of the abusive cycle
1	No body should correct him or he is never wrong
1	Two months got spent in pure agony , where I came to be relaxed I was n't
1	I was anxious that my marriage is in tatters
1	After sending him a few loving emails , as I was frightened , he replied and Is now saying I started It all4 I did ask him why he was n't picking my parents calls either
1	He said he will throw my coffee table out many times
1	I paid for all furniture and décor at home and even my clothes etc
1	Now He paints a picture that its ALL MY FAULT
1	My parents are so sad they also yell in sadness at me
1	I have had sad moments from time to time , completely not related to this but before I got married
1	Now I feel I just do n't fit into this world and am very exhausted by dramas
1	I feel i m ill equipped for this life
1	I usually hold in all my issues and seldom express them or I Cry as means of coping
1	I m usually happy go lucky , love exercise and fast tracks , I love having friends , But Now as of now IM a real WRECK emotionally
1	I wish I could die or be hit by a truck at high speed while driving
1	For the past 18 months , I 've had bouts of depression due to insecurity , job stress and just general unhappiness with life
1	I spent several years living in different states after grad school , and finally decided to ' settle ' in my current city to be closer to my family
1	Within a couple of months of moving here in the summer of 2011 , I had a great job , and met a great guy
1	Within another 6 months , both my job and relationship started to become very stressful
1	My job is very demanding , since I 'm a managerbut I 'm a middle manager in the federal government , so sometimes things are very bureaucratic and authority is often implied
1	My boyfriend on the other hand , was very emotionally unavailable , and he lost his job about 5 months into our relationship
1	Although I was very supportive , he often made me feel his needs were more important than mine , and he never made me feel loved or appreciated
1	I 've never had a man treat me the way he did , and even though it 's been over a year since we split up , I 'm still having a hard time getting over it
1	I think honestly I 'm mad at myself for allowing someone to treat me that way , and I should 've ended it much sooner
1	Every time I would try to , he would say just enough ' nice ' things to keep me around
1	I finally got upset and walked out of his house one night , and never looked back
1	I was proud of myself for walking away , but I think I did n't really get the closure I needed
1	Back to the job stressI feel I 'm in a difficult situation because I have worked in federal service for 8 years
1	I 've built a reputation and have many benefits with my job but it 's not rewarding to me
1	I 've been in my current position for almost 3 years and it 's killing meI built this program from the ground up and it 's become very successful
1	I have been applyinglooking for other jobs for over a year
1	I 've had 3 interviews in the past month for 3 different jobs
1	I know my references had been checked with 2 positions , which usually happens when they are getting ready to make an offer
1	However , I 've recently just found out that I did n't get either position
1	So far , I have only applied with federal agencies , mainly because I have a leg up as an internal candidate
1	I 've applied for several positions where I currently work over the past year , and I 'm starting to feel as if someone may be sabotaging me
1	I hate to think that way but I 've never had so much trouble moving ahead in my career
1	The only thing that keeps me going are my friends , family , and I really love the city I live in
1	I do n't know , 5 years ago I would've never thought I would be 32 , still single and hating my job
1	I feel like I need to seek professional help or I 'm going to have a meltdown
1	I identify myself as M4D which stands for mother 4 daughter
1	Just this past Oct our world became rocked by what is apparently teenage depression
1	Literally our lives have seemed to change overnight as there were little to no signs
1	When school started this year around Sept she began to complain of stomach pain , headaches , trouble sleeping   a good bit of weight loss
1	She had to be away from us for a few days that seemed like an eternity   then she went to out patient treatment with support groups with other teens etc
1	She has missed at least a month of school at this point undergoing this treatment which now seems to be just more of the same menagerie of coping skills , etc
1	of depression other than a great grandfather who had situational seasonal depression due to the loss of his life partner my grandmother
1	My daughter has had seemingly some PMS this last year   weepy around the start of her periods   easily irritated by her brothers etc
1	When this depression began we noticed the pattern of relapses exactly right at a few days prior to her cycle   thru her cycle
1	They put her on Lexapro for the depression   then Lamictal they said to control the mood swinging she was doing around her periods
1	Once we would get in a happier place after a bout of depression the period would be on it 's way   seemed to wreck everything   we 'd be in the abiss again
1	They are now talking of putting her on birth control pills as this calms down the hormone drops etc
1	We 've never fully been told she has BiPolar condition
1	is clinical depression   GAD but one Dr confides in me that Lamictal would only be added in case of BiPolar

1	with 4 young sons say his wife does n't inspire him , what doe he really mean
1	Last August my husband announced his dying love for me and in many ways showed how detestable I was to him
1	He did not let me touch him much less get near him
1	He gave me the silent treatment and purposely withheld his affection from me
1	I never felt so much pain in my entire life
1	He made unexpected plans to go away to visit his parents without me so he could let them know that we   as a family have relocated to another state and are doing well
1	His visit must have been so passionate that when he returned to me , he was cold as ice through his speech , his behavior , his expressions and his comments
1	When I asked him , he said that taking time off that week really helped him confirm how much he wants to divorce me
1	He said during that week , he thought a lot about us and has decided that we 're not compatible
1	He tells me that my behavior is unacceptable to him and I 'm no longer lovable in his eyes
1	I do n't inspire him
1	He blames me for his friends leaving him , blames me for the debt we 've incurred , blames me for not having the reputation he desires , blames me for how poor we are , blames me for not being a stronger social bug so he can bring friends to be entertained
1	He claims I 'm trying to isolate him
1	He even told me son he 's dating to discipline and teach mommy a lesson , to be nicer and friendlier because mommy 's mean and does n't like visitors and friends
1	Now , when I do something that angers my son age 11 he 'll steal my things and hide them so I ca n't use them
1	That 's his way of punishing me
1	He even wrote me a letter stating that I better not do anything to make him angry , otherwise he will get upset
1	He wrote in another letter that if I hit him , he will not hold back on hitting me even if he gets in trouble
1	My other sons stand up to me
1	When I tell them to do something , they 'll flat out say no
1	He says my weaknesses I 'm an introvert shame him and do n't bring honor to him
1	I do n't inspire him
1	And so , I asked him how might I inspire him
1	And he says , to know that I 'll have to go read it in a book
1	The only thing I 'm clear about is , this mind game he 's playing hurts my heart and thus is playing truth or dare with my heart
1	I have 4 sons who are watching their father   and I need to know if I should stay , change and keep the family together , hopefully
1	Or if I should just face my demons and go becuase all that he 's saying are just excuses to cover up his own selfishness that will lead me back down the road of a shattered heart
1	I was very happly married for 30 years and one day my husband just said I not in love with you anymore , I had no idea he was unhappy
1	I am crushed and I seem to walk around in circles all day thinking why
1	How could this happen , I think he is sleeping with the 22 year tart two doors down
1	He is very cold and angry to me know , I wonder what he is thinking , if there are any men out there who have been through this please explain what is going on
1	My husband lost his dad 1 year ago and I thought he was just sad , I tried to talking to him but nothing
1	He drinks a lot now and smokes which he never did
1	The girl he is hanging around already has a child to some man and she drinks a lot and smokes and she has very little friends because she tends to sleep with friends partners
1	I do nt want this man back but I ca nt get him out of my head , I am thinking of him constantly and I dream of him
1	What is wrong with me , I am getting stronger I can feel it and I am keeping myself busy and I have councelling and my doctor gave me sleeping pills
1	How long does it take to get him out of my head
1	I have no comunication with him at all and he bags me to the kids , I am staying nice about him to the kids but it is hard , I just want him out
1	Hi , i 'm 22 and currently 25 weeks pregnant with my second child
1	I left my boys ' dad when i was 9 weeks pregnant as i finally realised it was nt good for my nearly 3 year old son or the new baby , as our son was starting to fight his dad back when he got violent towards me , and the fact i was pregnant with his 2nd child did nt stop him either
1	I'v been living in a refuge miles away from him and my family since november and am really starting to get down about being a single mum to 2 boys who 's father does nt care about them
1	I grew up with an alcoholic dad myself so know more than enough about how neglect from parents can affect kids in later life and i 'm really worried my unborn child will resent me , not so much my 3 year old as he remembers why we left and tells me alot how he 's happy daddy does nt live in ' this house ' with us
1	I 've been to the doctors recently but keep getting told its just pregnancy hormones but i really do nt think it is any more , is there anywhere i can go thatwill take me seriously and not just blame hormones
1	My son is 41 and has been clean   sober for eleven years
1	For the most part he is a happy hard working man who loves his family
1	However , he has these anger issues where if something is displeasing him sometimes he will go off is the only way I can explain it
1	It is truly his problem and people around him are walking on eggshells when this happens until he gets over it As his mother I feel bad for Michael and the people around him , I never had an anger issue and his father did n't either
1	I have talked to him about it and let him know that I feel it is his responsiblity to do something about it
1	I do n't know how to help him
1	In the latest episode he caught some teens drinking at a party at his house and when Michael lectured the teens about it , got smart mouthed with Michael and he almost put his hands on this 17 yr old
1	How can I help my son be a better man
1	I was physically abused as a child and have been in denial for years
1	My sister faced the fact a long time ago but abuse still has effected both of our lives in negative ways
1	Although our personalities are so different we both approached dealing with it differently
1	Both of us tend to go after abusive menit 's like we drew them
1	We have both excepted we can not handle close and intimate relationships with men and have abandoned ever having long term intimate relationships
1	I dealth with life in a forgiving way and allowed people to walk all over me
1	The more a man would be abusive to me , it was like I would try harder and harder to please them , not wanting to let go and the more I forgave their actions and made it okay to treat me abusively
1	Over the last few years my anger has surfaced , I am out of denial and I have times of rages and have become somewhat aggressive
1	How much of this is from my Bipolar and how much is due to the abuse , I do not know
1	Perhaps the abuse has lead to Bipolar , I do n't know
1	How has other people dealt with physical abuse as a child and how has it effected your life and how has it effected your behavior as an adult
1	Were you angry at yourMom for allowing the abuse and do you see your mother was abused also and scared
1	I do nt really know how to say it , i m rubbish with putting how i feel into words
1	I m and 18 year old girl i have a boyfriend but i 've always had commitment issues , my ex boyfriend use to punish me sexually for like not listening to him or things as petty as that which then made me believe that was the only thing i was good for
1	I was 16 he was 22

1	I ve never been a popular girl , i never really had the chance as i was in 5 primary schools so never really got to make a bond with anyone
1	Then in high school i did meet a select few whom i could get on with but i left half way through 5th year to go to college where i never made any friends and in return i lost all of my friends from school
1	I never got the chance to spend any time with anyone because my ex was really controlling an now not one of them have the time of day for me at all
1	Recently i got myself into debt with the loan company known as wonga and thought i could pay it off with my wages from where i work but once i done that my work cut my hours down and now i m struggling to pay them , i owe my dad umpteen phone bills and sets of dig money
1	I m also getting really confused too easy these days
1	Sometimes i don even know why i go somewhere never mind what day it is which really worries me
1	I think i ve covered it all and to sum it up My family , boyfriend and even new people i meet think i m a heartless   and they just bring me down , i have no friends i have no one to talk to what so ever and i m in debt upto my eyeballs and i struggle to get by daily
1	I do nt quite know where to fit this bit in but i with feeling so down i am begining to not even believe that this is real , i 've been drinking heavyly , i also self harm and on two occassions i 've took pills till i get really drowsey but i m too scared to actually kill myself   x i do nt quite know what i should do anymore
1	I 'm 20 and I have a little sister who 's 10 who is going through the same thing as I am
1	My mom has anger problems and she started beating me since I was 2
1	She even tried to drown me
1	I am extremely smart and when I was 8 , my IQ was 128
1	My doctor said because I was tall , there was n't anything wrong with me
1	I hated people and I still do for no reason , I was sad all the time , and I hated myself
1	One moment I may appear happy , another moment I may appear angry or sad
1	Sometimes I 'm very smart , sometimes I 'm kinda dumb
1	I start crying whenever the celebrity does n't do something I like
1	note Do n't forget my 10 year old sister is going through the same thing
1	And I ca n't go get an actual doctor 's help in real life because I 'm poor , and my family will shun me if they find out I 'm getting help
1	I 'm 16 always been depressed
1	One of my friends ca n't help cuz she just wo nt or she s just sad herself
1	My friends are dicks and i just feel lonley whenever i m with them
1	When I spoke to the counsellor yesterday I was like yay i feel pretty good
1	But like an hour later and i was like i m going to end it tonight
1	Of course I do n't really want to die I just want this to all be over
1	I have a way that I want to kill myself , but i m not sure it will work
1	I just really want this all to be over but I know that Ill be hurting people
1	I guess I do nt want to die , like if i could i would want to enjoy life
1	But I just do n't , i never truthfully have
1	I cut , not very deep , just enough to see the blood come to the surface and watch a few drips of blood run down my arm
1	It comforts me , make me not feel completely numb and helps me express my emotions
1	I can feel external pain and it distracts me and helps me express what I feel inside
1	I do n't wan't to stop cutting but I know that I need to
1	I have started to see a psychiatrist to help me with my depression and she has asked me if I selfharm or think about suicide , I always say no
1	But I do selfharm and I sometimes do want to terminate my life
1	I do n't have the courage to talk to her about this because I am scared what measures she will take
1	I already see her twice a week and am starting a support group
1	She also made a side comment about monitoring me even more closely if I did selfharm or have suicidal thoughts
1	Do you have any tips for me about how to stop cutting and have the motivation to do so
1	I really do n't know how I would cope without selfharm
1	Okay my ex husband and I divorced almost three years ago over the way he treated me at times and I felt maybe it was just time to move on but during the whole seperation time I kept going back to him wanting him but not wanting to work things out because he pushing it so hard to work things out I felt like I could not make a good choice on what to do so I moved on and meet a man and almost two years later I remarried I thought was a wonderful person not so has done nothing but cheated on me since we got married now going through another divorce , So now my ex has moved back into town with his new girlfriend and he told me how much he wanted me back but his emotions are mixed up on what to do about this and when we did talk about getting back together and the next thing I know he 's pushing me away and now I ca n't get him out of my head I need to get over this if he does n't want me and wants that his girlfriend then why does he even start acting like he wants me back and talking about wanting me back now I am just hurt over this how he is doing me now I need to get past this but I need to know how to get past this does anybody know any advice for this issue
1	Hi everyone I 'm probably going to sound like a horrible parent , but I ca n't figure out whether my 12yr old daughter is depressed or being plain selfish
1	My daughter has started cutting herself , but it only happens when my husband and I do n't give her what she wants
1	When she wants more money or wants to go out late at night or go spend an entire week at her boyfriends house we say no , so she goes to her room , cuts herself then comes to show me
1	I try to talk to her and ask her why she does this , so she starts telling me that I am a horrible parent and that I do n't love her , she says things like oh you just want to hit me do n't you or if you could have a do over you would n't want me
1	When I pry more she gets very frustrated with me then starts telling me that she 's depressed and just wants to die
1	We try to spend more time with her , but she tells us to go away and then complains we do n't spend time with her
1	My husband used to take her out for lunch etc , but only stopped cos she did n't want to go and now complains that he does n't
1	She 's even stopped us from spending time with her 4yr old sister cos she accuses us of favoring the other over her
1	I 've started noticing that she gets like this when she does n't get what she wants
1	The day would be going great and we would all be happy chatting and then she 'll make a demand we say no so she runs into her room and cuts herself
1	I do n't believe in giving in as I know this will only make things work , but its getting to the point where you think maybe I should
1	I 'm currently pregnant with our 3rd child and she wants me to get rid of it , I told her that it is not an option , she should n't even be asking me this and if I did it means I wold have to kill the baby , she just shrugged her shoulders and said well I suppose you could look at it that way
1	I have made arrangements to take her to counseling , but I just ca n't help but think she 's being a selfish little princess
1	My husband and I are prepared to be the reason for all this , as we are aware that we are not the most perfect of parents and maybe our problems have flowed onto her , but its just the way she 's been acting is making us feel like she 's just being a spoiled little brat
1	I know she has esteem issues and probably other issues
1	I am in fear that one day she is actually going to cut too much and kill herself
1	I do n't want to give in , but I wonder should I let her have what she wants
1	Then after all her yelling and wanting to die , she 'll wake up the next day with a big smile and go out with her friends
1	I 'm in tears when she walks out the door because of sheer frustration
1	I would be grateful and thankful for any advice during this tough phase of my life
1	I had a love marriage and got married in April 2014
1	We are a well educated couple and my husband has a degree from one of the premier MBA institutes in India
1	He earns very well and I earned a decent salary which was more than enough for me
1	Prior to being married we shared our outing bills
1	I did ask him if it is going to be the same post marriage and he refused
1	My husband bought a very expensive TV and refrigerator and much later randomly commented I did not pay for it
1	He started telling me I do not share the rent and the internet expenses and that he had to put more money in the joint account
1	The prior instances might sound too silly to some people who share all the expenses post marriage but I felt insulted every time because he knew how much i earned and yet expects me to share expenses which were more than my 1 month 's salary
1	Also I do not believe in 5050 sharing of expenses because I believe it is one household
1	My inlaws are way too involving in their children ’s lives and kept coming every month post we got married
1	My FIL is very money minded and way too stingy
1	He has passed very insulting comments on me and even criticized my parents in the past
1	I would not want to get into the comments made by him
1	My MIL is a brilliant person and is a gem
1	She is way too dominated by her husband and can not speak up when necessary
1	Everyday post office hours and weekends were spent at home while he was always gaming and I feeling lonely
1	I started gaming too just to spend sometime with him but my erratic office hours dint allow that
1	Our last meal together must have been in sometime in April
1	He kept telling me I forced him to get married which is not true and no sensible educated person can ever be forced to marry
1	I knew of it before we got married and wanted to be with him even more to take care of him and fight out his health problem together
1	He seemed to be a beautiful person which is one of the reasons I married him
1	He has visited the best of doctors in the country but his problem has not been detected till now
1	Yet I wanted to be with him and stand by
1	If he gets tired he can not speak a word
1	I am a marathon runner and have completed very difficult trails in my runs and walks
1	The major blow was in July when during an argument he raised his hand on me
1	I asked him not to do it and leave me as it was hurting but he did it further
1	In return I hit him back
1	Basically showed him the mirror and he cold not take it
1	I was asked to leave and I came to my parents house which is in a different state
1	Its been 25 months now that I have heard my husband 's voice
1	His parents were in the UK for 2 months since July and returned last month
1	They are coming over this month to discuss this matter with my family
1	Before I left my husband told me there is no way we are getting back
1	His family has time and again blamed me for everything and complain to my parents about how terrible I am
1	My husband comes out to be a very nice person and none believe me
1	My inlaws have not contacted me even once post I was asked to move out
1	But his behavior has changed my outlook
1	If he can bail out on me once he can do it again anytime
1	He depends completely on his parents to take a step forwardHe decided to get married to me and now threw me out of his life while he is happily living
1	I am tired to the end of my wits of taking all the blame all the time
1	My parents asked me to keep communication open with him which i did
1	I occasionally ask him how his health is and wish him on any festivals
1	I am not sure if I should stay in this marriage and work it out
1	Nor do i know what is going on in his and his family 's mind
1	I 've been at this 25 years
1	How do I accept the pain and integrate it into my life
1	At this point I have chosen to just hold up in my house and be alone
1	I do NOT have a desire to be suicidal , I just had my brother commit suicide and I can not do that to my family though they do not truly care about me
1	I am alone in life , and have lost all my nononline friends due to my depression and traumatization after he died
1	now I just feel Like to stop being a burden to others I must leave them and say goodbye and just life alone with the pain and my dog and just survive somehow
1	  I can try to distract myself , I can try to do opposite behaviors , I can try to inquire about my thoughts and I can try cognitive mental therapy and nothing elevates the pain
1	I think all I can is embrace the pain and accept it
1	I truly have been trying for 25 years in therapy and am not just whining
1	I know they all are trying very hard to help me and are sincere
1	I think all I can do is live with the pain
1	Hi all I ve been having some issues with my family 's understanding of my condition   I want to thank everyone at MedHelp who has been so kind to help me
1	My doctor put me on prozac 20 mg 1xday for anxiety last week and I started taking the pills last Thursday pm so I have been taking them for one week only today was my last pill
1	My parents are against psychiatry completely and my mom found the pills today
1	We got in a big fight and she asked me to flush them
1	I was n't reluctant , I just did n't want the drama so I flushed them gladly
1	I also did n't like how the antidepressants made me so forgetful
1	I have only been taking them a week
1	I see my doctor again on the 18 and I am telling him that I want to stop the medication all together
1	I thought I needed it , but I really want to conquer my issues with therapy and the now loving support of my family in any means nonpharmocological of course
1	I wo n't be able to see him until then
1	Will I have horrible withdrawal symptoms since I only took them for one week
1	My father killed himself years ago and I was half way around the world away from home and never blamed myself but now I just broke up with my wife and I just do n't want to go on anymore
1	I worry that my adult daughter might blame herself for my choice
1	She know that my wife was cheating and there is no chance of fixing the marriage and I have filed for divorce based on adultery
1	We have been apart for a couple of months but I see myself going downhill fast
1	I have not been to work for the last two weeks and now I do n't want to go outside because I do n't want to tell another person why my wife is not with me
1	I did talk to a shrink last week but only felt worse after I left the office
1	My daughter lives in another state and it 's just not doable to live closer but she wants me to move close to or even in with her
1	I am afraid if I follow my dad and I stop my pain what does it do to her
1	She does not know how my father died as I always told her it was an accident but if I ca n't stage the perfect accident she will know that my death was not an accident
1	She calls me every day and sometimes two or three times a day
1	I think she suspects I am tired with life and I want to quit
1	Funny part is I miss my wife so much and going to bed without talking or touching is the worst time of the day
1	My sister went for a playdate with another mum who has a daughter 3 and a half and a boy 8 months
1	When she got there the mother had cut herself and saying how she abuses the kids and does n't want to live anymore she 's on ice and hates her kids and that the reason her daughters dad is in jail is because she let him rape her
1	My sister offered to take the girl home with her for the night , my sister also has a 3 year old and 1 year old daughter
1	She could n't take the boy because his dad woulda came around a possibly killed my sister for taking him
1	Tilly , who is the little girl can barely talk , she is on the same academic level as my son who is 18 months
1	My sister bathed her a d said she was so dirty like she had n't been washed for days
1	So we think her step dad maybe raping her to and she has bruises all over her body
1	Were so affraid as her son also has bruises on him

1	Just turn 50 had a period that last more than seven day dr order ultrasound here is the results can u help me understand how abnormal the ultrasound is Transabdominal and transvaginal imaging was performed
1	I know that I 've been correctly diagnosed about the bipolar disorder , but I seem to have every one of the ' symptoms ' of BPD
1	I feel like I 'm a classic example
1	I get really clingy to people really fast and then I get paranoid that they will leave , even if there is nothing wrong with the relationship
1	I 'm always making up these extravagant things to tell friends just so they will be interested and stick around now please do n't get me wrong
1	I tell people way too personal things at the beginning of a relationship because I feel like I am super close to them after having talked to them for 5 minutes
1	If I have plans with someone and they go wrong or they get cancelled I immediatly think that it 's because I 've done something wrong , and that 's all I can think about
1	I am really compulsive as far as spending money is concerned I spent over ten grand in 3 months
1	I always feel like I have to buy something or I do n't feel right
1	Now I know this is related to depression , but I feel like I am ' nothing ' all of the time , but especially when I do n't have any friends to be around , or when I have burned every bridge there was and I do n't have anyone around that I feel ' cares ' about me
1	And then , when I do n't feel entirely empty I just feel like I am a horrible person all of the time
1	I have changed my mind about what I want to do with my life about a million times mostly because I do n't have the drive , but for a better example , I have decided to go back to school in the Fall
1	The idea came to me one night , that night I applied for Financial aid , and decided on a whim that I wanted to teach High School
1	Two weeks later , still wanting to go back to school , another whim came to me and I wanted to go into speech pathology in the school instead
1	I know that a lot of the above issues can be directly related to having bipolar disorder , I am just concerned that there are too many correlations with BPD to not at least check into it
1	I would hate to go through life not knowing and then find out later that some things were the way they were because I did n't address the issue
1	Can anyone who has this disorder give me any information about additional symptoms , things I can talk to my p doc about , or even just tell me I 'm over reacting
1	It 's about my past Please do n't judge and I am just telling you what happened and I what had experienced My molestation started when I was either four or five and my nephew , he used to stick his finger and his penis in me , he used too make me kiss his penis , between the molestation he used to kick , punch or slap me and it continued for five years , from then onward I have always been sick to my stomach , I had gained a lot of weight since then
1	Last year I star having a lot of bad dreams and some really good ones I will tell you everything that happen in the dreams after this After my grandad die , I had stopped having my period and I told myself it 's just stress related And the dreams were still coming In between the whole I can not speak time , I had one period that was in April and after that I had none but stomach had began to get bigger , I felt more nauseated than before , my boobs were always sore , I had alot cramping and shoulder pain and I was always tired One day I woke up at five am with pain in my stomach , the pain worst than my normal period pains , at one time I thought I was being stabbed will a knife , another time I thought I was being ripped apart but after an half later the pain began to fade away I mostly laid down in my bed and cried and later on that day the pain came in waves and told a friend what was happening to We continued talking about it and we came to the conclusion that I was pregnant After that day I told myself Ok i m pregnant As the weeks flew by my stomach had gotten bigger , I had a lot pain , I had nightmares , I had dreams were I was in labor , after labor , playing with a baby girl and even cuddling with her During those weeks , I had told a friend about everything and we named whatever that was in my tummy Angel and everyday I would rub my tummy , sleep , drink and eat , at five I would go to sleep and get back up at seven and do it all over again Til one day I was home and started having this really bad pain in my stomach but I ignored it , later around nine and ten in the time I had urge to push and began pushing for some reason , after a half of a hour pushing I decided to stop At 2024 weeks I woke up and I had the most excruciating if ever had so I got up and used the bathroom and as I was going to flush the toilet , I saw to little feet in the bowl covered in blood I stood there in shocked because I thought I was losing my mind Then I saw this white thing dangling from me so I pulled it out and more blood came out then I flushed the toilet cause I did n't want no one to know what had happen to me
1	After that I went into my bedroom and cried
1	Last december I still had those nightmares then an evening I was in my bed and my nephew saw and he told my mother
1	That night I told my mother about my molestation and she said it was child play What should I do
1	When I was younger I went to a psychiatrist but did n’t like it at all
1	I do nt really like to be but i think when i was younger i felt as though i needed to be
1	One of the questions I had was that after I stopped taking paxil i noticed that i was very jittery my hands shake and i can not control it
1	I usually can not notice but if someone i do n’t know is sitting across the table from me they can
1	It is embarrassing but i assumed it would go away after i stopped the medication and it never did
1	I stopped taking antidepressants when I was a sophomore in highs school and am now a freshman in college
1	But A few months ago I felt as though i was very stressed out and i felt emotional unstable like i would cry about nothing and i would emotionally break down So i went to my doctor and asked to be put on wellbutrin becaue I had taken it before and then experience was much better then that of paxil and effexor
1	I took Wellbutrin for about a Month and a half and then stopped
1	I took it more because it made me feel calm and made me not stress out about school and other things
1	I feel as though if I take a pill it will fix everything but I do n’t know if it is working or if it is just me thinking its working
1	Do n’t know if this makes since so if it does not , you do n’t have to answer Finally , my doctor knows that I have stopped taking the medication and do not wish to see a psych but has recommended that I be on medication of some type
1	I was diagnosed with clinical depression and I think it runs in my family because my mom has been taking paxil for as long as I can remember to the point were if she does not i can tell because her moon changes
1	I think my brother is also on ambien , my mom takes that too She is a nurse so i m sure she knows what she is doing but i do n’t want to explain all of this to her at the moment because of her own situation
1	I do n’t feel as though I need to see any one or need to be on medication because I ’m depressed anymore
1	But it is hard to concentrate a lot and I feel as though I am ADD , and the wellbutrin helped me stay up late and concentrate on my school work
1	But Rarly do I feel depressed to the point were I want to be on medication for it
1	Maybe it is because I have grown older and matured but I would like your opinion
1	I 'm not sure I trust my psychiatrist like I did before
1	I 've been trying to taper off my Prozac for about 5 months from 40 mg
1	I was originally at 60 , but we lowered it to 40 last year
1	Anyway , when I went from 40 to 30 , I felt more sensitive to things around me and like it was easier to get upset and want to cry
1	But that got better after I think it was 2 months
1	It 's been another 3 months since I went from 30 to 20 , and I feel more sensitive than last time we went down
1	I 'm also having coldlike symptoms almost constantly and feeling much more anxiousnot quite to the level I was before , but I have n't felt this anxious in a long while
1	And for the last month or so , I 've been able to sleep 24 hours straight I literally did that once , and have had to force myself out of bed for dinner a few other days
1	But I want to be me again , and if that means I have to take them for now , I will
1	My father was a very abusive man , beat on my mom , my brother and my sistersHe was always drunk or highHe would always sneak in my room and touch me and say i m gon na tell your mom if u peed to bedHe would make me let him check meHe would make me lay on the bed and then get on top of me thank god my sisters came inHe would alway make me take a bath and he would be the one who had to wash me
1	I tried to forget about it pretend it did nt happen so i would nt be in trouble with my momFor years i have kept it to myself afraid everyone would hate me and , i finally told my brother and sister thinking i would have more support but that has never happenedMy dad got married and him and his wife have nothing to do with any of his kids and pretty much harassas all of usI feel i am not good enough for anything or anyone , i lost alot of weight but i get depressed so bad and it seems food is all i havei do nt know what to do with myself anymoreI am always angry and depressed and feeling alonei need some help please
1	My girlfriend told me she was recently drugged at a wine bar and made a unclear fuzzy desicion to drive home and allow the man that was coming on to her to come back to hear apt
1	She says she has a very fuzzy memory of doing this and just bits and parts of driving home and telling him where to park , where to meet her , and saying goodbye to her mother and going back to her apt while her son was sleeping
1	She only recalls small parts of the night , un able to move or resist by that time she was home Naked in bed with him She does n't recall if there was intercourse , she remembers going into her sons room to ask for help but she was smiling , happy , she believes the effect of the drug
1	and she said he left soon after that She woke up feeling very sick , hangover like , and recalls only having two glasses of white wine the night before
1	She believes she was drugged she threw up twice and noticed something blue in the toilet What do I do now

1	I spent more then a year in the relationship with a man in his forties , and i came to the conclusion we may both have bpd
1	I had some issues with my father despite his physical presence , he was emotionally detached and judgemental , and I never really manage to build real emotional ties with him
1	Before meeting this man , I did have some complicated relationships , but nothing that would categorize me as a borderline
1	From the outside , I am bright and sociable , with lots of social connections but , inside , I often feel empty and insecure
1	He has a history of unresolved problems , broken marriages and relationships , low selfesteem and a tendency not to solve the problems when they arise , but to simply run away
1	His has no real friends , but rather acquaintances he sees once in a while
1	While most of the time he claims to be content with the situation , during the weekends and holidays he tends to fall into crises , feeling inadequate and left alone
1	Some time ago , after a quarrel , he took a car and caused minor car accident purposely
1	During the honeymoon faze , we often discussed our future together , choose the names for our soontobeborn kids , spending days and nights planning , cuddling , and having the greatest sex
1	He was trying to explain that it was hurting him badly , but I was crossing all the boundaries , believing that he should be able to fall back into my arms , forgetting useless fight , as I was able to do so myself
1	After eight months of crazy love   pushing him away cycles , I fell that he was becoming more and more emotionally unavailable , and I turned into some kind of needy monster I was escalating fights only if he looked at another woman , let alone meeting some of them in my absence
1	I made some kind of plan for our relationship we had to stick to , although he was telling me he preferred to let things happen and grow by themselves
1	After a major fight , he stopped calling me for almost a month
1	I was going coldturkey , and managed to hoover him back
1	During next few months , he was leaving all the time
1	Once , in a rage , he even said something like Oh , your daddy was absent , so you pushing me to be with you instead   so , he was aware of the problem , but it did n't stop him from constantly rubbing some salt into my wound
1	In the same period , there were some great moments he asked me to move in and if I wanted us to move together abroad
1	He said he wanted to spoil me with his attention and I was happy
1	We had another fight , when he wanted to leave , and I physically tried to stop him from leaving   I tried to stop him by hugging him , closing the doors and holding the keys but without hitting him
1	He pushed me to the floor and left , and I decided not to call him to come back ever again and then , the magic happened for the first time , he came back by himself , telling me he knows what my problem is , and he is going to deal with it
1	He 'll was going to be there for me , but we 're not in a relationship any more he 's going to see other women , even have sex with them if he wants to   just to have his own rights , that he will , or will not exercise
1	I was broken , and asked to be informed before it happens , so I can leave , but he said having to tell me would condition his behaviour
1	Two weeks later , he left , telling me he had lost all the feelings for me
1	He reactivated the account on a dating site where we met , and went on a travel by himself although he wanted us badly to go together , only few days earlier
1	I visited his profile from the account he did n't know about , and he sent me a message
1	I started conversation with him in disguise , asking what he was up to
1	When he came back home , I called him , and we have a nice conversation
1	He told me he just need a bit of space , and not to take his online activities so seriously
1	I taught he wanted only too hookup Later , he sent another message to my alterego , writing he grew very fond of talking to her , and he was ready to exchange emotions and enjoy life but he had an experience with an overly attached person a while ago
1	He stripped me of everything we shared , even of my gender
1	I went beserk , called him , and told him all kind of stuff
1	He cried , said I never really loved him , but the picture I 've created That is absolutely untrue
1	I love him to pieces , with all his flows
1	We have almost no contact for almost two weeks
1	I 'm trying to recover , remember who I was , putting myself into focus again
1	But , at the same time , I am missing him to death , and I feel crushed because it seems he went over me in a lightning speed
1	I started seeing his ex counselor she says I am giving up my own self , putting it in the hands of the person that does n't know how to deal with his own and that the biggest difference between two of us is , although we 're both a mess , at least I am trying to fix the situation , and he 's always finding excuses , running away
1	Will I ever be able to resolve my problems without some serious therapy
1	My 13 year old son thinks I chose my fiance over him
1	I have been a single mom   lived   my parents house
1	I just recently purchased a brand new home w my fiance   his child in April
1	It was hard for all of us to adjust to eachothers ways   schedulesI can admit me   my fiance were arguing quite often about the littlest things
1	My son would go to his dads house every other weekends also
1	We had only lived in the house for 3 weeks   My son went   tld his dad there was arguing in the home   my sons dad served me w ex parte papers
1	We go to court   court recommends supervised visits   also if I would like to havemy son that I would move out of my home   back to my parents house
1	I was tld by my son that his dad has told him that he wo nt be able to see me for 2 yrs if he do nt tell the court that I need help   need supervised visitsMy son says I chose my fiance cuz I wouldve moved to my parents
1	My son says he do nt want to have supervised visits but his dad tld him its me who wants it
1	I have been seeing my son in supervised visits but its really hard   do feel my son is unhappy there
1	My fiance   i have stopeed our arguing   our relationship has gotten better , but I still want my son in my life
1	I went to my sons football game a few months ago   his father told him do nt look at your mom or talk to your mom because she do nt care about you   my son listened to his dadI told the court my sons dad brainwashes my son   the father argues that he does not
1	My sons dad is making my son believe i , a bad , pther   making my son believe that I chose my fiance over my sonI do nt know what alse to do   do nt want him to feel that i chose my fiance
1	After hearing myself and others refer to dealing with my daughter as walking on eggshells I was browsing a bookstore and found a book by Paul Mason and Randi Kreger called Stop Walking on Eggshells
1	On a whim , I picked it up , read the back cover and thought ' my God , this is her I purchased the book and started reading the symptoms and most of them rang true to what myself and others have seen in my daughter
1	Unfortunately , we do n't know how to point out the difficulties that we and others have because we really do n't want to anger her because of the ways she responds to things that we point out
1	I have n't read that far into the book to know if it deals with confronting a person who we feel meets the symptoms that were described , but will hopefully continue reading and find something to help us
1	She and her sister were both sexually abused by their fatherI've learned that it was n't my fault and have learned to not take the blame for what he has donebut her sister has dealt with what happened and we feel that she has not
1	Can anyone give us some suggestions on the best way to get her to seek first of all , a true diagnosisthen some treatmentso that we can see her happy and content with her life and not prone to create drama or ruin normal adult relationships that she tries to establish , and recognize that she needs help
1	I 'm new to this site so do n't mind me if I 'm not 100 on what I 'm doing
1	A couple years back I had extreme depression , anxiety and I suffer from bipolar
1	It was from the age of ten to eighteen , I 'm currently nineteen and have been clean from cuttingburningpill overuse etc for about four months now and off all medication
1	Two days ago I got the implant as I recently found out that I have polystistic ovaries and was told this is the only thing that will help with my periods and give me a higher chance of being able to have kids but have found that ever since the day I got it in I have been very angrysnappy and very depressed and suicidal , I 've heard around that the implant can cause this so I guess I 'm just asking whether anyone else have experienced this depression with the implant , what the best thing for me to do would be and also whether I should keep the implant and go back on my meds as my fiancé is finding it hard to handle my depression again as he was around for the first time and it causes him depression also and pretty much just any other advice you 'd be willing to give
1	Thank you all so much for your time , it means a great deal
1	I wrote last week about having a lot of things going on w feeling depressed
1	It seems like i m stuck in a rut   i m getting restless   frustrated and almost like i m in a cage if that makes sense
1	I go to work ,   now 4 some reason every1 has changed over the passed weekvery rude to me   disrespectful
1	  treat me like i m a slave and I have a degree higher than most there   do the smallest job probably possible
1	I had to move back in w my parents after my fiancé spilt which is in a condo   I feel I get no privacy , very little peace   quitei feel like i m losing my mind
1	My doc cut my meds way down   i m not sure if that has anything to do with it but it really does n’t matter bc now he wo nt work with me
1	How can I fix this rut with out just running away bc that ’s not even possible I just ca nt keep living this way
1	I m so exhausted and feel like I could fall right to sleep but ca nt bring myself to lay down
1	I mean I take meds for my mood and anxiety I have bipolar but it seems like nothing is helpingnothing at all
1	Dear Doctors , I am a GBM , stage IV patient
1	Please tell me about the meaning of my last MRI
1	A CLUSTER of small enhancing nodules along the right lateral cerebellum and right brachium pontis with minor susceptibility and mild high FLAIR singnal that are also grossly unchanged UNQUOTE I thank you very much for your kind reply
1	So i m not sure if this is depression or stress or some neurological thing , but i thought i would ask here before my doctors appointment Monday just to get an idea
1	For the past few days i ve been feeling really , out of it is the only real way to put it
1	I m pretty tired , and it feels like i m in sort of a brain fog , i ca nt really concentrate
1	It also feels like really aware , likei ca nt fully relax or do something without my brain telling me in feeling funny
1	I 've had trouble sleeping all my life and usually could n't fall asleep before the sun started coming updespite laying in bed for hours
1	So i put up a thick blanket to block out the light so when i could fall asleep at dawn when i was finally tired enough
1	I 've been doing that for like a year but it makes me over sleep
1	I would wake up late , but never feel like i do now
1	I m anxious and my brain feels fuzzy and in worried , which is making me anxious
1	I took down the blanket because lately i ve been able to fall asleep early , like 10 or so because i m so tired
1	I 'm 48 years old and going into menopause
1	I 'm still menstruating monthly but the periods are very light
1	My issue is about a week before my period I get severe PMS
1	I 'm not sure if its so much worse because i 'm going into menopause or if this is the new normal
1	I ca n't really talk to anyone because I 'm angry at everyone for whatever stupid reason
1	I become very emotional and cry alot , my face breaks out in huge weltsnot pimples more like blisters in the same areas every timeThe worst part is I get waves of such severe depression it scares me
1	It does subside after a few minutes but I 'm still depressed
1	If this decides to come for more than just those few minutes about 45 times a day I ca n't see how I will cope
1	I 'm very happy otherwise , just started a new job , moved to a wonderful home in a great town , my children are stable
1	I can feel it come on and I ca n't move or talk
1	It stops me dead in my tracks and I pray that it goes away
1	I think this may be a case on my hands because after speaking to this doctor I want to get my stitches taken out somewhere else or he owes me a great apology
1	After my surgery I stay a night
1	They went in arthroscopically and then they cut a four inch cut to go in there and fix my knee cap
1	First of all I thought I was staying an extra night because I felt so much pain
1	And after I did n't get my dosage of pain medication the doctor seemed to be in a bad mood and came to me and said your leaving the hospital
1	And said ok well I thought they were keeping me here and you did n't give the order and they said only you could discharge me
1	He gave me a lecture saying he has done more extensive surgeries and they have n't really given him a fuss on pain medication as I have
1	Well if he is talking about total knee replacements well you know what they were probably over sixty when he did them
1	They have probably had a lot more things happen to them then
1	My pain tolerance is very low so I need something really high to make it go away
1	Anyway he knows about the mental meds I was on and got off of
1	And he said that the only reason I want these pain meds is to cover up my mental problems that still exist
1	He said I was drug seeking and that my knee was n't that serious to begin with
1	Seeing that I need my knee cap put back in place a ligaments reattached and cartilidge attached
1	And that I should n't be given morphine or whatever the hell else they were given me
1	I bursted into tears saying I am not drug seeking or addicted to drugs
1	I take them as they directed and do n't over use them
1	And I do n't use them to hide my mental issues
1	I was in considerable amount of pain then I felt like he deserved a slap in the face
1	I was really nervous because I started twitching and picking at my ear
1	He knows about my anxiety and
1	But that does n't mean he has to use it against me
1	He did give me seven days worth only of pain killers even though it will take over 6 weeks to heal fully and probably longer
1	I hope he is right that it goes away in a week
1	Although I 've spoken to a lot of people that have gotten ligaments only torn and they say they have had to take pain killers for a month which I hope is n't the case
1	I mean does he think I feel good on these things
1	I think he thinks I 'm one of those disabled bums that is drug seeking
1	He hates that I do n't have a job
1	After I left there I did n't even feel like I wanted to live because he humiliated me so bad
1	He also said that the crutches I was walking on could n't hold my weight and I was like what do you mean they have a 300 lb weight capacity and I 'm 200lbs
1	At that point I just wanted to get the hell out of there but you know I was just so down at that point I felt like I wanted to jump out of a window figuratively
1	I do n't act like a baby when I have pain
1	I just wanted to know should I sue this doctor
1	Or I mean just state a grievance against him
1	I mean what would you do in that situation
1	See this is why I hate shrinks or doctors that think they are when they are n't
1	They make me out to be a real mental patient
1	Well I hope you could give me a little advice on what to do
1	Then there is my mom who thinks he is kind of a jerk
1	I am not going to him again or I may file a law suit if I end up in the mental hospital for making me feel depressed
1	Its just I had to get this off my mind
1	When I met my 21 year my exboyfriend 3 years ago 2007 he claimed he had a borderline personality
1	He told me this on the heels of a girl named Tracey breaking up with him after a week because she thought he was creepy
1	I did n't know what that meant but I was not going to ask questions because I was dealing with depression and did n't like people asking me about it
1	Summer 2007 We started dating
1	But it always felt more like a friendship because he would seem to shy away from me at times and be depressed
1	I knew it was because of this girl Jessica he has had an obsession with since the 9th grade
1	A month and a half later I found out that she had tricked him into kissing her which I did n't hear about until a week later because I finally got him to stop ignoring me
1	He told that we hardly know each other and that he is a terrible person
1	That I do n't know how horrible he really is
1	This pulling me in and pushing me away went on for 2 years mixed in with a lot of drama
1	It was as if he would get comfortable and then get uncomfortable with me
1	When we were not together he would act like we were friends but come around looking for sex
1	I guess since we were each others firsts and I was the only person who would give it to him
1	I was stupid to fall for his affection over and over again
1	His excuses for pushing me away were that he was a bad person
1	We seriously dated for the first time after he graduated when he vowed to forget about Jessica
1	We dated seriously for the first time in September 2008Valentines day
1	Valentines day we were suppose to go out but he claimed he was sick
1	I did n't believe him
1	I found out that he had been talking to a girl he met online in October
1	I yelled at him for the first time I 've ever know him
1	All the other times I let him walk all over me
1	I told him he was a scum bag and seriously needed helpamong other things
1	He was hurt by my words
1	Not even a week later he was dating this girl
1	The same week he went to visit her
1	After the second visit he came over and cried telling me that he was so sorry
1	He started cuddling with me and we had sex
1	This went on for the whole 3 months he was dating her because apparently he was not over me yet
1	But he would not tell her what was gong on
1	He would be with me and each time I found she was in town I was crushed
1	Again I was stupid and believed that he would choose me
1	In June 2009 he got in a fight with one of our mutual friends and outed his secret while his girlfriend was in the room
1	He came to me balling his eyes out telling me how sorry he was and that he wanted to be with me the whole time
1	He should of never broke up with me
1	I fell for it and took him back
1	We were fine until November of 2009
1	When I asked if it was another girl he said no
1	He told me when things settled down we would get back together and that he was happy I was waiting for him
1	Thanksgiving passed and I did n't hear from him
1	During the first two weeks of December he would come over and never seem to want to leave
1	When he did he would be back 3 hours later
1	He loves me and we are going to be ok One night his girl from New York contacted me wanting my side of the story from what happened between us during the summer
1	We talked for 4 hours and here while he was telling me that he was happy I was waiting for him she was in town Thanksgiving weekend
1	The next morning we attacked him
1	He told me that she was a crazy lying   and if I wanted to believe her over him than fine
1	He told her that he had nothing to say
1	So he choose me but I was angry
1	I wanted to talk to him about this but when he came over I failed to say anything and took him back
1	I thought I had finally got him and did n't want to let him go
1	In May he got a new job after being unemployed for a while and then got a new car
1	He had been using my car up until this point
1	He started going out with his friends all day and all night , coming over to my house looking for sex and then going to sleep
1	I was upset that he was acting like I was not important anymore
1	All the while he was talking to Jessica again and I saw him leaving her flirting comments on Facebook that I did confront him about
1	I noticed him starting to push me away again
1	One night I was at a party and my friend told me that my boyfriend had been hanging around Pet smart hitting on Jessica who also works there
1	I was so hurt that I text him to tell him how I felt about it
1	He told me to find a new boyfriend because he was sick of fighting with me about stupid crap
1	He was punishing me for going behind his back and hitting on another girl
1	He came by a couple of days later to pick up his stuff
1	We talked for a while and decided that we were going to work on things and everything would be ok We were working on things for a couple of weeks or so
1	He would still hold my hand
1	One day he was flirting with me and telling me that after he went to the bar he would come over and cuddle with me
1	He was drunk when he came over but was telling me that he loved me and that I am still his best friend
1	I am one of the few people who will spend time with him
1	That I am awesome because I do things for him
1	The next day he thanked me for taking care of him and hoped that i was n't too much trouble
1	He was flirting me and everything
1	A few days passed and I did n't hear from him
1	He finally text me saying he is sorry but he is busy tonight and ca n't talk
1	I asked him if it was another girl and he said yes I am going on a date
1	That he has been doing a lot of soul searching over the past week and that he thinks it is best for us to date other people because we have tried so many times to make it work in the past and that it always ends up the same
1	I tired to talk to him about it some more but he said maybe some other time
1	Like it was no big deal that I was hurt and dealing with it was getting in the way of his life
1	How could he tell me that he loved me and I was his best friend , flirt with me and tell me we will work on things , and then go ahead and make a date with someone without regarding my feelings
1	I heard from him a couple of weeks later on Facebook
1	I asked him how he was doing and he told me that he is a   up
1	Then he signed off and the next day he deleted me from Facebook
1	Less than a week later he was in a new relationship
1	The same girl who dumped him in high school after one week because he was creepy
1	Its possible that she thinks he has matured since then but come on
1	They have dating for 3 weeks and I have not heard from him since he deleted me
1	Here is what I know about their 3 weeks relationship so far   He has been treating her like gold and they think each other is amazing , they already said that they love each other , they are with each other everyday , he thinks she is the best thing to ever happen to him
1	I do n't understand how he can treat her like gold and think so highly of her and treat me like crap for most of the 3 years we were together
1	I tried so hard to love him and take care of him
1	I did everything for him and he never appreciated any of it
1	I was there for him when he had breakdowns
1	Now he does n't want anything to do with me
1	Now I 'm alone and he has someone
1	I deserve it more than he does
1	Is it possible he has decided to change for her
1	There was a point where I thought my mom and I hand a good , solid relationship however , that is n't the case anymore
1	About a year and half ago , I left my house because of her
1	She physically attacked me That was n't the first time either
1	When I was younger , I 'd get pinned against walls , slapped in the face causing bloody lips , and items thrown at me
1	I 'm mean , what was I supposed to do during all those times
1	Every time I threatened to call the cops , she would take the phone , wave it in my direction , and say , Here 's the phone , I 'll dial the number
1	I started relying on selfmutilation to get me through still do sometimes
1	I do n't approve of my methods either
1	I know they were and are horrible , but it 's one way to release all the anger and pain To make matters worse , I have friends that do the same thing , and I coach them through it like I 'm not battling the same problem
1	There 's hypocrisy at its finest Anyways , I ca n't really distinguish what hurts the most
1	I really wish I could forget about all of my problems all together , but I ca n't
1	She does n't claim fault for any wrong doing in her life
1	If we did n't get along , it was always my fault
1	I 'm not a saint , but honestly , without sounding like I have a big head , I am any parents ideal child
1	My mom always knew where I was and who I was with
1	I did n't think that was too much for her to ask for either , but look where it got me
1	Admitting I came from an abusive home makes me sick to my stomach
1	I do n't think anyone I grew up with would believe me either
1	She sweet talks people to win them over and so she can get what she wants
1	I fade to the background because I 'm the child
1	I 'm the reason our family is broken
1	It 's always me , me , ME
1	It sickens me even more to admit I came from an abusive home because my sister is still in that home , and she is the most important person in the world to me
1	I do n't want her to go through the same thing I went through
1	My mom scares me , even after being out of the house for so long
1	I want to protect her , but I feel so helpless
1	There 's a lot of underlying truths that I do n't want her to be exposed to , but at the same time , she 's eventually going to figure them out
1	Here 's a perfect example of why I worry about the wellbeing of my sister Last year , during this time , she was dating some new guy she always claimed he was the reason I left the house , without even listening to me
1	Keep in mind , my mom did n't date anyone while I was growing up or when my sister was growing up
1	I was coming back from LA when I received a phone call on my layover
1	She told me she had heard that my mom 's boyfriend had used my sister 's cell phone to obtain little girl 's numbers
1	One in particular , my mom 's boyfriend texted and asked her to meet him at the park
1	Well , the girl 's dad saw the text , came to the house in which I had previously lived , and punched my mom 's boyfriends and broke his phone
1	I was livid when I heard this
1	I tried to do damage control , but once again , I felt helpless , and I did n't know if this was true or not
1	Are you kidding me
1	I am just at a dead end with my mom
1	I thought she was going to attack me again a few weeks ago
1	I try to avoid her , but there are certain situations in life where I need her for important info , anyways
1	She makes me cry my eyes out
1	I lose my hair because of her
1	Yes , I 'm blaming it ALL on her because she needs to own up to something for once in her life
1	If she 's gon na put her hands on me , call me names , and deem me a screw up , she can take fault because SHE raised me
1	Deep down I know I 'm not a screw up , but I ca n't help but to believe it After you grow up with the idea for so long , you start to believe it
1	The worst of it all , and I mean the WORST of it all is that I still love her
1	All of this nonsense goes down , and I still love her
1	I 'm not even sure I want to love her , but I do Because she 's my mom , and maybe that 's the only reason
1	I 'm not saying there was never any good in our relationship , but when the bad outweighs the good what is there to look forward to
1	I do n't even know if there is anything left to salvage with my mom
1	She says she 's done , maybe I should be too And mean it
1	About two weeks ago , I hit my upperright thigh at work off of a hard edge
1	My doctor said it 's a hematoma but if it grows in size or changes to come back in a month
1	Is it really just a hematoma , I do n't want to hinge on a false guess and end up in the hospital months from now with a doctor oh i guess it really was n't a hematoma , hope you like chemo
1	It took me 6 months to finally convince doctors to give me an ultrasound to check my gallbladder
1	7 months after my initial complaint that I thought I was having gallbladder attacks , I finally had it removed
1	the reason I brought that story up , is because if this supposed hematoma is n't that , I do n't really think waiting around , without doing anything about it , for months , is in my best interest
1	I just want to know how I can do to make them take me seriously and get this stuff done now , yesterday would've been nice , but now
1	As a person who has struggled with an eating disorder for years I know that only someone who has gone through the exact same struggle can understand it
1	Ever since I was a little girl , I 've always felt off and abnormal
1	Lately I 've been reading more and more about BPD and it seems to fit me like a glove
1	Of course I can not be diagnosed over a computer but it would be helpful to have some insight and advice , a feeling of Hey , I 've been there too
1	I 'm going to try to make this as short as I can while painting a sort of clear picture about myself
1	Lately I 've been feeling like I 'm losing it
1	I have had people tell me I am antisocial and people tell me that I am the complete opposite
1	I have had people tell me I have no selfesteem and I have had people tell me I 'm a confident girl
1	I 'm manipulative but I 've never been called that because I am that ' good
1	I will use people to get what I want
1	If a friend does something wrong , I will cut them out and believe they are not to be trusted until they do something good
1	If they do something good , I will open my heart up to them and make them my favourite person
1	I have a fear of abandonment and rejection and sometimes I will push people away to give myself some kind of power and control over the situation
1	I have left my fiance more than a few times
1	I have shop lifted and stopped because I got caught when I was 18
1	I have felt on top of the world , like I am God 's gift and I have felt like I am worth less than the gum under my shoes
1	Just the other day I thought my fiance was talking to his exwife even though is completely unrealistic
1	I can be happy for a few hours then one thing can set me off and I 'll be completely negative
1	Sometimes I 'll go weeks feeling ' high ' and then weeks feeling low
1	I can almost feel like I 'm on some kind of drug when I 'm happy
1	And then I can think about dying when I 'm low and how there 's nothing and no one to live for
1	I keep tabs on my fiance and he does n't know it because I believe he is up to something even when I do n't have any evidence to back it up
1	And I justify it to myself because I have a right to protect myself because no one is to be trusted
1	I like being the one making the difference but then I need to be taken care of too even though I do n't always show it
1	I ca n't ever remember anything happening to me but as a child I showed all the symptoms , peeing afraid to be alone
1	I remember being 4 and telling my mom i was too sick to attend church so i could hide behind the couch and masterbate
1	I stuck things in my ears bc it aroused me as a childstrange i know
1	I played with my barbies in a sexual way
1	I still to this day get a feeling of wanting to jump out of my skin , creeped out feeling on sundays or when i am pregnant
1	I have been in therapy and she kind of alluded to my brother being the culprit
1	I do n't even know if I want to remember since if it did happen i am blocking it for a reason
1	But i would like to be able to pin point as to why I am the way I am now , not wanting sex with my husband but wanting to strip for strangers
1	Whenever I try to describe the way i feel on Sunday people think I am strange and I do n't know if it is just me or a sign of being abused
1	I received an email from my brotherinlaw that we have not heard from in years because of his threats and bizzarr beBurgess sent you a message on Facebook Chris sent you a message
1	I just BET you said   OH gee everybody , look , LOOK
1	and everybody just dropped everything they were doing and gave a collective HELLOOOOO
1	If I ever see you UCKS in my life , it 'll be too soonthanks much for the kind response
1	how is the affair going with oh I do n't know , you 've got to be screwing somebody since Peanut 's back has been out for years
1	Is that what we see taking its toll so very heavy as we view your pictures
1	Thanks again so much for the collective hello from your family to mine
1	Is n't it you that always said I 'm just not myself
1	well Jackie poo poo , here is all of myself for you and your loved ones to see
1	I am attaching it to see if you can diagnose the issue by reading such a bizarre letter
1	Please tell me if you think my family could possibly be in danger
1	He has made threats to my husbands parents
1	We have never started a fight or said anything to him ever that would trigger this
1	He also has left very bizarre messages on our answering machine about following his father   having pictures etc
1	and he speaks in a very monotone voice when he leaves these types of messages
1	I 'm scared for my family and do n't know what to do
1	He lives on the west coast and we live on the east coast
1	The distance makes me feel better but i still worry about my husbands parents that live within four hours of him
1	I know someone who 's father committed murder   suicide with his son
1	When i was younger i fondled with another male because i was curious
1	So Sunday my friends and I were watching the game and they decided it would be a good time for them to prank me
1	So my best friend texted me pretending to be a quote on quote girl that i have met 2 weeks ago at a bar
1	I kept asking who it was and was n't too sure but also was in fear that it would be the same male that i messed around with
1	Thinking that it was who i thought it was i texted this mysterious number back I just figured out who you were Anthony look i understand why your texting me but i ca nt man i have a girlfriend and i m done with that life style i really appreciate you not bothering me but i 'm really trying to change my life around so then my friend pulled me aside away from everyone else and said it was him fooling around and what was that text about
1	Pretty much he suspects i m gay but i m not i m def neterosexual and this was a really embarrassing and awkward moment
1	I 've been getting chest pains for some time , but have been checked out twice in AE to be told I have an almost athletic heart
1	The pains coincided with news of job redundancy , which was shortly followed by moving in to our first bought home , so whilst these things combined were stressful experiences , I brushed it off
1	I managed to find a new role , which I begun in January , but have been finding things extremely difficult , much more than I should
1	I then attempted to tackle my fear of flying , which was followed a few days later by two flights
1	The tightness in my chest has been becoming increasingly frequent , and my ability to do relatively straightforward tasks at work , progressively more difficult
1	I 've begun to suspect the pains are anxiety related , and that I may even be suffering from PTS , brought on largely by the events pre Christmas , but further aggravated by my new role which is relatively challenging and other things like my flying experiences
1	I know i have good thing on my head a good wave but life is so much complex
1	No matter whatever i can be the main thing is i must be mental time after time
1	I can be the chef but i was happy at kitchen where i used to go mad time after time for 2 days
1	If i wo nt get mad machine will make me mad at any place
1	And that increase my nervous ness and i became little bit slow on work but I try to come down inside cause i am known
1	when i do sex only i found blood pressure high , heart attack , then spontanous , when i do masturbate i got nervous at work , hard to do simple thing though i am confident , I have humour and experience either
1	But there is only one gain that I do n't have to do heart lungs and kidney operation again and again in old age becaue i die everyday
1	If i can not go mad time after time , the technology will bring lots of problem which makes me mad and happens relation bad , unstable
1	The two day kitchen hand job was good where i used to get communicate with machine and get mad
1	Whenever i get mad that day i can wake up early in the morning and feel fresh
1	Nowadays i am not getting mad thus i feel hard to wake up , I do n't know how to do psychic exercise safely and mantain everything
1	Next experiement , medicine try to reduce madness though it can not erase the madness but if madness didnot happen i haveto reduce medicine then i will go mad any how because i start to get extra thoughts by machine
1	I want to do psysic exercise at least 2 days a week but in a safe way and in a exact 2 days
1	I used to wake up in the morning and feel really angry at my wife because we had a lot of arguments
1	I guess somehow I ended up cracking one night after a heated argument and called her a   screaming from my lungs after being married 5 years
1	For over a 3 months , I woke up in the morning feeling very angry and thoughts of anger would rush into my mind
1	I need to leave her otherwise I will end up killing her
1	I ended up telling my family about my thoughts and I told them I needed to get a divorce otherwise I might do something stupid someday when we argue
1	I do n't wake up in the morning thinking about her anymore or calling her a , but now it seems to be my family
1	I live with my parents and sister
1	I now wake up in the morning angry at them
1	I sleep fine , but the moment I wake up , I think of really angry thoughts
1	I 've been to a psychologist , but he wanted to put me on drugs
1	I said I want a natural way and not have to rely on drugs
1	I need a friend to share the pain with and to try fixing our depressions togetherI've been depressed for 5 months now , I was very suicidal and therefore hospitalized in February for 6 weeks , which improved my condition a bit , but after that there has n't been any improvement , but instead I usually feel worse again especially my stomach problems , even though I have a psychiatrist who gives me medicine , and psychotherapist which I talk to once a week , and love and support from my family and friends although few of them understand what I 'm really going throughI started feeling hopeless and suicidal again but then I found a program for which it is said to have helped people even in the most extreme depressions , so I started reading it and will try the exercises from itso if anyone else has the similar situation , and would like to simultaneously try these exercises , text me , I 'd really appreciate work together , privae message daily and give support to each other because I think it would be much more effective that way
1	I am a 21 year old male
1	I have in the past had one major depressive episode which lasted for approximately a year as well as several bouts of anxiety wich have continued for the last three years
1	Most of these fears are fears concerning both mental and physical diseases but are not limited to these subjects   i believed I had AIDs had erectile problems for some time and did n't think I was normal thought I was going to give my girlfriend sexualy transmitted disease of which I was n't at a great risk etc etc
1	These fears often consume me and no matter how hard I convince myself I can not stop these intrusive thoughts from playing with my mind
1	When I become anxious I think about the issue non stop
1	I have had several fears concerning acquiring sexualy transmitted diseases but the most scary one I have to say is a fear that I will develop am developing shiczohprenia
1	I have smoked very small amounts of cannabis approximately 15 times over a span of maybe 4 years
1	The main source of my fear is usualy the next day not when I have smoked
1	I believe I am still high even if I had the tiniest amount or that I will develop schizophrenia or that I am developing schizophernia
1	These fears subside within a day or two and I can continue with my normal life
1	Maybe a month ago I used a fair amount
1	I went home and went to sleep and woke maybe five hours later after I heard a voice in my head say hey
1	I was only very much semi concious at the time and put it down to hypnagogia as I fell asleep again only moments later
1	The next day I become quite paranoid that I was still high or was developing phycotic symptoms and was questioning everything around me as to whether it was reality or if I was having hallucinations
1	Once again these fears subsided after a day and I went on with my normal life
1	I also decided to discontinue use of cannabis as I had not enjoyed the occasional experience of it
1	Three weeks later I was in the car with a friend who smoked a joint
1	He had the window open and I did not feel at all high as a a result
1	But I went home that afternoon and studied schizophrenia and the chacnes of developing a phycosis if you have a family history out of curiosity
1	I instantly became worried that I would develop the illness
1	The fear evolved from thinking I could possibly develop the illness to the fear that I was developing the illness
1	No matter how hard I try to convince myself I do not have schizophrenia I can not shake the belief that I may be devloping it
1	I try to avoid reading about symptoms when I get like this because often these symptoms then become an imagined reality
1	I ca n't help myself though and will study the disease condition non stop until I know every detail
1	I have not had any halluciantions but it is easy to think I might of in such a state
1	Every minute of the day I am analysing the source of every sound to see if it is real or not and when in complete silence I really focus to see if I can hear any sounds around me
1	I do however random words or phrases pop into my head   i can usual put this down to a movie I have watched in the past few days or writing on a sign I have seen that day or watever
1	I think it may just be imagined as I only do this when I m thinking about the fear of having schizophrenia
1	I have no other exhibitions of paranoid thinking except for when I show my ID at a nightclub when I think the bouncer will think I am drunk even when I am sober which has been a fear for maybe 34 months
1	I am not reclusive in the slightest and I would rather by around people than by myself because I am scared to think about this stuff and do so more when I m by myself
1	I do not believe people hate me or are conspiring to get me
1	Am I just suffering extreme anxiety as I believe I probably am or has anything here set off schizophrenia alarm bells so to speak
1	I just hope I stop thinking about this stuff it is completely consuming me
1	Everything has been going along normally other thanI have been told by Endo I am Anemic but I hear lots of women with Hashimotos are
1	I know alot of women w my thyroid problem have PCOS and take met
1	About 4 days ago I seemed to to START what felt like an actual period
1	But I was awaken today by cramps , so it had nothing to do with physical activity
1	The Gyno I went to because I had began with terrible itching and burning and then the bleeding
1	Gave me Lotrisone and told me if the bleeding stopped in a normal amount of time it was probably just uneventful cycling
1	But if it did n't stop he wanted to do a biopsy for Cancer
1	He kind of scared me
1	He mentioned that they can try Progesterone to try to control the bleeding and if that helped then it was just perimenopause
1	So I went on my way and was very busy Peeling wall paper   painting my Mom 's house for 4 days that I did n't notice anything but just bleeding all the time just a little
1	So I call him at day 9 and ask for the hormones to try
1	He put me on Aygestin 5 mg I am on day 5 and what puzzles me is that I actually started to bleede worse and it 's not stopping
1	I hate to ask him questions because he is very impatient
1	I am , anemic already been bleeding for 9 days and I was having confusion and he was getting annoyed with me for not understanding the instructions , which by the way the Pharmacist got all messed up
1	Also told me that the Aygestin was ESTROGEN
1	All he wants is for me to get a biopsy and frankly I am , a little scared and would like to have some info that is possitive and that It may be some thing else
1	When I had my last child I had an amnio while the tech was doing the Ultrasound portions she said something about have I ever been told I had either fibercystic or she said Polycystic , I do n't recall because the other person promptly told her to be quiet and ussered her out of the room
1	That was the last I ever heard about this and I have wondered ever since
1	After delivery and ever since I have always felt like my Uterus has never gone back to it 's normal size
1	It feels as though I am , always 6 months pregnant
1	Is it possible that I am , having a period and that the Aygestin is not working because of the period
1	Sorry about all the questions , just a little freaked out here After I posted this on another folderits been 5 more days but I have had 2 of those wno bleeding
1	Or is this happening because of the Hormone he put me on
1	I have a voice in my head It tells me I 'm worthless Dead to the world Nothing Nobody A failure Selfish Bad A burden Ugly Guilty A poor excuse for a gfdaughtersister etc Everything is my fault I should kill myself I do n't deserve happiness , or I 'll get it if I doso and so I should hurt myself I should punish myself Nobody likes me Everyone thinks bad of me Everyone is judging me If I do n't do things it says then the big black cloud will get me , kill me , swallow me up and take over my body and ruin my life I should do bad things I should hide myself in case I am recognised as then noone will find me I should n't go outside People are following me I should n't talk , people will take me away or think bad of me or conspire against me Nobody loves me , people pretend to get things from me or they 're under cover trying to get me ' keep your friends close and your enemies closer ' Everyone will leave me I ca n't trust people , everyone is out to get me There is always someone trying to get into the house and attack me Someone I love is possessed by the black cloud and so I ca n't trust themit 's not really them they are possessed Threatens me with bees which it will release into my head if I do n't do a certain thing and they will sting my brain and kill me slowly Tells me that if I do n't do what it wants bad things will happen to my friends and family It 's always watching me and checking on me It leads a team of evil things that could come and get me as they are all possessed ie
1	I 'm always jumpy or think anyone behind me is following me and so walk really fast
1	The voice in my head shows me flashes of what it wantstries to manipulate and control me 247 eg
1	shows me a lot of blood , if I look anywhere it changes the image to something horrible , eg
1	a someone watching me behind it about to jump out and get me , a lake   a dead bodyand example of what I could be if I do n't do what it asks or An image of me dead in the lake and flashes of me walking into it and letting myself die as I 'll look beautiful and that 's what I should do
1	This is controlling my life and I keep seeing things everywhere noone else sees and then they disappear and I am SO paranoid someone is trying to get meI am always running and being distracted in public talks or just even when I am with my friends and I go against people I love thinking they are possessed
1	for a the past four or so years I 've been going between these downs
1	But now its 2 years later and i feel so sad and irritable
1	Now I do n't even try to do things that will stop me from being sad
1	I do n't go out with my friends anymore
1	I feel like I do n't matter to them and they kind of do n't matter to me
1	I only see my boyfriend
1	I 'm doing well in school but it does n't matter to me
1	My boyfriend is the only person who even knows that I 'm not as happy as I seem
1	But i know it really hurts him to see me even remotely upset
1	I feel so bad that I 'm hurting
1	But I 'm so used to lying about how I really feel and think that I ca n't actually get even hint that I need help
1	Deep down I feel that if i get helped i wo nt have anything that makes me different and I deserve to be sad although I do n't know why
1	I ca n't tell ANYONE how i really feel
1	I hate telling people how I really feel because I 've had some bad experiences with it
1	I never say it right and I do n't come off the way I want to
1	I just feel like i 'm so lost
1	I do n't even really know why I do anything anymore
1	I do n't know why I 'm writing this

1	As of right now , my most debilitating symptoms is my depression and fatigue problems
1	I just feel like there 's so much to do and I 'm so young
1	My husband thinks this thing called Ascension is happening on 12212012 and we all need to be prepared for it
1	He is making me watch youtube videos to prepare me for it so I can help teach the kids who are grown and no longer at home
1	We will all be able to read each others minds and we will be able to transform things with our minds
1	And we only have two months to prepare for this , when we should really have eight like he did
1	He says he was so depressed at first and wanted to shoot himself in the head , but started thinking , why am I here , and with all the time on his hands and drugs in his system he started searching youtube and he now believes he is here for a higher purpose
1	He says he has never been so happy in his life
1	He does do illegal drugs , not sure what he all does , but I know marijuana and maybe even meth
1	He believes he has already begun ascending and when it is complete he is going to just disappear
1	He wants to teach it all to me so I can convince the kids
1	He truly thinks he is protecting us
1	He even had me reading something he had highlighted in the bible and to text Roger his friend who also believes in this ascension , so Roger could tell me to believe what he has to say
1	He made me read from the bible about wisdom , he said it would help prepare me so that I could open my mind to what he wants to teach me
1	He claims there is going to be an earthquake on my birthday April 13 or soon after that and that 's when it 's all going to start and it 's only going to get worse from there
1	Also he says he saw an airplane flying over yesterday and it just disappeared from the sky , right before his eyes
1	He says the earth is going off its orbit and they are going to redo all the airport runways and gps systems , because they are all wrong because of this
1	He is also talking about awakening , whatever that is , but he is going to teach me all these things , so I can convince the kids to start preparing
1	He says that Canada , the US and South America are going to all become one country and we will have the same dollar
1	I ca n't even laugh about this anymore because he really believes it is happening , that it has already started
1	He claims we are not allowed to have gardens or collect rain water
1	He also said that in a few months some very bad people will come looking for him to do him harm , because of all this stuff he is spreading around
1	They do n't like it and they do n't want us to know about what is happening , not quite sure if he is talking about the governments or the aliens , maybe both
1	He also believes that the US is owned by Britain and that we are all just tenants in our homes , because that 's what it says on the deed to our house
1	He is also talking about some drilling that is going on in Alabama and all the states around there , some fault line , ca n't remember what he called it , they are tunneling under these states and also evacuating them , so they can stop this volcano that is under there from erupting
1	When China or what ever country it was that had that massive earthquake last summer he claims HARP is responsible and there were over 200 major earthquakes that same day
1	He 's got me so paranoid I jump at every little thing
1	Plus he starts to get agitated when I do n't want to see any of it
1	He claims he wo n't hurt me , but after a text message I saw that he sent to Roger , I 'm not quite sure what to make of it
1	It said and I quote ya and if I ca n't figure out a way to get the   old lady to start gettin on the same page she gon na have some pain i m just worried about the grnd kid man and friends
1	What should I think of that , is he going to hurt me if I do n't start believing , or is he worried about what will happen if I do n't
1	This is just a small sample of what he has been saying to me
1	What do I do , how do I get help for him
1	This all started after he had surgery on his neck
1	I did not realize how much he believed this is happening until today when he kept telling me he wants to help me and the rest of the family
1	I am at my wits end and not sure where to turn or who I should talk to
1	Could you please advise me on what my first , step would be
1	Let me started by saying my doctor and family have been arguing for years about what is wrong with me mentally
1	Since I was young I been diagnoised with learning disabilities and some minor OCD which got worst two years ago but I 'll explain that after
1	I have a lot of problems that I can state
1	I cry a LOT
1	But I can also have a temper which has gotten worst over the years
1	Thanks to what 's happened to me in the past with old friend abandoning me I 've become extremely paranoid thinking people will leave me left and right
1	With my EX I became manipulative and controlling because I feared he would leave me
1	When he wanted to leave twice I got clingy and begged for him
1	But at times I think it 's the best option for me
1	With my OCD I have purely obsessional
1	I had thoughts that confused whether I loved my EX or not and those thoughts caused me major anxiety
1	I use to say I love him to I hate him so quickly it scared me
1	But nothing has scared me more till recently when I felt as if a switch had gone off in my head
1	Everything I thought I was all my life is suddenly gone
1	I 've been an animal activist and lover for years to the point that I would do anything for animals
1	I 've loved them more than people and would never hurt one
1	Now I feel indifferent about them
1	I worry what would happen if my pets died
1	Even though weeks before I had thoughts of what would happen if I had to put them down because of how old they 're getting and having problems
1	I bawled my eyes out
1	I would get violent images in my head of killing people who have hurt me
1	But I know I 'd never act on it
1	When I got angry I 'd yell , I 'd accused , I 'd blame , I 'd lie
1	But the only person I 'd hurt would be me
1	I 'd dig my nails into my skin , or claw my skin
1	I 'd threaten my life
1	I 'd say I was useless and did n't deserve to live
1	In the past I always questioned if something was wrong with me
1	When my grandmother called me a sociopath it 's like a switch went off in my head
1	I ca n't say they 're cute
1	I ca n't gush over them
1	Even though for a year I been overly excited for the panda 's coming to Canada so I could see my first panda in person
1	I went to cut something out of my cats fur that got stuck
1	And I got the image of cutting his neck and I felt this high batch of anxiety
1	When my friends were upset I recognize it and I comfort them
1	But I do n't feel like me anymore
1	They say sociopaths do n't care who they are
1	Me I 'm not sure
1	When I watch sad things I ca n't cry like I use too
1	When I watched something like the hunger games I thought I 'd cry but I did n't and I thought I felt myself smiling at the violence
1	My brother got hurt and I did n't seem to care
1	I 'm crying right now because I 'm scared
1	I was on bupropion hcl xl 450mgwellbutrin for almost 10 years
1	Several months ago a psychaitrist added Venlafaxineeffexor to my daily regimine
1	He started with a low dosage375 mg I think and worked me up to 150 mg a day over a period of about 3 months
1	I can honestly say in regards to my mental health I have never felt better in my life
1	I have not gone manic and I am definately not depressed anymore
1	Freinds and family have noticed a marked difference in my affect , my job performance has improved and perhaps best of all I can actually feel and see several differences myself
1	I have tried several medicationsover many years for my depression and nothing else has come close to working so well for me
1	Perhaps 5 months after starting Venlafaxine I started to experience some physical symptoms
1	It could start almost anywhere on my body and then it would start to spread until I was feeling intense itching sensations from head to toe
1	But let me tell you it is a very uncomfortable period
1	The next thing I noticed was that I seemed to have become alergic to water
1	Whether I am just washing my face or taking a shower whatever part of me that gets wet begins to get the same severe itch as I have already described , again with no visible symptoms
1	Another symptom that started to occur perhaps 34 weeks after the itching is a problem with the inside of my mouth
1	I also get strange tastes in my mouth
1	Another symptom is that I think I am salivating more than I normally would although this is hard to gage
1	If so , what can you tell me about them
1	By the way , I am not including any info about how I have approached my condition ie
1	doctor 's , psychiatrists , personal research because I thought my posting was already too long
1	Thank you ahead of time for any help or suggestions you can offer
1	When i was 14 years old my mother went away to finish her masters degree but i was living with my grandmother
1	I am an only child so at that stage i was in the 9th grade
1	I never had any one to guide me and tell me what s right
1	I started to secretly date this 16 year old guy that was in the 11th grade
1	he asked me for sex but i said no because i was afraid and at the time i was still a virgin
1	However he forced me into doing it
1	I went home afterwards and cried because i felt like a
1	My vagina was burning me when i went home and it looked kinda red
1	About a year after i looked at my vagina one day and realized it looked weird because some little bumps were growing in clusters on the labia lips of your vagina
1	I showed my mother and she took me to the doctor
1	I lied to her that i had never had sex before because i did nt want her to hurt me
1	Anyways the doctor took a look at it and told me i had HPV gential warts i cried so badly and my mother found out i was not a virgin
1	I felt depressed that i contracted that STD and i wish i could go bk and change the past because now i am so ashamed and have suffered from depression ever since
1	I am planning on removing the warts in easter of 2016 because i am now 19 years old
1	I told my present bf about what happened and he has stayed with me and comforted me and we have been dating for 3 years now
1	I worry about myself so much and my chances of cervical cancer smh i am crying typing this message because my life is messed up
1	I have contracted a yeast infection since week due to an antibiotic i was taking and the itch and burn is terrible
1	I got monistat for it tho but i am ashamed and afraid to go to a gynecologist
1	Iwant to be able to have children but am afraid because i do nt want them to contract my warts
1	I 've been treated w various antidepressnts since 2000 they all work awhile then not
1	I 've learned in past year I am severely ADHD adderall is a God send
1	But I think it messes up my visionyou also
1	I assume my current antidepressant Vibryd is no longer as effective after less than a year as creeping in depression is now such that I 'm crying and empty feeling despair in morns before adderall
1	I 've always been neg for thyroid but suspected for years
1	I 've unfort taken klonopin for years   low dose at night
1	And I think I could also be entering peri menopause
1	I had my gallbladder out and I do believe the after affects of anesthetic cause for moodiness too
1	I am a 28 year old , 7 month postpartum , breastfeeding mom
1	My 7 month old daughter is approx
1	I have to carry her up and down the stairs numerous times throughout the day for naps and bedtime , and do pick her up off the floor and carry her during the day
1	I have been very stressed and anxious dealing with her
1	Well about 3 or 4 months ago I began dealing with lower back pain and hip pain which I originally attributed to the return of AF after giving birth
1	I also began to experience some traveling sharp shooting pains that I would feel in my arm , my feet and even groin area
1	I have had one or two episodes of tingling in my elbow and down to my hands
1	I feel like part of it may be stress due to dealing with an extra fussy baby along with a 3 year old , and part of it having such a big baby to carry around
1	Thank you for this forum cause I really feel alone
1	I am married now with my high school sweetheart of 12 years and am gong through a divorce I filed because on December 23 , 2012 I received the worst phone call no wife ever want to get
1	The women you spoke with before and knew you and your spouse were married with 3 kids and tells me she is expecting a child with my husband
1	My world came crashing down … As far as I knew I was deeply in love with him , I love you texts and phone calls still existed and so did intimacy
1	I did n't see this news coming … it 's like when I 'm awake I 'm living a nightmare and when I sleep it 's the only time my heart rests from this immense emotional pain
1	My husband 's family never liked me throughout our whole marriage and recently reached out to that other women and invited her to their home
1	Since my world turned upside down they have not once reached out to me and my children … I 'm devastated … My husband finally opened his eyes and has begged for forgiveness but my heart is just to broken … I ca n't trust him again
1	Father please forgive my inlaws and husband , for they do not know what they are doing …
1	Father , i 'm just waiting for my healing , my heart desperately needs … I pray for all the broken families , spouses …
1	Ok so this is going to be a bit of a long story but I believe that the whole story must be explained so hopefully someone can help me
1	I am 26 years old
1	I 've been married for 5 years but have been with my husband for a total of 14 years
1	I was pregnant for our son at age 14 and had him at 15
1	When I was young I used to do everything for him
1	I never wanted him to leave me all alone to be a single teen mother so I always kept peace
1	So as time went on we kinda both grew up and things were good for the most part up until about 4 years ago
1	I started to realize that my husband was taking lortabs , xanex , and drinking prescribed cough meds
1	When I had my second child I was a prescription of pain medication because everyone gets them after having a baby
1	Well my meds disappeared I was left with one in the bottle
1	When I asked him about it he swore that it was n't him and that it was either my sister or brother who did it and I believed him until he later confessed
1	So naturally I forgave him but time and time again I kept on catching him
1	When I eventually started making him leave the house he got suicidal
1	So there I was again helping him get the help he needed and letting him come home
1	He just goes outside all day and drinks till he ca nt go anymore late at night
1	When I try to tell him he drank enough he goes into these rages
1	He calls me every curse word in the book
1	Another thing is that he does n't like our 11 year old son
1	He wanted me to have an abortion but I refused so its like he resents his own son
1	He never really pays him any attention but god forvive if our son is being bad he surely knows how to scream at him
1	he never does any father and son things with him
1	So now i m going to explain what has happened over the last 2 weeks
1	To start off I had enough of my husbands distructive behavior so I got myself a lawyer and started the divorce process
1	Well I let him kinda move back in but I kept paying my lawyer knowing that he would soon mess up again then I would continue without any problems
1	I had to confess to my lawyer that I had in fact let him move back in but I had already made him leave again
1	So the reason I made him leave was because the divorce papers came in the mail and I freaked because things were in fact going well but I needed to let him know the divorce had been filed but I did nt know it was filed
1	I guess it was my fault because I did nt tell my lawyer not to file but i did nt tell him to file either
1	So anyway I hoped that my husband would have sat there with me and we would have figured out what to do
1	But he lost his mind saying that I new it had been filed and that he was leaving
1	  you is what he said
1	So I told him if he wanted to leave he could but he needed to leave me money for groceries instead of throwing it in a bar and he said that I was never going to get a fing penny from him , he was nt coming to court and that he would rather rot in jail before paying child support
1	So I hid his phone from him and said he was nt getting it back until he left money for food
1	Well he grabbed me by the shirt and tried to pull me across the livingroom table , he picked up and candle holder and hent to hit me with it so I jerked back really hard I flew back in the kids who were sitting on the sofa because he woke them up
1	I kicked him away from me and called the cops but he left before they got to my house
1	After a couple of days he started to call to come visit the kids so I let him
1	Of course he was so sorry but I told him he needed to get counseling before he could come back
1	His response was that counseling was a crock and a waste of money and he was nt going
1	So this past weekend he came visit and I could nt help myself , I went in his truck and honestly I was looking around and I found lortab pills
1	He wanted to stay and when I said no and confrunted him with the pills he went into a rage
1	He chased me around the kitchen , I threw the pills in the sink and turned the water on so they disolved
1	I m telling you at that moment I had a close incounter with the devil
1	He went outside and started punching my car windows and cursing me out
1	My son walked outside and started screaming for him to leave me alone and to just go
1	He then told our son   you , your a ugly lil , i hate you
1	That was the icing on the cake because i was left to pick up the pieces of my sons broken heart
1	He cried for 3 days
1	Yesterday he showed up and have our son a hug , he was crying and saying how sorry he was
1	Now he wants me to give him yet another chance
1	Grant it i love him very much but i need to tie my heart and continue the divorce but i m so confused because now he wans to stop drinking , and go to church
1	But I think he is just bluffing but what if he wants to change
1	He always breaks his promises after he is allowed back home
1	Just when I think things are good I find myself in the same situation
1	How do I get rid of my fear of having schizophrenia
1	Hi , I have ocd and intrusive thoughts and depersonalization and derealization   I also believe I have anxiety but I 'm not sure
1	Anyways I was in the bathroom and I could swear
1	I heard my mom talking to my sister on the phone   there is a lot with my sister going on rn btw I even heard her say my sisters name
1	This sounded like she was actually talking to my sister
1	I used to have a fear of being schizophrenic but that has warn off , but now I have a fear of havinf dilutions And as soon as my mom swore that she did n't say anything moments ago and did n't hear anyone else I looked it up and
1	Now I 'm even more scared   What do I do
1	Idk what to do anymore My mom looked at me like I was crazy
1	UPDATE I doubt what I see and hear
1	I do n't know what is real   or I will be laying down kinda drifting off to sleep and I will keep worrying about this and I will get a thought like a whisper saying Marko And I do nt know
1	I just kinda shrugged it off as me being paranoid
1	I 'm tired of living my life in fear
1	I feel like I 'm seeing or hearing things
1	I also have taken a few quizzes and they said that I 'm likely to NOT have it
1	This is something I posted on Yahoo Answers , but I wanted serious , proffessional opinions
1	It is quite long as I struggle to explain , so bear with me A few years ago , I was a tough guy
1	Trained 4 hours a day , did Muay Thai , go into quite a number of fights when I was younger , got shot at and shot back at people , rough existence
1	I was never scared of anyone or anything , although I regret that part of my life , I 've come to accept the fact I was a different and mean person back then
1	Then , when I had my kids , I changed drastically
1	Yet , for the past like , 34 weeks , I , ve started DRASTICALLY changing for reasons I do n't know
1	I feel like I 'm slipping into insanity , for lack of a better explanation
1	I watched about 4 months ago , by almost random accident , a compilation of plane crashes
1	Since then , for an absolutely unknown reason , I ca n't sleep at night
1	We hear planes over our heads every 30 mins or so
1	I 've started developing a paralysing , almost irrational fear of one crashing and killing me and my kids
1	I do n't know where this came from , but my heart starts beating so bad I feel like I 'm having a heart attack
1	I 've never had these before and I have a LOT of trouble controlling it , a guy who used to pride himself on his selfcontrol Second , tornados
1	We had some storms recently and the same type of fear as the above keeps me awake whenever it rains
1	I spent about 4 hours yesterday with my head spinning and almost grabbing my baseball bat and kill the whole lot of them
1	A few years ago I would n't even have hesitated
1	But I fear them
1	I even fear calling the cops because they have a police scanner and I fear them trying to kill my kids
1	So my question is , what the hell is wrong with me
1	Why am I suddenly afraid of everything and can Ido anything to stop it
1	I really feel like my heart will blow up every time and it leaves me with HUGE headaches afterwards Reading the last bit makes me look a lil bit out of my mind LOL
1	Only thing makes me mad is the neighboors , but the problem I have I want solve is these inexplicable panic attacks of fear I 've never had before
1	And when I mean crippling , I mean it prevents me from doing activities I used to do
1	Sometimes I 'll be walking down the street and hear a plane and DUCK on a sidewalks because I feel it 's coming down too low
1	My kids laugh at me and I laugh with them , butthis is n't me
1	Do n't worry , I wo n't kill my neighbhors
1	I wanted to beat them up bad , but like I saidI'm getting afraid for no reason
1	I actually feel like my head is going to burst when it happens
1	I went numerous times at the hospital because I started developing trouble breathing probably because of smoking all at once , especially in the mornings
1	They disagree on asthma , they disagree on everything
1	So no medication and I endure even though I cough so much in the morning I feel like I 'm going to choke to death
1	I also only have my kids every weekend out of 2 , so thank God , they do n't get to see the worst of these attacks Another ridiculous exampleI ca n't control it
1	Sometimes I do n't go out because I 'm afraidsomething will happen
1	I did n't go and buy more coffee yesterday because I was afraid to pass by my neighbhors home , afraid he 'd insult me like he does with the whole neighborhood except me as of now , me getting angry , trying to off that guy and then getting offed myself
1	I should also mentioned my neighbors are members of a notorious known gang of criminals in my city
1	But since it 's a known unknown fact they buy off the cops , whenever I call them , they do n't show up
1	I could focus them and fight
1	Sometimes I still get them , I get so ANGRY I could literally make a hole in the wall and go kill everyone in the appartement next door and laugh like Hell while doing it but then , not to mention the fact it 's a crime and it disgusts me even though sometimes I feel like I have no choice , all that hatred turns to fear in a second and leaves me shaking like a freaking leaf without strenght in my bones
1	Am I really going mental , do I have a mental problem
1	I do n't really know where to start , but i need help
1	I 'm going crazy and I 'm not me
1	i am 19 i do n't have a dad
1	when i got out of AIT Oct 27 , 2012 , my mom shot herself in front of me Oct 28 , 2012
1	She was my best friend
1	We were at a halloween party and i hate parties , I 've never been that kind of girl , so i had my boyfriend of 3 years pick me up so i would n't be a party pooper
1	we were never in a fight   never as in my whole life i never got to have a fight with my mom or anything , she just did it the second i told her he was coming to get me
1	Well , after that happened , i was trying really hard to stay strong , but then i found porn on my Fiances computer in Jan , 2013 , which he promised to me face , looking in my eyes and everything , that he would never look at and if he did that he would tell me
1	he told me he would n't do it anymore , so i finally forgave him
1	i found it again in March
1	and he said he did nt mean it last time , but he meant it this time , so i forgave him again
1	Well i just found it again and i told him that if i were to find it again that i would not be with him anymore , bc my heart is falling apart
1	i do n't know who i am , what i like to do , or who i can trust
1	my mom IS my best friend and i ca nt accept that she is gone
1	my self esteem is at an all time low and people tell me i m sexy and stuff , but if i was , why would he look at porn , especially when he knows i m hurting the worst , then lie to me about he
1	i love him so much and want him to want me as much as i want him , but he barely even notices me
1	i 'm so numb but i hurt so bad
1	since i found it i have been living an outer body experience
1	i wish i was strong enough to die so i could see my mom again
1	i miss her so much
1	i love my fiance , but now i m scared to marry him bc i do nt trust him at all but i am scared to be without him
1	i ve talked to him so much about it
1	i feel so ugly and so fat and like he does n't even want me
1	Hi My 22 year old daughter with mosaic down syndrome had a psychotic break last February and she ended up in the hospital for a months stay
1	My daughter was diagnosed with OCD at the age of 13 and was treated with paxil
1	Her paxil was increased to 40 mg last February and Respirdol was added to help with the psychosis
1	She was on 3 mg of Respirdol but we have decreased it to 2 mg under doctors care of course
1	She has gained approximately 100 pounds this year and is consumed with food
1	She was given a working diagnosis of Schizophrenia but I question this diagnosis
1	She does n't hear voices all the time only when she feels stressed
1	She also states she hears celebrity 's voices such as the Jonas Brothers , Ellen , Dr Phil etc encouraging her and ensuring her that she is fine
1	This happens very seldom now but when she was in the throws of her psychotic break this was an everyday occurrence
1	Her passion was to be an actress and I wonder if the realization that this is unlikely to happen has caused these celebrity voices
1	She lost two close friends when she was in high school and she believes that they came to her in her bedroom shortly after their death and told her everything would be fine and not to worry
1	This was long before the psychotic break happened but it affected her enough that she would not sleep in her room for a long time afterwards
1	She has told me in the past that she believes that spirits have tried to contact her but this terrifies her especially now since her break
1	She is not the same outgoing , fun loving , girl she used to be
1	She is like a zombie now , she moves in very slow motion and is uninterested in socializing , and gets little pleasure from day to day life
1	There were many factors I believe led to her psychotic break and I do n't believe she has had another one in this past year
1	She also has sleep apnea too and I am sure the weight gain has made it worse
1	My question to you is because of her downs syndrome , should she be looked at differently with regards to her medications and dosages
1	Perhaps her body does n't require the same as other peoples bodies do and perhaps there are meds out there that work better for people like my daughter
1	Hello , I 'm Julia and I 'm 15
1	My boyfriend and i have been scared for a month now
1	About a month ago or possibly more , we got pretty intimate and he ended up fingering me
1	We could n't recall if he had preejaculate on his finger , although most of what he could remember proved the concern wrong
1	Nevertheless , we were paranoid to the point of no sleep for three weeks in which I experienced no symptoms of early pregnancy
1	I usually get my period the 20 somethingth and we were overjoyed when my period came the 30 somethingth
1	That month i spent worry free , until approaching the starting date of my second period since the scare
1	There are no changes in my diet , not a lot of stress , sleep schedule or really anything that could make my period irregular
1	My period is never really irregular and is specific to even the time of night it comes
1	We have had other intimate times since then , but very rarely since we do not see each other often
1	We were also always very careful when we did as in washing are hands even though no actual semen or preejaculate was clearly on his fingers , so that i do n't think there is any way i could get pregnant
1	I have had one hour or less of lower back pain , extremely mild cramping for 5 minutes , maybe 3 or 4 days ago i got mild breast soreness and it has n't fully gone away since
1	Just the breast part is scaring me a little , but I am not stressed enough for it to cause a late period
1	I have no way of getting a pregnancy test without my parents knowing , and I do n't want to scare my boyfriend for asking if he can get one for me
1	I 've seen a school councilor about the first huge scare which helped but i 'm tired of constantly living in wonder and fear
1	The lateness of my period with no cramps and these nonstop sore breasts are scaring me
1	I 'm 17 and I 've been really paranoid about cancer ever since I can remember
1	I 'm very afraid of getting it , and sometimes I feel desperate about it
1	I usually feel just fine , but there are sometimes like twice a year or so when I get REALLY paranoid and I convince myself that I suffer from cancer
1	I 'm very afraid to go to the doctor because I fear what I might say
1	Most of the times my parents get SO SICK of me being all depressed and worried that they force me into going to the doctor
1	I never got any exam done , but doctors always say that it 's nothing and I 'm just a paranoid child
1	Once I thought I had skin cancer due to a little pimple in my harm
1	I also felt my skin burning when I touched it , and I felt tiredeventually those symptoms and the pimple passed and I forgot about it
1	But every time something strange happens to me , or I feel a bit down or see something on the news about cancer , or hear about someone suffering from it , I get one of those episodes
1	Sometimes I convince myself I have brain cancer that 's the one that scares me the most and eye cancer
1	Anyway , in my mind , I have had almost every type of cancer
1	Like , I sometimes get these weird headaches in different parts of my head , I also feel a weird sensation in my vision and I get very obsessed about it
1	Spend my days just thinking about it , without a rest
1	I get REALLY sick of these thoughts , and I just cry , exhausted
1	Deep inside I know I 'm just making up symptoms but I also fear that it ai n't just my imaginationsomething might really be there
1	My father also suffers from this carcerophobia and he gets very depressed easily
1	Since he was a kid he was also convinced that he had a brain tumor until a few years , when he finally did several exams
1	He got better since then , but sometimes he still gets paranoid and depressed
1	I think I got that from him
1	He also felt weird symptoms like his head was pumping out , awkward visions , dizziness , etc
1	Anyway , I 'm really getting full of these thoughts and I 'm going crazy
1	Now I 'm terrified that I might have brain cancer
1	Because the boyfriend of a friend of mine discovered he has a stomach cancer and that made me remember my paranoia
1	I always know when I 'm gon na get this way
1	I sometimes feel dizzy , I have headaches , difficulties concentrating , weird vision and I feel terribly tired
1	But the stupid thing is , when I forget it , or when I concentrate on something else , this symptoms go away
1	Even so , I still think I might have something and I keep having nightmares about it
1	I ca n't control myself and I feel miserable
1	I 'm really terrified with that idea   I 've been to a shrink several times and I 've also been on antidepressants , psychologists , tried everything and still ca n't fix it
1	My parents yell at me constantly , even over stupid things
1	I ca n't do anything right and it makes me sad
1	They make me sad
1	I had a dream recently that my mom got really mad at me in a store and took me in the dressing room and hit me
1	I 'm scared they 're going to hit me even though they 've told me they 'd never do that My brother and sister never get yelled atmy sister is the favorite one because she went into music my parents are religious about music and my brother is the perfect one because he went into computer science and never does anything wrong
1	I do n't remember the last time anybody said anything bad about him
1	I really want to act , but my parents and sister are all how are you going to make a living off that
1	I do n't know , but least I 'll be out of this hellhole
1	I thought about being a vet , but my mom does n't think I could do it because I 'm too emotional
1	Then a few months later when I asked her what I should do she told me to be a vet
1	They yell at me for things and then they go do the exact same things
1	I hate being home when they 're around
1	I 'm a 40 , top of my class , and taught myself geometry last year cause the teacher does n't know crap
1	I wanted to kill myself from about November of last year to about April of this year
1	I tried to talk to my friends about it but all they did was change the subject and then talk about me behind my back
1	The only person who actually helped me was a guy I was crushing on but he ended up being a total jerk , so that 's over
1	I told my mom I was suicidal and she told me to get over it cause life is n't always fun I never want to be a mother because of her
1	I never want to become her and put my kids through hell
1	I believe it would be better if my kids stayed unborn
1	I have very low self esteem , I think I 'm stupid , worthless , and should just freakin die already cause I 'm wasting oxygen for the smart people
1	The only reason I have n't killed myself yet is because I was taught that if you kill yourself you 'll go to hell
1	I 've looked up that question and found yes 's and no 's so I really do n't want to take a chance and find out
1	I wish God would just end me already so I do n't have to feel like crap
1	All this stress about being the perfect kid and all the yelling at me makes me want to die
1	I wish I would've never been born
1	Part of me wants to hold on til I go to college , become successful , and then never see them again , just to show them up
1	I guess I 'm stuck here though anyway , thanks to my religion
1	It is Christmas , and I feel shxt
1	I am not very good with friends , as before always think it is a waste of time gathering and communicate with them
1	I am 31 , looking around , my friends are making positive progress , but myself , was feel like stepping at the same spot without progression
1	Without proper intervention , I am afraid I will commit suicide very soon
1	I 've been with my wife for ten years
1	I 've recently seen my drinking as a major catalyst and I 've stopped
1	it 's imperative that I stay calm , even when my wife screams at me
1	I 've made every effort to stay calm in the past when I 'm being yelled at but at times I 've snapped and gone into a rage
1	it 's never been physical as such , but I have scared myself and my family
1	I do n't know how to reverse us out of this situation now and I 'm genuinely scared of my reactions , even when I make every attempt to stay calm
1	I ca n't change her anger toward me , I can only change how I react
1	there have been times when the switch finally ' flicks ' when I say and do things I 've been helpless to prevent with adrenalin and in a ' fight or flight ' state
1	no man wishes for his wife to be fearful of him
1	I hope there is light at the end of the tunnel because leaving my family has never been and option to me , I want to support them and find calm and happy balance
1	What if all the bad stuff people say about bpd is true what if we are all liars , attention seekers , manipulative and agressive angry people who abuse everyone they meet , no wonder they do n't want to help us , who would , maybe its better they let us selfharm and be suicidal maybe that is their plan to get rid of us , just a though eh
1	Fed up reading all the attacks make on bpd yeah ok i am an agressive useless   who selfharms and is suicidal just to get attention , i abuse my partner and family and i am so imperfect and do nothing right which is why everyone hates me , now i bet everyone who reads this believes this of me because i have bpd but if i wrote i am a worthy human being who was raped repeatedly as a child and adult , still continuing to this day would that excuse my behaviour would that give me reason to selfharm and be suicidal
1	No one sees that though do they and no one knows , no one knows all those attempts are attempts to escape this not get   ATTENTION , what use will that do me
1	Hello I find it very disturbing that my 39 year old boyfriend sleeps with 9 year old daughter

1	I have asked several different people for their opinion they all agree with me when I discussed this with him he of course got extremely irrate and said he spoke to his coworker   a man and he told him he thought I was wrong and it perfectly normal and okay for him to sleep with the daughter
1	I am sure his coworker was nt told all the other stuff that I see
1	I do not know if it is better to stay with my functioning alcoholic husband or leave
1	When he is sober he is funny , and a great dad
1	But he is drunk 34 days a week
1	I have a lot of anxiety I believed is caused my unhappiness or depression in my marriage
1	I think I would be a lot happier without him but I do n't want my 2 kids to grow up without their father , especially my daughter
1	Then again , I do n't want them learning dependency from himcodependency from me
1	We have been married 10 years and most of that has been filled with conflict
1	We have weathered his 2 DUI 's , my cancer and severe health problems , two children , unemployment , everything
1	You would think that after almost losing me to cancer he would appreciate me some but he still blows me and the kids off , comes home , gets drunk , sleepwalks through life
1	I have caught him trying to cheat on me several times , once with my adult niece
1	He pressures me constantly to swing and we fight about this often
1	I make 2x as much money as him , pay all the bills because his   is for beer , gas , lunch money
1	I almost think I am very afraid of getting cancer again and being by myself my family offered me little support this last time
1	I also still love him and deep down do n't want to hurt him , I know it will devastate him
1	But he does n't change , blames me for everything
1	AA was ordered by the court for both his DUI 's and did n't help him
1	He says he is an alcoholic and laughs about it
1	AlAnon is not an option for me , because he would have to watch the kids and he wo n't
1	I know financially I can do it because I pay everything now , and when he was out of work for a year , but is it better for my kids to stay with their father
1	My parents have been married 50 years and I really wanted that , but so sad I do n't think it can hapen
1	I know ultimately the decision is mine but having trouble deciding if I can bear living with an alcoholic just to give my kids their father
1	everyone wants me to get out party and have fun fall in love and go on happily with my life
1	I have dizzy spells I break out in a cold sweat and it is so bad water runs down my neck and my face
1	I was with my best friend
1	she was looking for a card and I was looking foe a birthday party
1	I told her I felt funny
1	she said I was staring at her and I just fell gently to the floor
1	I got back up and said I really do n't feel good
1	I started to get up again and I felt a hand on my shoulder and he put me in a wheel chair , she said I passed out 3 times
1	she took me home and we never went shopping again
1	I love her she is a dear friend
1	I walk very far my legs ache and I get so tired I can hardly stand
1	far as being in love again never could I ever love anyone like my hubby
1	I will not betray him
1	right now I am sick my head is busting
1	I have had no food or drink all day
1	thanks for trying to make me young again but it just not me
1	My symptoms mild to extreme dizziness weird dull pain in right side of my brain always the same spot and the pain gets sharp with pressure such as sneezing , coughing , physical exertion or stress and tension fatigue during the day , difficulty sleeping or flatout insomnia during the night brain pain wakes me up at night and seems worse at night and in the morning occasional vision problems in right eye spots and shadows and such sensitivity to sound balance issues fuzzinessconfusionmemory difficulties esp
1	What has been done CT scan in April 2010 outcome normal , MRI in May 2010 outcome normalchange in white matter in right frontal lobe and that was explained to me as normal , and lumbar puncture in April 2010 outcome normal
1	I 'm a single mom , I just left my husband this month and have nowhere to go , no job was a stayhome mom for 6 years , no car , no money , etc
1	I am under an INSANE amount of stress
1	Not to mention all the other health issues I have been dealing with hypothyroid , prediabetes , PCOS
1	My primary doc just wants to put me on antideppressants which I 'm not okay with and my endocrinologist does n't think I NEED to do that the antidepressants yet
1	I saw another doc who says no to those meds also , but wants me to try some stronger headache meds
1	I had counselling today , I thought I 'd dealt with most things that would upset me , apparently notI do n't blame myself for the abuse anymore , I do n't feel guilty and I 'm moving on with my lifeToday in counselling I realised I still do n't have control , he is still there in my head , as far triggers , I still have a few , smells are the worst , people with moustaches , even some books , so now with my counsellor we are working on visualisation techniques to take the control back and put him out of my head and thoughtsI got upset today for the first time in agesThere 's got to be a light at the end of this tunnelAnd yes allmymarbles if you read this counselling can bring back memories and triggers I personally prefer to keep working with professionals who know what their doing , because although today was hard it was another weight lifted , I know eventually I 'll be fine with everything It 's just working through it , and no I 'm not on here for sympathy or pityI'm here to share with others that It 's not always easy going through counsellingYou have to put the effort in
1	I was homeless for about a year
1	I 'm in my 20s and I have had the diagnoses for about three years now
1	I am not much of a talker and i have a hard time trying to get my point across to people
1	Which because I am high functioning I find it difficult to live with those that are not the same
1	And I 'm trying to find a community where I can be safe , be myself , and not fill like I ca n't talk to those around me
1	I find I difficult to make friends in the facility that I 'm in now because we do n't see eye to eye on things
1	I 'm now in the process of finding me an apartment because i ca n't handle the stress living in a group home
1	I will be living on my own
1	This will be my first time ever living on my own
1	And because I 'm not a talker I 'm finding it difficult to make friends
1	What can I do to cope with living in a group home and prepare myself to live out on my own
1	I 'm fifteen and I think I 'm depressed
1	A lot of people if I told them that would think I was overreacting to feeling sad or upset , but I 've been depressed since seventh grade and I 've noticed the difference
1	Back then , I started getting upset a lot more than I used to , and when I got upset I felt a lot worse than usual
1	However , I rarely did itonly when I was really upsetand besides that , I was pretty normal
1	I do n't mope around , and it 's not like I 'm never happy
1	But I get episodes where I get so upset I start crying so hard I ca n't breathe , I cut myself , I feel guilty about everything and start thinking about everything that 's wrong in my life , which only makes it worse
1	Normally , I just lock myself in my closet and let myself be upset until I 'm just too tired to even care
1	Sometimes I cut myself which helps me calm down
1	One time I got as far as checking the pills bottles in our house to see how many it would take for a fatal overdose , but then my grandma walked in a I just pretended I got a headache
1	It takes a lot to hold myself back from killing myself , but thinking about vary things can do the trick , like my best friend or the thought of no one ever reading my stories I 'm a writer
1	I have social issues where I ca n't talk to pretty much everyone except for a few people I 'm comfortable with , and even with them I have to try
1	It 's not like I do n't want to talk to people I just ca n't do it
1	I do n't have people I can talk to
1	I have considered telling my best friend , but I 'm afraid that it will either a freak him out and things will stop being the way they are between us or b he will tell someone even if I ask him not to and then things will stop being the way they are period
1	I ca n't tell anyone in my family
1	My stepdad would think I was doing it for attention and my mom would freak out and never let be alone again or handle sharp objects
1	I have next to no friends because I am incapable of talking to people , my sister is perfect to my parents she shoplifted and did n't get grounded , I used too much conditioner and got grounded for three weeks , I have bad issues with handing in homework and I 've realized I hate myself way more than can be healthy
1	Basically , I feel this way and it 's not going away like I thought it would
1	I 've realized that I need to actually do something to get better , but I do n't know what to do without telling someone and completely ruining the parts of my life that make me happy
1	I manage to get things done , but i feel like the day to day necessities are just too much to handle , laundry , cleaning , pretty much anything outside of going to work
1	I have no energy   will sleep as long as my husband lets me on the weekends
1	I feel like i m depriving my child of a fun mommy to play with
1	I feel terrible because i have nothing to be depressed about
1	I also think I had undiagnosed post partum depression which i never let anyone know about because i was ashamed
1	I did nt even realize i could be depressed until i started taking a drug called tramadol for pain
1	I used it a few times a week   noticed i felt much better with more energy and less mood swings
1	Now I 'm wondering if I should try St John 's wort or see a psychiatrist for an antidepressant
1	I have had 2 pm cortisol tests doneThe 1st one tha results where 217 ugdl and the second one from a different doctor six months later was 195 ugdlOn both lab result sheets they indicated that the results were out of range
1	The first doctor who was an Endo never even brought it up to meHe told me I was alrightI decided to retake the test with a different doctorThe results came back and even though they results indicated that the results were out of range195 ugdl   and he told me everything was okayFor almost 10 years I 've been suffering with very high anxiety and nervousnessAlso heat intolerance and excessive sweating no matter if its hot or coldI have n't got a diagnosis and all the tests i 've done have come back normalmy cortisol tests are the only ones that came back abnormal but the doctors never mentioned anythingDo those results indicate a problem or are the doctors i 've seen right
1	What evers causing me problems is having a domino effect on my health and i 'm suffering from digestion problems chest discomfort , incomplete bowel movements and body acne and when I sweat , eat anything or get anxious I get fecal body odorI need to know what to do cause my life is at a stand still cause its hard to do anything

1	My husband has a big anger problem , but he wo n't realize it
1	He get 's mad at me all the time , about everything I do
1	Everything I do or the way I think or see things is wrong
1	He wants me to be like him , think like him
1	When we talk about him fliping out again , he get 's mad again and tells me that I AM THE REASON he get 's mad
1	I try to avoid him or not to listen but he get 's really personal sometimes and says things , that he knows hurt me like , about my childhood
1	When I get emotional or cry , he gets even more mad
1	My oldest son , his stepson my son knows my husband since he is a baby
1	The only dad he knows is my husband well , I always knew that my husband loved him like his own son
1	But since we both had 2 more babies I feel like me and my oldest son are nothing but a bugaboo to him
1	My oldest son is a good kid but my husband always finds things to criticize him
1	He tells me you and your son are so a like I think totally different then you both
1	I am from a different country and my husband knows that I have nowhere to go
1	That 's the power he has over me
1	He said that , if we get a divorse he will make sure that my two youngest will stay with him
1	I 'm a stayathm mom so I have no money for a good lawyer
1	My husband had a rough childhood though , his mother was being physically abused by his father
1	Well , my husband is also telling me not to act like he 's beating me
1	I do n't know what to do , I want him to get help but he will not listen to me
1	How can I make him understand that he is destroying our family
1	Hello , I am sure a million and one fedup spouses ask this question but here I am yet again asking myself and all of you Do I stay or do I   go
1	I have been married for 10 years to what they call a functioning alcoholic
1	We have two children together , our son is 6 and our daughter is 5
1	My husband drank prior to our marriage so I was not blind getting into our marriage just a fool
1	Two weeks ago he struck me for the first time
1	chipped a tooth he has always called me every name in the book and threatened to knock me out but he did it , he hit me and the act of him hitting me hurt worse than the hit itself
1	I never believed that he would do it Before everyone goes on a tirade telling me to call the police and so on
1	I know now that I should have called the police , but I did n't so that ship has sailed
1	When I attempted to call the police that night my phone flew into the wall and I was terrified of him waking the kids up and them seeing any of this
1	I do not work and have not for 6 years since the birth of our son
1	That night is stuck in my head and no matter the amount of apologies I hear , I can not except them
1	I am not angry anymore , just need to find an out I think
1	We had two years of mirage counseling and he was dry for a whooping 5 months
1	I am tired , fed up , unemployed and terrified of what it means to actually send him packing
1	She was a single parent and I am now codependent on her as an adultI experienced Anorexia , depression and severe anxiety most of my life
1	I feel responsible for her pain and she wo nt be there for me through my own suffering , as she says I have put her through enoughHer
1	If she only knew how much I withhold information just to protect her She will only be there when I do as she says
1	I am ignored in my greatest times of distress and feel I need her to cope
1	She abandons me when I need her the most
1	I feel unworthy , unloved and she has made me believe she is the ONLY ONE I can rely on or if I do n't do what she says I am a failure
1	I feel like I am worth nothing
1	I am going through a lot at the moment and feel trapped , distraught and extremely guilty for upsetting her
1	I also feel unlovable as she has abandoned me once again when I need her the most
1	To day I feel like my bf is very deserving of the cold shoulder an a slap the he 's getting in my nerves sumin awful the day it 's little things like running down to the garage 10 mins after gettin up an staying down still late afternoon then only seeing him for dinner

1	I was just prescribed Zolft for anxiety and my doctor started me on the low dose of 50 mg but said I could start off with 25 mg the first few days to hopefully lessen side effects because he had originally prescribed me Citalopram but after the first dose the side effects were so bad I could barely function
1	Anyway , I took my first dose of Zoloft last night after dinner and aside from feeling a little queasy and fuzzy in the head it was n't too bad but then I had a horrible night
1	I could n't sleep well , I tossed and turned and felt nauseous all night
1	I still feel nauseous and I ca n't eat
1	I have a horrible headache and my head feels so cloudy
1	It makes me not want to take it anymore but I know I need help
1	I work fulltime as a bank teller and i have an extremely hard time working when I feel like this but I ca n't take off
1	I am a 19 year old male and for the past 7 months or so i have had headaches , dizziness , and jumpy vision
1	It all started one morning when i awoke with testicle pain in one testicle
1	The doctor thought that it could be an infection so he gave me some antibiotic
1	Ever since that day i have headaches
1	For the last month or two , i have been worrying 247 about the world and if the people around me are real life
1	I have trouble thinking how they live their life when they are not around me
1	I think about it so much that i almost vomit from worrying but i ca n't stop though
1	I have not heard any voices and my eyes are just jumpy and a little blurry at times but other than a little blurriness they are fineI twitch a little bit , i do n't know why
1	Please if you can post back quickly i really would like to hear what you think
1	I have a question about my brothers relationship
1	He met this woman about 3 months ago
1	She is recently divorced , She is a devout baptist and my brother is an agnostic , but with his BPD he becomes what she is , He now runs around saying he never said he did not believe in god and some other things that are a bit strange
1	I will give you an example of how he morphs into who he is around
1	He was around family friends and they were on the vol
1	he went on the VFD , then when he moved to Wichita he had a college buddie move into his spare bed , and becasue he went into the army he wanted to play army and almost went into the service
1	He has done this over and over again , one time when I built a couple of models , he went out and bought very high dollar air brush kit and other items that he never even used
1	I understand that BPD is the reason that he mirrors the people he is around , My question is I would bet my last   that he is only getting along with her becasuse he is hiding his real personality
1	How long before he can not hold back his out bursts and let the real person stand out
1	If he could hide it forever , it would be the first time in his life he would have done so
1	The strange thing is that this woman is 35 yo and she seems at this point in time be an enabler , When my brother moved down to Wichita from Michigan , I rented out his home and packed his stuff in to a shed I bought and dropped at his home , sold his home , and then rented a truck on my Credit card used my time to drive it down to him , then paid myself back with the sale of the home for my out of pocket
1	Now a couple years later I have heard him tell people it was hard moving my stuff down here , I remember renting the truck and driving that POS all the way down here I never once got a thank you
1	And I asked for one favor and when there was a bit of trouble he got all upset at me for a phone call he had to take about a missing package in the mail
1	He lived with my other brother in a 1 bed
1	apt and did not even look for work when he moved , His brother who lived in Michigan at the time had to do a fake break in to his home to get him insurance money to rent an apt
1	He finaly got a job at sherwinwilliams and now acts like he singlhandedly has saved the world because he went to night school to get his deg
1	He is either on the ground looking at his 45 and we have seen this in reality or he is acting like he is so superior to all the other ants and uneducated idiots his words of the world are so inferior to him
1	Can any one tell me how people with this BPD start to destroy their perfect relationship
1	We was going out for 1 year then , we was in love , but it all started when i moved to his house as he thought that he could controll me
1	He started hitting me everyday he was hitting me harder and harder and care less and make me cry but tell me to shut up and stop crying and carried on hitting meI had enough then so i run away and he was ringing me up everyday to take him back , and i was stupid enough to believe him that he 's going to change
1	So i took him back and he said if he   it up again i can leave him but he did n't he knew that he   it up and started hitting me and not letting me go back homeafter couple days he asked me to take nude pictures of me and i said no , he made me and i was all in tears but he did n't care he said if i do n't do it he 's going to beat me and took them
1	After that i said i do n't want to be with him i want to leave and he said if i 'm going to leave him he 's going to put all of the pictures on facebook , online , and show to all of my friends and family and everyone that i know is going to laught at me so i could feel embarrasing and wanting to die etc
1	I do n't know what can I do to stop him or who do i tell or how to leave him
1	He controlls all my life , does n't let me do anything without his permission , like i ca n't laugh , cry , get up when i want , i have to do exactly what he says i have to do or he will beat me up , with remote controller , stick or hammer or anything that would hurt me alot , i already have loads of bruises and scars everywhere but mainly he hits my foot and toes
1	He does anything from punching my head in to punching or kicking my body , or elbowing my back or ribs
1	  Now i cry 247 sometimes when he sees me but sometimes when i am in my bedroom or bathroom and have bad times at college , i never smile now or talk , and all my friends are asking me if i am alright and what 's wrong with me
1	I ca n't do this anymore I want to leave him but i ca n't he keeps me in his house i have n't got key because of the last time , he says i will never have key anymore
1	He swears and clling me names at me everyday and expects me to be nice to him which i ca n't do because i do n't want to be with him so he makes me to be nice to him when he beats me up i already had black eyes 3 times and bleeding from my head and have n't seen my family because of that
1	he decides everything for me and when i can go out or when i can see my family
1	now i m his for over 2 years and he wants to keep me for his all life and have family with him and etc
1	  I try to communicate with him but all he ever does is changing subjects or does n’t want to solve problems and then pretends like nothing ever happened
1	he 's very aggressive towards me and I am trying to keep quite when he 's angry and swearing at me like calling names for example , slag,,,trump , thick , idiot , useless so i feel so down and i do n't have any selfesteem
1	  He tries to be nice to me but when he gets angry he blames everything on me that i have done it , but now i understand him more on why he 's been acting like that
1	He has ADHD   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , learning difficulties , behavioural difficulties , poor social skills , poor motor skills and he has Dyspraxia and other things that i can give you on request
1	I really want to help him , try to make this relationship work or i want to leave him , but i have tried many things , like thretahen him with police   retsrained order or with other things , but all he ever says that he will put my pictures up , he will beat my family up   they live like 3 min away , he would beat me to death or call his all family to do it for him , he refuses any help from others like go to anger mnagement or counsellor so he does n't want anyone help i tried other things that i can not remember
1	I really need this sorted out because I want to do so many things in life the biggest of them is my education that is important to me but not to him so he doens't cares so most of the times he does n't let me go to college or do my work but i want to go to University which he does n't want me to do that 's why he wants the baby now , but i want to have good job for myself aswell but i do n't think that I will ever have good life or social life with others
1	i have also tried killing myself like swallowing some anti deppressant tablets that was n't for me but i just found them   had big headache for 4 days , cutting my hand , wrists , not eating anything or drinkin water and beating my self up with the stick that he had been using on my feet or anywhere else and scratching my face and eyes till it bleeds , when he finds out what i have been doing he beats me up for it so i wudn't do it again and says that I am attention seeker when i say that i do n't want to live anymore because in what mess i am right now , nothing goes to plan or everything is going wrong
1	Any advice here or suggestions on how can i help him , or what can i do to help other than to shut up and listen to what he says
1	My parents are driving me crazy
1	They pick on little things I do and do n't let me do a lot or get out a lot
1	When I tell them this and I 've tried EVERY way they are able to make it sound ok and make me question myself
1	I 'm just starting to figure out how to be confident and my parents are messing that up too
1	My father recently taped an article about how bad sugar is in the sugar cabinet saying that it makes you fat old and ugly and to him it 's a joke but honestly it does n't feel that way especially since he believes it
1	I tell them they 're making me self conscious and I feel trapped and they tell me it 's in my head and I do n't even know anymore
1	I 've really learned to hide my emotions and sometimes I 'll just burst bc I ca n't always hold it in
1	I just wanna get out and be with my friends bc they make me feel sane but it 's so hard to even do that
1	My parents keep saying I have this great life and that I 'm being dramatic and then I just feel so selfish talking about this
1	I 'm trying to keep them out of my head but then I start questioning if I 'm wrong but everyone I know says I 'm not but no one knows how to help
1	Sometimes I feel absolutely nothing and sometimes I feel way too much
1	I am twenty one years old and recently found out my dad is a psychopath
1	The sad part is that i was very close to him as a child
1	He had the biggest heart and he cared about everybody in his life
1	He takes advantage of his parents , friends , and family
1	Everything revolves around him and only him
1	If a family member is sick he just thinks the world is out to get him
1	He is happy when his family is miserable
1	In the past couple of years his outward appearance has changed
1	He makes weird angry faces when he is thinking or talking to you
1	The only communication I have with him right now is through email
1	Even in his emails he takes every chance he has to talk about himself and how hard it is for him
1	All I get is fake sorry 's and I will never do it again
1	I just really miss my old dad but maybe I have to realize that this is who he is and move on
1	But she realized this a lot earlier then I did
1	When I ask her does he even love me anymore
1	She says he loves you in the only way he knows how
1	But I believe that these days he does not know how to love and I ca n't make him try and care if he does n't
1	So let me fill you in , I am a 18 year old male student doing my 5th year in highschool
1	I never made enough credits my freshmen through senior year because of learning disabilities revolved around anxiety and depression
1	I often missed school due to being hospitalized and day treatment programs for my self harm and depression and anxiety
1	I am trying my best to work at getting my highschool certificate but my mental health has been getting in the way
1	I have been seeing a therapist for 5 years now and have been prescribed multiple medications to help me cope
1	I work at job that is a passion of mine working with animals
1	But I am confused with my life as far as what is next for me
1	And even being in the workforce is a lot for me to handle even doing something that I absolutely love
1	I have an amazing support system family , long term girlfriend , friends but I just ca n't seem to swallow the idea of post highschool education or going to work full time
1	I feel as if I am trapped
1	Greetings , I have caught bacterial conjunctivitis three months ago , after rubbing my eyes for one week in a raw everyday for several hours i had itchy feeling , afterward a yellow thick discharge began to appear in the morning that made my eyes stick together
1	I went to a pharmacy , the guy there gave me tobradex eye drops , i used it for 2 days only , my symptoms immediately disappeared in the second day , however i discontinued using the antibiotic course thinking that it was cleared forever
1	Now i am having every 2 or 3 weeks an episode of bacterial conjunctivitis , that lasts for 3 to 4 days than disappear , the reason for its reappearance is probably because i constantly rub my eyes
1	I have the following questions 1I have read somewhere that i should have not discontinued tobradex even if the symptoms cleared , because the bacteria has not been fully killed , and therefore it is reappearing again whenever i rub my eyes , is it true
1	PS I am a man no makeup and i do not wear lenses
1	I Will say it was the best decision taken for me as a woman
1	Not to long ago On Feb 14th I took out my kids for a Valentine Dinner
1	My 15 n 10 yr old daughters asked bout the kinds of gifts their father used to give Me when married to him
1	I honestly saw no point to the questions non the less i answered them

1	Hi everyoneSo I began taking generic Wellbutrin 150 xl trend by the manufacture Par Pharm nine days ago
1	Until yesterday I had zero symptoms or side effects from the new med
1	The good news is since since starting Wellbutrin generic , I have not had one single headache or migraine what a relief
1	Bad news I woke up from my sleep last night with a burning sensation down my right thigh
1	On my shift today at work not only did the burning sensation of my right side continue my , kneecap became swollen and so did my ankle
1	My fingers also on my right hand are sore and weak
1	I work in the medical field w patients all day   i could not even bend , squat , or move a patient
1	My Doctor advised me to stop the Rx cold turkey after 9days but this is the first time in 3years I have lived without a headachemigraineand the depression from that
1	I can quite nervous over this unforeseen sideeffect that I have encountered and honestly , a bit bummed about what is happening
1	I am 15 now and have been going through depression for the last 5 years
1	From first i had no friends i was a very good student and got straight A 's
1	I had this positive spirit in me
1	I was just doing fine until i got mentally harassed by some girls at school
1	They first pretended to be my friends but their true intention was to torture me
1	They used to call me names And humiliate me
1	My mom neglected me at first
1	She had her own issues at work and with my dad
1	Everyday i sat and wondered if something was wrong with me that made all my fellow classmates hate me
1	Every single one of them hated me
1	If i went to maybe borrow something they would make those ignorant faces
1	I was always trying to act kind and helpful towards everyone but when i walked towards them they just walked away
1	They wo n't let me play with them and say ' go away we do nt need you '
1	At last when i told my mom she said to ignore them and just smile on what they say then they will leave you alone
1	I did what she said
1	I still remember that day when i was sitting right infront in the middle row doing my homework when those girls came and sat behind me
1	They started saying these reaplly bad things about me
1	when i tried 5o ignore and laugh like my mother said , one of them started pulling my hair and even slapped me several times
1	One of them bullied and the other one who controlled her laughed
1	I was n't able to hold my emotions and broke down that day
1	After two years the bullying stopped when my mother finally complained
1	It is true that when you have no one to talk to your mind starts talking a lot
1	I became aware of my senses and asked the same things over and over again
1	It was like i was going crazy and naive , i lost interest in everything , i even lost my appetite
1	With GREAT EFFORT i overcame it but it is still within me and sometimes htries to have an impact
1	I even got some health issues like acidity , dehydration when i completely fainted and had to be taken to the hospital due to low blood pressure , got UTI infection which went uPTO more than 150hpf , allergic asthama when suddenly i was finding it so diffulty breathing at night it was the worst feeling ever
1	i almost thought i would die at some point i had to struggle so much and my parents had to stay awake all night with mebut when i got myself diagnosed my doctpr said there was nothing
1	I often feel bad about myself , my grades have lowered , i oversleep , have mood swings and much prefer to be isolated in my room
1	Its become so worse that i have even got into cutting my ownself
1	I know its bad but i feel so bad about myself
1	My mom has no idea about the cuttings but i tol her that i need a therapist
1	Her reaction to this was naive she says its all a phase of life and it would end soon on its own
1	I do nt get out much because of lack of friendship and i just do nt like to be around people anymore
1	Sometimes i feel like getting out of thid place And live somewhere else where no one know 's me and start a new lifeall my friends who were not truly my friends were toxic and ignorant and i have promised myself that i would never make up with such fake friends
1	I would be better off without them

1	I am 25 yrs old when I was 4 years old my parents separatedmy father got married again

1	I wanna kill my self
1	With advice I will never change   Pls share some effective ideas for suicide pls
1	This is a psychological question After 16 years of marriage we went through a crisis , he worked and worked non caring of me and the kids I felt abandoned , even on sundays we could not stay together because he took the kids to his mother 's to have lunch , but he lefte me home I then thought he did not care for me and started to go on a crisis and I asked for separation I have now been separated for 5 years and got divorced last december All through these steps i have slowly begun to realize it s been a terrible mistake and i am missing him terribly
1	I know it may sound crazy , but it 's what i m feeling and it 's strong
1	I miss him , the simple things we did together , staying in the family with our kids
1	I now see that it was all wrong , and i would turn back time and find a different way to solve our problems
1	I had a relation for 3 years after the separation , we broke last summer , but now he has another woman , and I do n't know what step to take , if tell him or not It is a terrible situation where I feel guilt , loneliness , jealousy , and a mix of negative feelings all together and in some moments i feel i can not cope
1	I only have my kids for whom i live , and a feeble hope I am not strong in this period , i need to restore my selfconfidence and maybe then i will try to talk to him We used to be both very much in love , it was all a series of misunderstandings , but i feel it ca n't end this way I know i may sound ridiculous
1	But i made a mistake and want to fix , restore my relation with him
1	Thank you all for your advice
1	I have adult son 38,he always gave us trouble from early teens , actually controlled my whole family , husband never disciplined he was too mild mannored I was always trying to keep my son out of trouble and on the straight and narrow , defied me , never satisfied , always showed anger towards me , very manipulative , everyone loves him he is like the mayor , lots of friends and hard working , very popular with kids and adults , esp friends cause he would do what other kids always were afraid to do because of parents punishment
1	I tried alwys to get him help but I just came out as a over bearing mother , andmy husband never supported me , we had good marriage aaccept when it came to children rearing he never teamed up with me
1	sat back and made me look like bad guy , I have a daughter 36 she was sweet and great no trouble till her teens she always took back seat and was satisfied with whatever came her way , she was very patient cause her brother ran the house and she was good , teeanage years she started to rebel but did n't get the attention like my son I was non tolerant and she left home and then back in her 20s and learned that she did have good parents she rebelled and upset taking all her bros crap we all did
1	I could never get him help schools loved him always told me to support and keep him away he was smart handsome and I could not understand why he was so angry and mean to me at home
1	my husband just ignored me
1	my son I always told my husband he needed help he ignored me my son hated me made life miserable for me and all of us but husband took it , he never had lots of girls he was popular but one at a time
1	he went with a girl broke his heart too young 16 , then he was soft and cried , I believed too young
1	then at 17 met a girl no parents mother and father died lived with old fashioned grandmother , she was the youngest of the group the sweetes every mothers dream thought God sent her to us
1	she was happy to have support from a good family a handsome strong husband who would give her security and love forever
1	I worried as he was a handful and I told my husband I felt she might be a pushover and he could control her or she may change him for the better as she was kind and quiet and accepting of him 100 well he always treated me mean thru me out of his house many times for speaking my peace when he would boss his 6 year old and make him cry and scream and yell and call names and disrespect his wife , I intervened and said it was not right so he would throw me out , my husband would say do n't go there that 's why he does n't go there , but that 's not my way I wanted to help hope he would not get worse and his wife 8 years put up with it stuck by him and loved him and he treated her as badly as me
1	everyone else thought he was mr wonderful all the people that praised him and his bad behavior and his risky character and his defiance to authority everyone loved it but never would be that way , his son is 8 now mild mannered I watched him while his parents went to work my son tried not for me to do it but his wife trusted us and the son loved us
1	now he was caught cheating while his wife was having a baby treated her terrible during pregnancy and during birth , so sad he was cheating and not admitting it , and treating her horrible
1	I continued to watch baby and the 8 year old I went there one day to bring kids home , he was there and left when I got there I said hi he was not living ther any more , I said I wish he would have tried but did n't get into any conversation and said my husband missed him
1	when I left the kids off I went into my truck drove down the block and he smashed my truck on the passenger side and then went up front and back into it 2x and then went around the block and crashed behind and totaled my truck while I was in it
1	I was in hospital someone called police could not believe he would do this for no reason and was very upset
1	police wanted to prosecute everyone said you ca nt he would lose job and not have money for kids and you do n't do that to son , so I dropped everything but the DA angry said it was not right
1	but I had no choice now they insisted on temp order of protection till 2015 he just has to behave in my company that 's it
1	he refuses to see me tells my grandson I make trouble and hates me and my grandson hurts so bad as he loves me , the little one is close to us 2 years old but growing up fast with the rough tough boys times they have and his wild woman girlfriend
1	my daughter in law is weak and wo nt fight him she is afraid he might her her but wo nt speak up says she just wants peace , the boys of course enjoy his company when playing rough or doing things that young kids do n't do , obscene movies violent movies , speeding , no discipline unless the father is being watched by other parents then he will be like the father of the year and over due it and yelling at son in front of people if he cusses and behaves like the father does
1	he looks like the father of the year and I know the 8 year old is torn between being a sweet loving boy growing up confused and in the middle of seeing and hearing all of this
1	the little one is touph and rough at 2 , he mimicks the father says bad words and just starteda talking we reprimand and try hard and in my house they are both wonderful and admired by people how behaved they are
1	but when they are with meim afraid to go forward and confront him as he might be phyco path behavior I researched seems to have all the symptoms he convinced everyone that I hit his car and I suffered the consequene cause I would not go to grand jury , he would have lost
1	so I did n't go forward he tells everyone long tall stories that I crashed into him and lies and lies to justify his story , it makes it so hard for kids to be with us and family times
1	she gives him the kids everyonther weekend and more nites during the week , they come to my home in morning to drop 2 year old off and then bring the 8 year old to school after sleeping the nite at fathers 2 nites a week and wake up and then go to mothers and then to grandmothers and school up so early and its too much on them 2 year old comes exhausted and the 8 year old tired does n't even want to go to school , my daughter in law does not like the waves and says nothing
1	I try to talk but she just does what he controls her to do
1	she wo nt go to court , he def wo nt sign papers so he would be ordered by court he does as he pleases when he pleases
1	not a good roll model , I love my son always wanted to get him help I knew this was going to happen I was a realistic person saw it cominghe was myson my little boy wonders what I did what I said , that made him what he is today
1	I thought I was a good motherbut ca nt get to the bottom accept that he could not ocntroll me and I always stopped him from trouble
1	I was the one he brought for cars , and jewelry wedding rings
1	and then you hate me
1	and he would say i m going to get a ring you want to see it
1	if you do n't like it too bad I bought it already ,
1	with everything he would take me and talk like this I just dealth with it
1	what advice if any could you give me
1	i m been suffering , I have diabetes am on discibility now my eyes are not the best , but still ble to see my grandchildren and help them thru this while they work but anyother time I wo nt see them holidays special occasions , she wo nt bring them and he wo nt be in our company so this is the only way
1	I wo nt give them up its what I live for now to save them at least while I can
1	is there any advice you can give me to make some sence of this
1	hi I am 22 years old and have been diagnosed with BPD for years
1	I have read alot about BPD though and at the moment i am questioning the diagnosis
1	I mean i do n't consider myself to have unstable relationships
1	i have friends that i have been friends with for over 10 years and we rarely ever fight
1	I do have low self esteem and the only thing i can really think that I do on impulse is self injure
1	I do sometimes fear being alone but at the same time i often want to be alone
1	i do nt go between putting someone on a pedistol and then devaluing them
1	i 'm not exactly sure what unstable self image is but if its what i think then yes
1	i can go from being content to suicidal within minutes
1	i am often suspicious of others an my lose of reality i guess would be voices and dissociating
1	I would like you re opinion because if you agree with the diagnosis then i 'm not going to get re evaluated by another doctor but if you disagree then i may
1	since we get engaged her opinion should be confirm , am an excellent negotiator but when it comes to my wife she always wins
1	the main problem is when she got mad , she say lot of disappointing issues like my life is disaster because of you , i wish i never marry you , you are so mean , , , etc or i think that when she got nothing to say she tells me that she s not comfort and when i ask why she says i do n't know , i just feel that
1	if we were talking on the phone and she get mad of something she hangup
1	if i had an opinion like she was planning travel , i tried to convince her to do so but she wo nt listen , but when i talked to her sister she convinced her so easy why she do n't listen to me from the first place
1	the other day she told me   i do nt know what my life would be if we did not get married or if she got married to a different person or did not married at all
1	she was OK before that , it happened suddenly , i told her why you think this way , she say nothing am just thinking , so i told her what do you think
1	she say i do n't know but one thing for sure that my life will be different , i told her i also think so but no matter this life would be am much happier with the life you gave me , , she just closed her mouth and when we talked about that next day she say   do nt make me feel sorry for sharing you my feelings and what am thinking of one more thing , she create any excuses to avoid making love with me please tell me what to do , am desperate and i do n't wanna make any dissensions to fell sorry about
1	hi , recently i was told my grandma has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenia
1	she has been having mental disturbances for the past several years and is in her late 70 's
1	my mother has been keeping me updated is not the most trustworthy person she has come back from several terminal illnessess over the years and has been wanted for fraud and i am not sure i can believe all the stories she sends me
1	supposedly my grandma thinks people are trying to kill or rape her
1	she spends entire nights screaming
1	she believes family members come over to steal from her when they have nt seen her for years
1	she thinks i have a second child that lives in a tree in the yard
1	she ties her hair in knots and then has no idea who did it to her
1	from my reading it is very rare for a person of her age to develop schizophrenia and would like to hear from peoples personal experiences
1	I had one person that was very kind in sending me a message   Thank you
1	Please if anyone else can help me with my situation   I am constipated from being on Lex and have been off Lex for 30 days and I 'm still SLIGHTLY constipated
1	I am so bloated and I look 4 months pregnant
1	I am taking a multivitamin with fish oil EVERY DAY and this seems to help me pass once a day but the bloating is not going away
1	I AM EXERCISING AND EATING RIGHT but for some strange reason my belly is huge
1	And I am off Lex for 30 days now
1	Dear Doctor , About 6 weeks ago my right elbow and right knee joints started to hurt
1	2 weeks later during my business trip which included several hrs of airport delays , I suddenly got this strange pain in both of my hips , both my shoulders and continuing with the elbow , then both wrist and fingure and jaw joints
1	The pain would worsen when I would get up after a period of sitting down , in an air conditioned room , and during my sleep
1	From being called a pretzel due to my body flexibility , now I ca n't change my cloth or walk staight without hurting
1	To add to the problem 4 weeks later , I also developed tingling feelings in all my fingers , and hands
1	I am a 49 yr old female who is behind the computer 10 hours a day with a very stressful work
1	The noticeable changes in the past 2 months have been that at work we moved to a very bad air quality location with lots of draft
1	Also , after 3 years of taking BC pills I decided to stop it and see if I will become menauposal
1	I did start getting hot flashes 3 weeks later and just got the result of blood work to confirm my menopause
1	So far , I have seen an orthopedic Doc , a gynocologist , an Neurologist and now waiting for a Rheumotologist appt
1	Also , I would think that RhumotoArthritus would not suddenly hit a healthy person this way
1	I have read similar questions in your section but from young male
1	I have become even more health conscious since my pain started
1	Please help me to narrow down this if you have known of similar cases
1	I was sexually abused for 7 years 511 and never told anyone about it
1	My parents found out about it when I was 14
1	To this day I have never cried about it , never spoken about it aside from that one day my parents found out , and even then it was just to confirm to them that I did nt have sex with the abusereven though I did So this has seemed for almost my entire life that it is nt a problem aside from the fact that I have various other issues with my family and eating disorders and drugs , cutting etc
1	In fact the only reason I am writing on here is because I have nt cut myself in 4 years unti tonight when for some reason I just started freaking out and did nt knw whatto do , i felt like I was having a panic attack and it was almost instinctual that I reached for something sharp , it was so bizarre because I have nt felt like that in years
1	Also I ve had a shrink for 4 years and I am still seeing her , still very happy with her , yet , we have never really talked about the abuse though she knows all about it she refrences it sometimes but she says that to tackle that issue , we first have to tackle all the issues that may or may not have risen from that situation
1	Still I have no emotion towards this topic , and I feel that I have nothing to say , like its not a part of my life anymore
1	I guess this really is nt a question , more of just a general enquiring into anyone who may have felt o have been feeling the same thing , and what steps they are taking to overcome , or somehow deal with this
1	Because I know deep down somewhere there is ovbiously something wrong otherwise I would not be the way that I am
1	Good afternoon , Thank you for taking the time to view my question
1	I am a 52 year old woman , nonsmoker , I have had three children and up to a few years ago a spot perfect period
1	About 5 years ago I had spotting and I went to my doctor where I had a biopsy , pap and ultrasound done
1	They found that I had fibroid s and which may be causing my spotting
1	My periods seem to come now every 23rd day not like the 28th like I used to have
1	In the past 6 months my periods have been all wacky
1	I miss a month
1	Then I have two periods in one month and then it seems normal again
1	I just went for a pap but my dr explained that a pap will not show uterine cancer
1	My question after this long book I have written hereis this
1	Can this fluctuation in my periods due to the fact I am about to become menopausal or could this indeed be cancer
1	Thanks again for reading my post and have a great day
1	She was around 67 when she began to ' selfharm ' her breasts   no where else
1	Sorry in advance if this is explicit   I feel like it 's not normal , but I 'm wondering whether she was exploring at that age and it just stuck
1	One time she had used those pants hanger things to clamp her breasts nile area and we found out and told her not to do that etc
1	another time she was sticking led pencils into one of her nipples and pulling them out   which was absolutely mortifying for us
1	We caught her , otherwise would never have known
1	Another time she had literally clamped her breasts to the clothes line and would walk ' like a slave ' which is what she said she imagined in her mind
1	She 's was caught on a chat site with some explicit material at one point when she was around 7 , but that was one off and the chat material did not suggest the other person was aware she was young and it was with a stranger   ie
1	She has a fear of the dark even now and used to have and has nightmares about her brother being taken away and thieves breaking in , she checks all the doors , etc
1	I thought perhaps she watched a film or something , cause she did one time watch a horror when she was n't supposed to   it was after a disney cartoon and she was to be asleep
1	do the dishes , study hard   no fun until you finish all your homework   funlearning stuff her mother has been violent towards her once or twice
1	We have asked her , but she says she ca n't remember anything , she is now 13
1	She still ' plays with her breastsselfharms in that manner it has n't stopped
1	I just want to get an idea of whether I am overreacting about this and it was just her exploringcoping with fighting and overcontrolling parents at home
1	My son is 37 years old and hit his head in dec 2013 and has been having seizures has been to hospital 3 times they did the EEG with camera in hospital saw one of the few Epitologists in KC Mo he sd were not epileptic seizures but stress seizures
1	They told him that sometimes a head injury brings forward things they suppressed clear back to childhood
1	His dad was an absent father , He lost his uncle who he was very close to when he was a teen and never cried
1	At 24 his 28 year old wife had a massive stroke he stayed w her 10 more years then they divorced his new girlfriend had showers of strokes and he took care of her a year and when her family did n't help like they said they would he moved her to her moms and is now with a woman who is sick all the time
1	The doctors told him that it is common with head injuries all the things they suppressed come forward and he has to see a psychiatrist in order to quit having seizures and until he does he will continue to have seizures
1	He lost his job over it because he worked for a small company and companies with less than 50 employees do n't have to follow FMLA that sure added to his stress
1	Somebody please HELP Does any of this even sound rightThis young man has had a job ever since he was 15 years old and has always been the care giver does n't know how to handle not working not being able to drive and stress of not being able to pay bills I am not a rich person and ca n't help him pay monthly bills
1	Is it the suppressed things in his life that have caused this or is it the stress he is going thru right now
1	I 'm April and am looking for ways to deal with stress in a healthy wayDoes anyone have any good ideas for the best way to deal with stress
1	I guess I do n't deal with stress very well
1	I also can let things overwhelm me if I 'm not careful and can get almost panicky
1	I 'm a bit of a perfectionist and also a people pleaser so I do get stressed easily when things seem to get out of controlI do want to learn ways to handle stress well as I feel this even affects my health
1	I 've had a lot of stress over the years , especially the last few years and it 's taken a toll on me
1	I know people say to take a deep breath , do yoga , or whatever , but when you 're really stressed , you honestly ca n't think that way , you know
1	I guess I need to learn to catch it before it gets that bad maybe
1	My 5yearold son has a dad but finds it a rather frustrating and boring experience to spend time with him   because his dad just drives him to his house about 3 days per month and then just does his own thing while our son is trapped in there looking at books and staring out the window   or so he described it
1	The other day my son watched his best friend being yanked off the playground by his dad nothing dramatic and said That s why I do nt like dads
1	It sent off a warning light to me that his image of The Male is starting to get worped
1	I work in an almost allmale environment , so my son is used to all those guys being cool dudes and nice and playful with him when he happens to be at work   but I do nt know how to restore the image he has of his own dad
1	I only know one guy from work who wanted to join the Big Brother network at some point   and he is a guy with extremely low selfesteem who felt that HE needed the attention that kids would give him
1	Okay , well I 'm a 14 year old girl and I missed my last period
1	It worried me alot even though I 've never had sex
1	Now , my period is really late and I 'm really scared and stressed
1	I 've had a boyfriend for 3 months and I really love him , but I DO NOT let him do anything that I 'm not ready for
1	So I 'm still a virgin , and I do n't plan on that changing any time soon , but anyway , I do n't know what 's going on
1	I 'm afraid to tell him or my mom , because I know my mom will immediately start accusing me of being I ginormous   and destroying my purity WHICH I HAVEN'T DONE
1	The most I 've done is wrapped my legs around his waist while we were in a pool
1	So I do n't think anything could 've happened therebut anyway , I really need some help here
1	I 'm scared beyond words , you guys
1	UPDATE Alright , well I took a pregnancy test today to see if I 'm pregnant because I missed my period last month and I should 've started yesterday but I have n't
1	I 'm 14 and a virgin , but I 've been showing some signs of pregnancy and I 'm very , very scared and paranoid
1	I took one today and it said it was negative
1	It recommended to take it in the morning I think , but it was around 1000 or 1100 pm
1	It 's been around a month since my last period should 've started
1	I 've been eating a lot less lately and I 've been very stressed
1	I woke up with a headache yesterday and last month my stomach was cramping like period cramps
1	My breasts might 've grown a little bit but they 're not sore at all
1	I 've been looking kinda bloated lately , but it might just be me
1	I know I have n't had sex , but vaginas are weird and complicated , y'know
1	The most sexual thing I ever did with my boyfriend was wrap my legs around his waist in a pool while he carried me around
1	And I 'm PRETTY SURE he did n't because we were n't really doing anything besides kissing and floating around at a waterpark
1	I dunno , I guess there 's a lot that I still do n't know
1	But like I said , it 's been around a month and I took my pregnancy test today
1	I did n't really have to pee so it took a while and I was rushed to try to force it out , which is pretty impossible to do when you 're peeing
1	I touched the absorbent part of the test for less than a second before I used it
1	I feel like I 'm going to miss this period as well
1	It 's stressing me out so much and I 'm so scared
1	PS sorry if its too much information , but I have masturbated well not really , just feeling around before , and I do n't think my hymen could 've broke , but that was a while ago
1	PPS when I missed my period the first time , I put a tampon in just to be sure , and when I took it out , it had a little light brownpinkish stuff on it , but then that was it
1	I felt sick today , but I think it was just from the nerves when I told my mombecause she jumped to conclusions
1	Hi , I 'm new to this forum but I really need any sort of help I can get at this point so here I am
1	I 'm 21 , female , and have had Major Depressive Disorder since I was about 10 or 11 years old
1	I was on Lexapro for 5 years then hospitalized and then was on a variety of different antidepressants for a few years until earlier this summer my newest psychiatrist decided to put me back on Lexapro 20 mg as it is what is working for my mom
1	My problem is that I am dealing with an immense amount of suicidal ideation and planning on a daily basis , and I really ca n't control it
1	I remember being highly suicidal when I was first on Lexapro , but I was also dealing with some terrible situations and saw it as a normal reaction to dealing with that
1	I admit I am still going through a lot right now , but I know I 've found ways to feel normal before , before starting Lexapro again
1	I feel like there are two different people in me right now , one just craving to end it all and not have to worry about a single thing again and then there 's the normal me that wants to keep fighting
1	It 's literally a battle in my head between the two all day every day
1	I have a psychiatrist with a phenomenal reputation , but I feel she 's just too busy to deal with me and what I am going through , as she deals with many other serious clientele
1	I 'm lost as to what to do , my withdrawals from Lexapro include even worse suicidal ideation than when I am on it , plus I get the brain zaps and constantly feel nauseous
1	I am also afraid there are little medications left to try out and I really do n't want to be hospitalized again , though that is what my mom is recommending
1	I do n't think I actually want to die , but I 'm afraid that part of me that does want that has been winning for the past couple months and I do n't want to make a stupid , permanent decision
1	I 'm currently having some problems with my treatment and I was hoping someone could help me out or just share experiences
1	Long post ahead , sorry for that   I was diagnosed with depression a little over 2 months ago
1	At first I was put on Fluoxetine , Clonazepam 0,25 during the day if I ever felt very anxious and Zolpidem at night , since I was having trouble sleeping
1	After 10 days on Fluoxetine , when the initial dose was increased , I experienced some really bad side effects , like extreme agitation and complete lack of appetite
1	Because of depression I was already underweight , so my psychiatrist decided to switch me to Sertraline instead , to keep me from losing more weight
1	The first week I still had some nasty adverse effects like insomnia , sweaty hands and feet , lack of appetite and insomnia
1	I also stopped taking Clonazepam during the day , but instead I stared taking 0,5 mg and 5 mg of Zolpidem at night , which has helped my sleeping patterns
1	After the first week or so , the adverse effects slowly disappeared and my mood improved a lot
1	I was honestly loving Sertraline , because it made me feel the way I was before the depressive episode and it also improved my anxiety
1	About two weeks ago , I started getting diarrhea
1	At first it did n't bother me , because I spend most of my time at home and I just though it would eventually go away like the other adverse effects
1	However , it has n't really stopped and my psychiatrist told me it might not go away , and that she wanted to change me to Venlafaxine
1	She told me diarrhea is keeping me from gaining weight and might damage my colon if it goes on
1	Now , I did n't think it was such a big deal and I was considering to just keep taking Sertraline until the diarrhea was gone , but this week I started having stomach pain
1	I 've also felt dizzy and woke up with vertigo the other day
1	I feel week and I guess it 's because my body really is n't absorbing the nutrients I need anymore
1	This being said should I switch to Venlafaxine or give Sertraline one last try this upcoming week and see if the symptoms get better
1	I 'm just feel really frustrated right now because I do n't want to go through another adjustment period again , and having to face more side effects again
1	I even thought about slowly weaning off Sertraline , thinking that since I 'm not going to college anymore I 'll still feel a lot calmer and may not need the anti depressants at all
1	I know the minimum treatment for depression is six months but I just do n't know anymore
1	Ok so I 'm a 31 yo female with a normal productive place in society but there 's this weird thing that I do and have done for as long as I can remember where I 'll have a conversation in my head with someone I know even though its a conversation that I 'm not going to have with the person ever but instead of just in my head I say it out loud and will get stuck on how to say what I 'm saying the best way , that I repeat over and over and it can be word for word or slightly different by I can not stop until I suddenly am aware of what I 'm doing and sometimes that will put a stop to it but sometimes I can go right back to doing it without realizing
1	It 's usually just half in my head and half quietly out loud to myself but sometimes I will find myself talking as loud as I would be normally to somebody nearby
1	I remember being like 8 or 9 and being aware of this and feeling extremely embarrassed if someone caught me
1	The other night when I was driving home I suddenly realized that I had been doing it for the entire 30 min ride but what freaked me out is that I was talking very loudly but then was truly shocked when I finally did realize it
1	It 's a devastation feeling lie control of it anymore because I do n't know when it 's hhappening anyone has any kind of insight to what this is I 'd love to hear it
1	My 13 year old son thinks I chose my fiance over him
1	I have been a single mom   lived   my parents house
1	I just recently purchased a brand new home w my fiance   his child in April
1	It was hard for all of us to adjust to eachothers ways   schedulesI can admit me   my fiance were arguing quite often about the littlest things
1	My son would go to his dads house every other weekends also
1	We had only lived in the house for 3 weeks   My son went   tld his dad there was arguing in the home   my sons dad served me w ex parte papers
1	We go to court   court recommends supervised visits   also if I would like to havemy son that I would move out of my home   back to my parents house
1	I was tld by my son that his dad has told him that he wo nt be able to see me for 2 yrs if he do nt tell the court that I need help   need supervised visitsMy son says I chose my fiance cuz I wouldve moved to my parents
1	My son says he do nt want to have supervised visits but his dad tld him its me who wants it
1	I have been seeing my son in supervised visits but its really hard   do feel my son is unhappy there
1	My fiance   i have stopeed our arguing   our relationship has gotten better , but I still want my son in my life
1	I went to my sons football game a few months ago   his father told him do nt look at your mom or talk to your mom because she do nt care about you   my son listened to his dadI told the court my sons dad brainwashes my son   the father argues that he does not
1	My sons dad is making my son believe i , a bad , pther   making my son believe that I chose my fiance over my sonI do nt know what alse to do   do nt want him to feel that i chose my fiance
1	Hi , to start of , i 'm 18 male from Australia
1	I 've been going through signs and symptoms which have been affecting my life greatly
1	These include Frequent urination , back pains in the center of my back , numbness when i go through some bad stress for a short period eg a day , inability to keep my eyes open when reading something that might seem stressful such as my school work which is affecting it greatly
1	My eyes close uncontrollably every time I read for 4 secs
1	I 'm mostly worried about my school work
1	I 've had blood tests twice which supposedly ruled out nothing wrong except abit of bacteria ruling the obvious UTI
1	I know you might say that I 'm simply going through a UTI although i disagree
1	If i absorb the smallest amount of bacteria such as the typical toilet breaks , I get massive signssymptoms of UTI
1	I 've been having toilet breaks the same way for many years therefore there is something odd
1	I believe my chronic stress weakened my immune system resulting in even the smallest amounts of bacteria to be a huge negative load on my body
1	Now I 've been trying to manage stress but my signssymptoms still remain
1	If I have chronic stress , how long until i expect it to subside
1	Maybe I 'm simply having all these due to my anxiety and negative thinking
1	I 'm really desperate for help and if anyone would like to talk if your going through the same or just to help me then feel free to email me at   Thanks
1	POST FROM jun 30 I wisih I knew whether I am right about my mother or whether I 've constructed an elaborate fantasy to cover up my own failings who can tell
1	nobody believes me when I try to get help
1	I 'm 31 , and I get told off by people who say GET A JOB
1	my nerves were so bad , I cried every day nad night in silence , terrified they would see me , because they forced me to get the job
1	and one day , I accidentally broke down in thecar just as we got there
1	They rewarded my emotions with yelling
1	  I got sick with the flu a few months later i 'd see nthis cute baby with a flu , and I thought , OMG my way out of this hellhole
1	I tried to do my job right but I had to escape
1	I hope he 's okay now , and healthy
1	today , she claimed I was trying to attack her nad called the cops on me
1	  I feel like I 'm in hell
1	my dad does n't believe me , but he sure is quick to call her paranoid when it 's convenient for him
1	I am in hell I am in hell I am in hlel
1	I have no friends in the US where I live
1	I tel everybody I can lay my hands on and they all say weird things that I do n't understand , like it 's not true
1	my possibly paranoidnarcissisticborderlinehistrionic mom called the cops on me today , claiming she thought I was going to attack her
1	I just was hysterical and trying to get the phone away from her so icould beg the 911 operator to take me away from here
1	I may talk big , but she KNOWs I would not
1	she just likes , in my opinion , to get my dad to yell at me
1	she 's managed ot convince the police 9city hall is , unfortunately , across the street that I am whatever it was she told them about me , and they 've come to the house twice now , which was very traumatizing for me
1	I 'm hypersensitive , and probably aspie , and I have attention deficit
1	I tried to wotk , but they forced me itno that before I was ready , and because of that idoubt I will ever be ready now , because I cried every day and night from stress , had nightmares , and when I revealed this to them accidentaly by bareaking down one day before they drove me to work , they rewarded my tears with yelling , claiming they were ' trying ot scare me into stopping or something
1	I ca n't work due to sheer nerves and beign around people making me tired , confused and extremely suggestible , not to mention panic attacks
1	everyone I tell this to does n't believe me
1	they believe her
1	I think I 'm turbing into an emotionallyverbally abusive manipulative   like what I think she might be
1	she seems , to me , to want everyone to think I m batshit
1	but I feel like she 's batshit
1	my father wo nt help me he 's her
1	iIf I am right about her , she manipulates him into taking her ' side ' with tears , feigned illness , and goes so far as to eat badly on purpose and not exercise to exacerbate her health issues to manipulate us further
1	What do I do when nobody I go to for help will believe me
1	if I am the bad one , what the hlel is wrong with me
1	I 'm no picnic either , but when somebody hurts somebody else , I do n't like it
1	does n't mean I do n't do it too , but truly , I do n't like it
1	I have looked on the internet because I have been having some changes to my mouth and throat
1	The very back part of my throat the deepest part I can see looks like it has small red and white bumps
1	I went to my schools clinic and she just said I had strep and gave me amoxil to take
1	I took the medicine but did n't change out my toothbrush like she said
1	I do n't know if that makes a difference My throat did not clear up
1	I have never been to a gyno or had a Pap smear but I have an upcoming appointment in a month
1	I also never had the hpv shots and I have been sexually active
1	I have been worried for the past 4 months that I have something wrong
1	I apologize for length ahead of time , but I just wanted to include the back story leading up to my experience with an oncologist yesterday
1	When I was 16 I started getting a shootingelectric shock feeling pain to the left side of my face
1	Around that same time I noticed a lump under my chin , and the Doctor said it was just a swollen lymph node
1	A different doctor said that sometimes on thin people I weigh about 115lbs lymph nodes can be felt more easily , and I should n't be too concerned since I was young
1	About 2 years ago I 'm 27 now the shock pain to my face came back , and I started getting frequent migraines
1	I went to a neurologist and they stated I have trigeminal neuralgia and chronic complex migraines
1	I noticed in the last year that the lump was even bigger , and about 3 months ago I noticed a lump right infront of my left ear that was not there before
1	I have also had other symptoms which led to my neurologist doing tests to find out if I had multiple sclerosis
1	My other symptoms are hot flashessweating , confusionforgetfulness , loss of appetite , 10 lb weight loss in the last year , itchiness all over it gets so bad that my skin gets flaky , constant diarrhea , fatigueweakness , 6 lowgrade fevers in the last year , and muscle spasms
1	MS was ruled out , and my primary doctor requested an ultrasound of my neck to check out the lumps
1	The radiology report for my ultrasound stated I have 6 swollen lymph nodes with the largest one being 15 cm on the short scale , and the others ranging from 4 mm to 9 mm
1	It was determined that the lumps are probably putting pressure on my trigeminal nerve since they are located on the same path as the nerve , it could explain the increase in the occurrence of trigeminal neuralgia attacks as the lumps were growing
1	After the ultrasound I also noticed that I could feel two lumps on the small of my back , but I do n't know how long they have been there
1	My father had melanoma that metastasized to his brain and lymph nodes , and passed away at 44
1	He was told probably he had cancer for about 10 years before its discovery and could have had a better chance if it was found sooner
1	My mother had precancerous cells to her lymph nodes , thyroid , and cervix which lead to having them surgically removed
1	Due to my family 's history , I expressed my concern with my primary doctor and he referred me to an oncologist to set up a biopsy thinking on one hand they could be benign and their removal will take pressure off of my trigeminal nerve , and on the other hand it could be canerous
1	I saw a hematologistoncologist yesterday , and he spent no more than 10 minutes with me
1	All he did was glance over my blood test , touch my neck , and touch my back
1	He stated that my lumps were not lymph nodes , and that they were salivary glands
1	He said that all I needed to do was gargle warm saltwater every night to get my salivary glands to activate , and if the lumps do n't go down after that I should go to an ENT
1	I informed him that the report from a radiologist of my ultrasound stated the lumps were lymph nodes , and asked if he wanted to view the disc of my ultrasound since I brought it with me
1	He dismissed this saying he did n't need to see it as lymph nodes are located on the sides of the neck not under my chin though anatomy images show lymph nodes also run under the chin , and that the radiologist probably misinterpreted the image
1	He stated the lumps on my back also were not lymph nodes , and that they were probably cysts or neuromas
1	He also stated I may have mono or herpes , and that it could be causing my salivary glands to become inflamed I am skeptical that this is the case as I have only been with my husband , and we 've been together for 10 years
1	He ordered a blood test for infectitious diseases , and stated he would call me on Monday to inform me of whether or not I have mono or herpes
1	I informed him that the whole purpose of the appointment was to get me set up for a biopsy for the lumps , and he stated he does n't see a need for a biopsy
1	I did tell him every symptom I had , and he stated that my symptoms were vague and could be caused by any number of things
1	He also stated he does n't see a need to order even a CT scan in the least to confirm that my lumps were my salivary glands and not lymph nodes
1	He said I 'm very young , and should n't be too concerned with the possibility of cancer
1	This Doctor has a reputable reputation according to online reviews and is listed as a lymphoma specialist , so a part of me wonders if he 's just that good at identifying tumors or if he was being dismissive due to me being too young
1	I 'm 16 years old girl and I think I 'm depressed
1	I feel like there is no reason for me to live anymore
1	I 'm sorry in advance for any mistakes , English is not my native language
1	I do n’t enjoy doing anything I used to like , and nothing is important to me anymore
1	My grades are constantly dropping because I ca n't concentrate , I stopped hanging out with my friends , and I have troubles sleeping
1	Though , the thing that bothers me the most is that I have no feelings
1	I wish I was sad because then I would had something to complain about
1	Everything is just pointless , and it makes me feel like death is the best option , but then again I do n’t want to commit a suicide
1	I have been thinking of that for years but I would n't do it
1	My parents sent me to therapy at the beginning of the year because they said I became withdraw , as if I was a stranger in their home , but I stopped after 2 sessions because it was too hard for me
1	I do n’t want to be back there , but I do n’t know what else to do
1	I 'm 18 years old and the other night I had sex with this girl and i do n't know if I got her pregnant
1	Me and this girl usually have sex but I do not have any feelings for her whatsoever
1	Anyways , when we had sex a couple nights ago I pulled out yes I have a condom as always and the condom was REALLY wet inside and mostly at the head not the base
1	During sex it kept slipping a bit I usually use this size it 's even tight on me and I figured it was her fluids making it do that
1	I think to my self it 's supposed to be real wet inside you do n't want it on the outside do you
1	And then I tell myself what if she 's pregnant I also have bad anxiety so I might be overthinking
1	I also told her to get plan B but she said no we 're fine
1	She wo n't listen so if she ended up pregnant I 'd feel trapped
1	But first , do you guys think I got her pregnant
1	I apologize if this is long , I 'm just really confused right now
1	I have been with my husband for over 10 years
1	We have 4 kids together and he has raised my oldest now 13 since she was a toddler
1	He 's the only Dad she 's ever known
1	We are n't perfect parents , we both have depression and mood disorders and take medication
1	My husband has made great strides the last few yers with his anger problems , I had done well until I went off meds for a pregnancy and have since been very moody
1	I had thought that the last several months my oldest and I and she and my husband had both improved our relationships with each other
1	She was talking to me more , chatting about friends and asking me all kinds of questions about just abotu everything
1	Her and her Dad stepdad seemed to get al ong better as well
1	I 've known for awhile that she has a problem with internalizing her feelings and not talking about them
1	Last night I got the shock of my life
1	She had gone to stay at a friends house and in the middle of the night I get a call from the LAW telling me they have my daughter
1	My husband and I both went down there , we had to take the rest of the kids with us
1	When we got there they asked him to stay in the waiting room with the kids
1	I went back and had my world compeltely turned upside down
1	My daughter has accused my husband of molesting her
1	I want to believe them both
1	The only incidents she has brought up have been this past week , starting wednesday to be exactshe says that once he rubbed her crotch and made a throaty noise and that another day he asked to see her breasts
1	He 's not mad , more , but he keeps going over things trying to figure out what he did that she could have misconstrued
1	She 's not usually the type to make stuff up but at the same time she is easily persuaded into thinking things
1	I find it odd that she just so happened to be at this girls house when all this went down
1	Her behavior and demeanor have not changed over the last several days , she did n't tell me , nor did she tell her grandma whom she confides a lot of stuff in
1	She saved some texts that her dad sent her but as the officer said it 's nothing incriminating
1	My husband has to go down tuesday to make a statement and will be offered a lie detector test
1	Soemthing that bothers me about her accusations is that she 's always been one to not like saying words that refer to private parts or talking about sexually related things
1	Even in just asking me things about pregnancy she gets really shy and mumbles when she says stuff
1	But last night when they turned on the tape to record her statement she was spitting things out almost like it was rehearsed
1	In light of the situation I sent her back to her friends for the night becuase I had nowhere else for any of us to go
1	Becuase of the sitaution I went in her room and found her journal and read it
1	I wanted to see if maybe she mentioned anything in it
1	Mostly about how much she hates me and DH and calls us a bunch of names and talks about how she enjoys pushing our buttons and that she thinks WE enjoy pissing HER off
1	She talks about this boy she likes and goes on to mention something about marks on her wrist and cutting herself
1	I 've never noticed these but I do n't go inspecting her wrists either
1	I will be checking when she gets home
1	She also refers to her siblings as the rest of the little SHS From what I read it 's obvious she has serious anger and resentment issues with us
1	I have never seen anything inappropriate between my husband and her or my husband and our other daughter
1	I do n't want to believe she 's a liar but I do n't want to believe my husband is a child molester either
1	I will also be calling first thing monday to schedule an appt with a psychiatric counselor for my daughter
1	I do nt ' want to be one of those parents that assumes my child is a liar , but at the same time I do n't have any evidence to believe it really happened either
1	Even the officers acted like they did n't believe her
1	My 22 yr old daughter lives out of state and in Feb after very stressful things going on in her life , she had delusions of self blame saying sorry all the time   and had to be hospitalized for 2 wks
1	Twice I flew there to be with her during that time , but had to go back to work
1	She was on Serroquel for 1 wk while there , then they changed her to Geodon 20 mg
1	After 1 week of being home , she was having delusions again
1	She called her Dr who told her to take 80 mg daily
1	She is a petite gal and thought that was alot , so she instead takes 40 mg at nite now
1	She is getting better regarding her delusions   but still feels crappy , and hates the side effects
1	She has lactation , really bad headaches , very sleepy after taking them at night , then she wakes up in the nite later and is very restless , anxious and agitated
1	She does nt like that she still is nt normal feeling
1	Her Dr spaced out her Dr appts to 1 month after hospital discharge and she called Dr the other day and will be going next week instead and wants to try Serroquel again
1	She is applying for State insurance but you would think Dr would monitor her more closely with these meds
1	I do nt like her to be alone going thru this illness with no family there , and she does nt seem to care that we are nt there for that matter
1	She moved there 1 year ago and wants to go to college there
1	I am nervous now that the stress of work and college may be too much for her
1	She wants to be independent and get back to work even with her feeling not right yet , She has been off work Feb and now all of March
1	I know Drs want to get her stabilized on her meds
1	I worry about how she is , and about the side effects she describes and also about those antipsychotic meds causing suicide
1	She was only diagnosed with severe stress episode , but I still think she may have Bipolar because it runs in her father 's side of family
1	She does nt even know if her diagnosis is accurate and they just want to medicate her , as she says
1	My ex boyfriend whom I spent over a year with was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder
1	I have recently begun another relationship after over 3 years of being single , and I believe my significant other might have it too
1	My biggest concern here is Am I repeating history
1	I believe that I might have BPD as well
1	I am in college , a single parent and I have rational goals with motivation to achieve them
1	I can recall times where I would begin ' talking ' to someone , or getting to know them And in maybe 5 or so specific ' relationships ' it would turn into codependence , i would really get to like them and get attached
1	We would talk all day long , no matter what it was about , and I would see myself jumping to conclusions as to why this person is n't talking to me , if they were busy or something
1	I have extreme trust issues , stemming from my childhood and past relationships
1	When it comes down to that , I usually begin pulling away even though I want it
1	When I do n't want it however , or I do not feel a connection with the other person , I usually give in to the pressure because I feel wanted and needed and I do n't have to get my emotions involved
1	Therefore , I do n't feel that I am losing anything if it goes bad , I am just reaping the benefits of being wanted
1	I am insecure and I have an extremely hard time completely opening up to people about my emotions and innerself
1	Especially on an intimate level because I have had sexually abusive relationships , and with my previous ex , I was left for a guy
1	Later discovering that my ex had been cheating on me with men in our relationship while I was pregnant
1	I 'm not sure if this relationship had completely destroyed my trust , and is making it next to impossible for me to see people as ' good ' when they begin to act cold towards me or , if I have been this way all along and relationships are bringing out what I 've been unaware of
1	I am also an Empath , and I believe I am good at ' reading ' other people
1	I have learned about this within the last year or so and I believe it has helped me understand a lot
1	Do I have trust issues or do I have a personality disorder as a result of numerous traumas
1	He lives in a camper outside my house
1	All I ask of him is to clean up after himself
1	He does n't think he should have to
1	My bf is a truck driver so he is never here
1	Anytime I say anything to him , he says I am putting him in the middle
1	Jr works in a factory , pays no rent , expects me to buy his food
1	If I get on to him for something , he goes strait to his dad
1	If I tell his dad , jr tells me I need to take it up with him
1	He refuses to wash his dishes , there are grease spots on almost every cabinet door where we has rubbed his knees up against it
1	I bought a freezer , he broke the lock on it , although he was n't supposed to be in it
1	I just scrubbed the kitchen top to bottom a few weeks before he done this
1	He expects me to drop what I am doing to help him , yet if I ask him to do something that will take 2 minutes , he takes 3 minutes explaining why he ca n't
1	The other day I told my son to come in and do his chores
1	Jr laughed at him and told him he did n't have to do anything around the house
1	When he moved out only for 2 weeks   I paid 20 to have the bathroom cleaned from top to bottom
1	I have not told his dad because he is not home , so it will do no good
1	The other day I told jr yet again that he needed to clean up after himself , he replys back to practice what yew preach yeah he is 19 and can not spell you
1	Anyways , I am the ONLY one who cleans the house , noone cleans up after me , so I do not understand his comment
1	I am stressed , I ca n't eat , i m sick , I want to cry , I hate feeling this way
1	Well , unless I get rid of my bf , which I could n't imagine doing , I do not see any way to get rid of the stress
1	I feel there is nothing I can do and I am about to break
1	My husband has two kids that we get every other weekend
1	I feel like they are my own
1	I talk openly with the little girl and try to keep her feeling like she can always come to me
1	She comes to me all the time
1	With questions and letting me know her feelings
1	So situations are coming up that I have a different opinion from her mother on
1	So now here comes my question how do you stay on the sidelines and keep from upsetting the bio parent as one poster once said
1	I do n't want to upset the mother or confuse the children but at the same time I feel so strongly about certain things
1	I love the kids as my own especially since I may never have my own
1	This makes it hard to just sit on the sidelines and watch my little girl especially be so upset over her womanhood
1	I have tried not to let my heart and emotions rule and have really thought things through , but that is getting hard
1	My parent are checking on everything I do
1	I 'm 19 years old
1	I love partying but I also know my limits and I am studying hard
1	My uni is 5 hours away from home
1	Yet , my dad is spying on everything that I do and he calls me and threatens me
1	I have a few senior friends who i enjoy hanging out with and they are all guys
1	But my parents are not happy with this and they 're assuming that I sleep with all those guys
1	Because of all that they know , I 'm finding it hard to trust anyone here
1	Everytime my dad sends me this threatening messages and when he calls , i get really depressed
1	I 'm feeling very lonely , I ca nt trust anyone , and i 'm having suicidal thoughts
1	I do n't know how to deal with my parents when I go home next which is 2 weeks from now
1	I just want to avoid them
1	I love them but somehow I feel like all i have been doing is disappointing them
1	I was in a 6 year relationship with a wonderful person
1	The last 34 months of the relationship he started accusing me of emailing other men , all kinds of crazy things
1	One night , he all of a sudden packs his things and leaves
1	He tells me to tell him the truth , but the truth is I 've done nothing , he did n't believe me
1	This was about 2 months ago or so , we have seen each other since but he always goes into these moods were he feels I am and have been messing around
1	He also has these ideas where he feels that everyone is plotting against him
1	Alot of the things he is doing are almost textbook of paranoid schizophrenic
1	In fact , he says that ' I m the one who needs to see a Dr
1	He has called me all sorts of names and brought up some very personal things about my past
1	My problem is that this man was very good to me , we got along great
1	I find myself missing our relationship , missing him and wanting very much to see and talk to him
1	I do nt exercise as much as i should be , i suffed a hawkins type 3 fracture of the talus last may , and have been in recovery since
1	Lately i have been experiencing alot of fatigue , and when i say lately , its been a few months , and feeling tired alot
1	I cut down alot of caffeine and pop , to almost none , i am trying to maintain a reagular sleeping pattern , i eat pretty healthy , i am always watching that i eat
1	Feeling tired all the time , yawning alot at work , i just ca nt seem to raise my energy level and boost my immune system , i am constantly getting little colds and bugs , which makes it hard to take a sick days because you feel rotten and do nt want to be at work , but at the same time , you do nt feel sick enough to stay home
1	I m wondering if there s a link between the joint pain , and maybe its affecting my sleep
1	I could sleep 8 or 12 hours , and still feel tired when i get up
1	Some days it does nt seem to bother me , and some days at work , i could fall asleep
1	I did have a stressful recovery , and finanical stress which is still on going , but the chronic fatigue seems to be really bothering me , and when i do nt feel well , that also stresses me out , its a vicious cycle
1	I am going to see my family doctor tomorrow , i was hoping to get some feedback on maybe some more questions i could ask him or tests that we could rule out , rather than me just telling him   i feel tired all the time  
1	I m kind of at a loss , because i ve been tested before for thyroid and other things , i do have a bit of GERD , but that seems to have settled down in the last while
1	My name is Hamed Khatiz and I am a sixteen year old student , writer , drummer , adviser and many more from Sydney
1	I would wake naturally at 100am and then again at 445am and then again at 715am when I actually start the day , leaving at 830am to 9 am and being at least an hour late for school
1	I got a lecture from my principal about why I was missing so many classes
1	I am completely missing classes sometimes , arriving at school at 1000am sometimes when I used to arrive at 730 and have to arrive by 820
1	I am demotivated when it was only last season , I was more awake than most of my teachers
1	How do you find the motivation to get up and stay awake because I miss walking to school with my friends on the 800am train instead of catching the 940am full of not so nice people with brown paper bags over alcohol bottles looking to see whether any of my friends are on the platform
1	I am 47 and pretty healthy overall
1	I 've had two surgeries in the past , an appendectomy and a mass removed from my small intestine , but I 've done pretty well since then
1	A few years ago I had an ultrasound done , also , because I was having abdominal pain but they did n't see anything except a large gallstone in my gallbladder
1	This month my period came on time , early in the morning of Feb 2nd
1	Normally , my periods last about 4 to 5 days
1	However , I still am having some bleeding well past when I should have , fluctuating between bright red and brown as if it was stopping but would start up again
1	I am still bleeding and am puzzled by this because this makes 15 days now of bleeding
1	The only other thing I noticed this month was my breasts were extemely painful the week before my period started started out feeling itchy for a few days and then moved to painful
1	I 've had this happen before though not every month and attributed it to hormones
1	I also had one incident about 5 days after my period started around the 6th where I started getting cramping that got worse and worse till I could barely move or breathe , it hurt so bad
1	I 've had cramping before , of course , but never to this extreme and even though it felt similar to menstrual cramping , it felt different and more intense than I 've ever experienced
1	I 'm just wondering if I 'm starting to experience the beginnings of Perimenopause or Menopause or if it could be something else
1	Also , I heard there 's a blood test that can be done to see if you 're entering Menopause but someone told me you have to time it right , so when is the right timing for that
1	Just wondering why my period is not letting up more than two weeks after it started
1	I wonder if anyone has had a similar experience Long story short , I had a radical hysterectomy actually , everything out except the cervix 10 months ago
1	After being on synthetic estrogen Enjuvia for many months and not feeling well at all , I finally found myself a better doctor who listened to my symptoms and put me on the Vivelle Dot patch bioidentical estradiol , 075 I 've been on that for about 3 weeks now , maybe 4
1	Anyway , just 4 days ago , I also started on bioidentical progesterone , 50 mg , in the form of a capsule that I take orally
1	Ever since We d , my appetite which had been severely depressed has been unstoppable   I want to eat everything in sight
1	Honestly , I think I 've gained 5 pounds in the past 4 days my stomach is swollen , I feel bloated
1	In all other areas , I feel great   greater than I 've felt in the past 10 momths
1	However , my jeans are n't fitting me anymore now and I feel HUGE , like I 've gained twice the amt
1	I 'm supposed to be going up to the Dells to an indoor waterpark with my husband and 2 young kids this coming week , and the thought of putting on a bathing suit or even being able to fit INTO a bathing suit is really appalling to me right now
1	I m just wondering if I can get some opinions on this issue
1	I was with my ex botfriend for 2 years
1	We broke up 8 months ago
1	Within this time he was very emotionally abusive towards me
1	Just a few examples , he would put me down about what i was wearing on a night out if it was n't a mini skirt which is what he wanted me to wear , he would call me names and when i d say stop , they 're not nice , he would say I m just messing
1	Of course I d think I was being to serious etc
1	He cheated on me with his ex and with a few more women to
1	I stayed with him thinking it would get better
1	He went away on a lads weekend , I did nt want him to go cause he was just after cheating , I asked him not to , explained I did not trust him enough yet and he lost the plot , saying I have to get over myself and that I was a drama queen
1	He went and of course I felt bad because i caused the arguement according to him
1	He would want sex and there were times I was not in the mood
1	On a few occasions he forced me to have sex
1	I would say No I m not in the mood , i just want to cuddle but he would n't take no for an answer , he would continued to try and have sex with me
1	I would push his hands away and say no but he was just so persistant
1	he would keep going , begging me
1	On one occasion , he rolled me over and started undoing my pants , i said no
1	I said to stop but he said Do nt be a btch Every single time we ended up having sex when i did nt want to
1	I have just recently told my mom about this and she said it was rape , but I m not sure if it is
1	I was his gf and well , must have been my fault cause I stayed with him
1	I feel like it 's going to be this way forever and I 'm never gon na live a normal life
1	I do n't feel like I 'm alive like I did as a little kid
1	I am only 13 and this has been going on for over a year
1	I take meds and I think my doctor is going to change them
1	I take 50 MG of Zoloft everyday
1	Is a possible sideaffect of Zoloft worsening depression , because I see on commercials for antidepressants that sideaffects can be new or worsening depression
1	My mom said it could be something hormonal because I 'm at that age and I have n't even had my first period yet
1	Also I am scared to sleep because I am scared I will die in my sleep and not be able to control it
1	I am so sad and feel hopeless and I am scared to die
1	I go to the doctor tomorrow and I think I will have to get blood work done or change my medicine
1	But I am scared to get my blood drawn because last time the people tried to pin me down and I almost passed out the first time they tried to get the blood out because they missed my vain and nothing came out so the needle was just in my arm for like 10 seconds
1	I ended up screaming and crying and I got kicked out
1	I am very scared to try new medication because I 've been on mine for over a year and I 'm scared what will happen when I go off of it
1	I worry immensely that a new medicine will kill me somehow or kill me in my sleep
1	I want to know how I can possibly get pregnant
1	If you stop right here , that sounds funny , but no seriously , I have had a tubal ligation not sure if I had them seared but I want to know if I can somehow still get pregnant
1	I am 37 years old with three beautiful children
1	They are all girls , however I only have custody of one
1	I am hoping this does not sound like a pity session , I am solely trying to set and obtain a goal of getting pregnant
1	I did not know him well enough before I got married I would have known he had six prior restraining orders from other wives before I met him , but I trusted him
1	Being so familiar with the court system with all his priors , which does not include the 28 violent offences he has been charged with , he is a tough fight
1	I do n't want to elaborate too much , but I was abused and I was pregnant with our last when I was so damaged that I decided I would never have children again
1	I need to know what my options are
1	I had a ectopic with twins about 89 weeks ago they were 78 weeks when they were taken from me
1	Then this week i found out i was yet again pregnant
1	I was filled with joy thought maybe just maybe we will have our second bundle of joy
1	But no god took it from me 45 weeks along and misscarried yet again ' I have been taking preg vitimins and have been eating healthy and not eating abything not ment to eat   i m starting to think i m not built for having babys this is my 3rd misscarrage and my first ectopic that hurt the most knowing i did nt loose the one i lost 2 and had no choice in the matter then to say goodbye to my beating heart babys ' i try to stay strong but i m hurting and crying so much ' The reason i ask if this is my punishment is because when i was 16 i fell pregnant and have aborted people say i m wrong but the reason behind my doing is more then understandable i reakon as i fell pregnant to rape
1	I still get s from my family every day they say that its because of the abortion and that i should nt of done it i should of put it up for adopition or something but not abord it
1	Is it crazy for me to feel like i have dine the right thing yet still getting punished
1	I really do nt know what to do with my life anymorefrom the start , i never really had much self confidence
1	I m a freshman in high school and all my friends would laugh at me when i try to belong with them , and if i be smart , i m labeles as ' the nerdy one who does nt have fun ' but if i do nt i m called ' the stupid girl '
1	i do nt even have a family to help me with this
1	my father keeps telling me that he thinks depression is stupid and pointless and he never thinks i will do it
1	No body will give me a second glance cuz i look very happy on the outside
1	This is also why if i tell my friends they will think i just want attention
1	But my parents do nt really care about me , they do nt know what i m going through and i ca nt tell them , i ca nt explain
1	it does nt help that they always call me stupid and worthless , and that i would n't get anywhere in life
1	Then my dad starts yelling at me saying that if i go on like this there is no point of living , and i do nt think he knows how correct he is
1	i do nt know why i m writing this , probably to help the other teens out thereif you think you got it bad , your not alone
1	I am a victim of selfharm and i ve been thinking a lot about suicidebut i m scared
1	I do n't know where to start but here it goes Ok so my mom uses meth , and I found out when I was about 14 years old and now I 'm 21
1	So my mom has been calling me every name in the book ever since then
1	But recently in the past two years she has physically hurt me over nothing she punched on me thanksgiving last year and I just pushed her off of me cause I was in shock that she would actually strike meand we did n't talk for a while and she came to me one day and apologized to me saying I 'm sorry I 'll never hit you again and I said ok mom
1	So then couple weeks ago I was cleaning up the house and I 'm picking up after my mom , her boyfriend and her 3 kids and I asked her kindly , hey mom can you please help me clean up I 'm gon na have a guest over and most of the stuff that I 'm picking up is yours
1	She replied with   if you do n't like it you can get the   out of my house and I said ok mom I did n't come at you foul so do n't come at me like that
1	She came out of her room and said   do n't talke back to me I told you if you do n't like it get out
1	I was like look mom I 'm a little to old for you to be coming at me all crazy when I asked you a simple questionshe got in my face and pushed me and said   I 'm going to   you up
1	And I swore to myself that will she lay hands on me again and gets away with it I 'm going to defend myself this time She pushed me once more and she punched me
1	I had no choice but to defend myself and I did
1	It felt weird to actually fight back but I had no choiceso I got off of her and she was like   your dead to me   you
1	Your going to see what it 's like to be without a familymind you my dad is a deadbeat father never around My mom is all I have even though she strikes me and always emotionally abuses me like I ca n't believe that 's my mom I thought a mother is to love and protect and nurture but she did the exact opposite , anyways that week I moved in with my boyfriend and I 'm surrounded by love and support and a good healthy environment but I 'm still hurt by all that my mom has done to meI can honestly say I 'm mentally   up Help me please
1	I just want to recover from my past and move on but it 's really hard to
1	So about two days ago I was with my best friend we are both young teenagers we were hanging out in his room I was comforting him because his parents are having problems
1	ANYWAY I was hugging him and he leaned in and kissed me from that point on we proceeded to undress each other he began to finger me and I began give him a hand job after this he began to rub his head very close to my vaginal opening he never penetrated but I am terrified to think that his pre   may have leaked in or that he may have had some on his fingers when he was fingering me I am unsure if he ejaculated at any point I think he may have when I was pleasuring him but again I 'm unsure I was very wet so I do n't know if he did down there for sure but I am terrified I normally NEVER would have done something like this I have Never done something so immature before I am stressing and I ca n't rely on my period because it is VERY irregular I get every 23 months usually and I do n't know if it makes any difference but he is uncircumcised
1	I 'm afraid to say really anything about me
1	I 'm really paranoid , I think someone I know will search my name and see this
1	I 'm 15 , almost 16
1	I 've been bottling up or otherwise suppressing my emotions for about 3 years , I 've went through a lot of emotional trauma as well
1	I was a new student at my school this year for sophomore year
1	I pushed away everyone that tried to be my friend due to me thinking I was n't good enough
1	I grew up with people that made fun of gays , it took me years to finally accept that that is who I am and stuff
1	I 've sat alone all year at lunch , but I 'm so good at lying about what and how I feel that people assume I have friends That I have a life
1	I think about suicide every other day
1	I go through School looking down , feeling worthless
1	This is the first time I 've ever posted my problems online so
1	I am a 18 years old female
1	I 'm going insane because I 'm in pain and I 'm so tired of being in pain
1	I have had symptoms such as Pain on left side of my back Pain on the left side of my stomachrib area Arm and leg aches on the left sides Headaches and sickness together Migraines on the left side of my head Head feels really heavy Extreme headaches which cause me to get very irritable and angry Becoming happy to sad to very angry so quick Drowsiness feeling dizzy out of nowhere Hallucinations when trying to sleep   then after 10 minutes once realising I ca n't remember the hallucination I get from hungry and eating a lot to then not hungry at all and refusing to eat anything My legs and hands get shaky Sweating a lot a night and feeling as though my heart beat is beating too fast These symptoms were on going and then I came across a swollen lump on the left side of my head
1	I noticed it on Thursday and thought it might go as my family thought it 's probably a bruise
1	By Sunday I was in a lot of pain and it still did not go it just got bigger
1	So I went to the hospital spoke to the doctor let her know what 's going on
1	She said to me it 's tension headaches that 's caused the muscle on the left side of my head to tense
1	She prescribed me to take 1 or 2 tablets of Cocodamol 500 mg 4 times a day with 1 tablet of Ibuprofen
1	She did say to return by Wednesday if I am not better
1	It 's now Tuesday early morning and ever since I 've taken those tablets I feel so much more worse
1	With my symptoms I already had getting worse and having new symptoms occur such as Hiccups occurring at least 3 periods throughout a day Releasing gas through burps and passing wind a lot Pain when seeing light if sunlight passes through the window or when a light is on Constant dry mouth Losing the sense of taste   not able to taste what food or drink tastes like Instant sickness and ache when smoking Feeling numb around the body Vomiting twice in one day Although the swell has gotten down I just feel as though something is not right and need all the help and advice on what to do right now
1	My friends and family think I should ask for scans to be taken to stay on the safe side
1	I am going to a walk in centre to explain everything and to ask if I should go to get scans
1	I just want some sort of answers Thank you
1	well i m 6 days past that today and 45 is the longest its ever been really
1	I always get lightly sore boobs , moderate back ache , and MAYBE one or two headaches before my period
1	I got my period on the 22nd of september for 4 days , and supposedly ovulated on the 8th of october , according to pink pad Had sex on the 4th and 12th of october
1	Its the 28th and i was supposed to get my period on the 22nd
1	Almost 247 but if i bend over for more than a few seconds or just randomly , ill get it for a few hours and happens really often
1	Headaches are so often now iv had them for over a week , moderate to severe ones everyday a few times a day , if it does nt last ALL day , Iv been crazy tired but not enough to make me pass out at 9 or 10 even though i could
1	I took one a week and a half ago , negative
1	Then today , i got a negative but it was around 5 in the day
1	I m not sure how far i would be but only around 35 weeks a presume
1	I m going for a blood test soon but i d like to know some input first
1	and i had some brown spotting in my underwear over a week ago , and the next day what looked like ewcm with a brown streak in it , only when i wiped
1	and i few days ago i had some very pink spotting not a lot , and it only happened for maybe 5 minutes i guess
1	hi this a male 24 from India , few days ago i have been to a new city , i took a decent hotel , i have been to work during the day , then at night i came back to hotel room and had a couple of beers and passed out , i forgot to lock the door of the room , it was apprantely closed from outside but i did not press the button lock , so if any body tried to come inside it would open , Is it possible that someone the hotel staff or anybody could have come inside drugged me and raped me anally i am straight and this would be my first time , i was lying on stomach , in the morning i could not find any stains on the sheets and my underwear , I woke up about 9 o clock had bath and had stools as normal did not notice any thing strange and went for breakfast , when i came back from breakfast then only i realized i had not locked the door last night , i started searching my anal area for cuts and bruises , over the day i also found slight blood with tissue paper , no bleeding during stools , but their was slight pain , which lasted for couple of days when i had stools their was also slight pain , is it possible that i could have been raped , i am highly worried of HIV
1	well my wife 's family suffers from bipolor and i know she does to , but she wo n't see a doctor she has times when she is the most delightful person to be around , but without warning she can change with no cause to being the devil in my wife 's body
1	when she has these moments she treats everyone like they just killed her favorite dogshe treats our seven year old daughter like a slaveWhen she has these moments she is always angry if she says to do something everyone had better get up and do it no matter what time it is or how stupid it is
1	when she gets like this I always stay by my daughter 's side cause my wife always goes after her to make her do a bunch of stuff to try and make her cry on purposewhen i tell her to leave her alone she says courtney get your shoes on where leaving hell it could be 10 or 11 at night and instead of walking she will walk just to   me off more cause she has my daughter walking in the middle of the nightone time i called the cops well she made it home before they got there and started throwing stuff and screaming at the top of her lungs i even had family members present , When the cops got there she completely changed her attitude
1	She started crying and told the cops i was lying and she was nt throwing anything or screamingI told them she was treating courtney like a dog and was dragging her around by the arm even the family members told them , but the cops would n't believe me they said these are your family members they would lie on your behalfand they said if we ever called again they would make sure they took my daughterI did n't give me any help or hope she verbaly abuses everyone in the family this is why we do n't have any friends because of the way she is she abuses our little girl all the time she makes her cry everydayI do nt know what to do I ca n't afford a lawyer cause she completely ruined my crediteven when she has no money she goes shopping just to see what she can buy when she gets moneywhen she has spent every penny she has that s when it gets real bad cause she ca nt shop so it puts her in a mood where if you do something that she do n't like she freaks out on everyone and then she takes the little one and leaves dragging her kicking and screaming
1	anytime her and i are playing and having fun she makes us stop cause she does n't want us to have a good relationshipall i want is for my wife to get help , but she wo nt willingly go what can i do how can i make her go how can i make her see what everyone else sees
1	I 'm a highly educated , intelligent woman , 4 year education , yada yada
1	I was in a relationship on and off with a man for 15 years , married for 4
1	He asked for a divorce eariler in the year
1	I agreed , things just were n't the same , he was staying out a lot but he 's a musician and I just was n't handling it well anymore
1	I do n't like to go out and I honestly wish he would just grow up
1	Anyway he decided to have an affair Labor Day weekend before our papers were even signed and sent and taken to the courthouse
1	Of course his affair ended badly , she was a bar psycho that he traveled to another state to see
1	Now we are legally divorced and he is seeing someone else
1	Not sexually yet but he has met her young daughter and her ex husband
1	She is really nice and he is trying not to hurt her , he says
1	Here comes my problem When we agreed to get divorced , I was relieved
1	I was so ready to have the house all to myself and not worry about him all hours of the night , what he was doing , who he was texting and on and on
1	When he told me about the affair it made me mad but also made me want him more
1	The second time he went out of state and he confirmed he wanted to be with her , I ended it between us sexually as I was absolutely crushed
1	Like I said it ended badly with them as she found out he was legally married when they hooked up the first time
1	She is a real basic sort of girl , no muss no fuss , has a little girl and he said she is really sweet
1	Ex and I got back in contact because he was having issues with his car
1	You can draw your conclusions from there
1	OUr love life is better than ever but he is absolutely not ready to stop with the other women and all of that
1	We spent all night together last night , went out , had a blast but he is supposed to go out with the other woman tonight
1	Before you blast meI KNOW THIS IS INSANE
1	I am an extremely strong independent woman , bought my own home , my own vehichles , was a single mother and raised my children
1	I was always the selfproclaimed Idon'tneedaman kind of woman
1	i know in my head it is physical and yes absolutely I need to stop sleeping with him so do n't bother saying that
1	So thoughts other than stop sleeping with himsomething to cause a lightbulb to come over my head Am I just trying to control him
1	Am i just pining for days past
1	I really would love therapy but I ca n't afford it now that i 'm a single mother of two teenagers with a mortgage
1	How the heck do I get out of it and keep my sanity too
1	Waaaaah , i m 17 years old , and i had have a boi that i been in a Relationship for Months going on a year

1	what to do , how to Forget him , or Any HELPPP will be Greatt   i will Appreciatee it ALOTTT
1	I 'm a twenty year old girl who has been battling depression since I was eight
1	As a child I was emotionally abused and at times physically abused by my father 's exgirlfriend
1	It 's been 5 years since they broke up and I still feel the backlash from my time with her
1	My parents are divorced and have never had a very good relationship so I grew up in different households over the years but after the incident I started staying with my mother rather than my father
1	I have began to become very distant and locked away even though I used to be a very upbeat person
1	I had started cutting last year and have almost overdosed on multiple occasions
1	I go to a therapist every Friday but she just seems to make it worse
1	I 've been confronted by friends and family who think they can help but I 'm not able to accept their help
1	I 'm to afraid to open up about my feelings to anyone I know and I am scared I might not be able to stop myself from doing something I might regret
1	I have social anxiety now and hate leaving the house or even my room because of my unstable emotional state
1	I 've started cutting myself away from the outside world and am refusing the help of doctors and my own parents
1	I hope one of you can help me before it 's too late
1	My psychiatrist of 13 years has decided that she can no longer treat me
1	I know this lady is my doctor but after 13 years it just feels like she has given up on me and that she ca n't adequately support me as she does not have the capacity in her work load
1	I have lots of bad feelings about this and I know I 'm not going to be able to handle it when the time comes
1	She has been a fantastic support to me over the years but I just do n't understand why she is doing this all of a sudden
1	I just feel like she used to really care about me and now she does n't
1	Other people say it 's unfair for me to say that as she is only doing it for my beat interests but I 'm just so angry and hurt about it all
1	Part of me says I should just not see her again and get it over and done with , but I know I ca n't do it
1	I 'm 21 years old and in the last 5years I 've dealt with more then anyone should ever have too
1	5years ago at 17 I was raped and it was my 1st time ever having sex
1	I thought it was the hardest thing I ever went threw till I spoke up about what happened
1	When I told my mom she was so caring and understanding but my dad on the other hand was a drunk and knew that if I went to the police it would effect his friendship with one of his drinking buddy 's so pretty much he picked his friend over me
1	I was so young and started to hate him
1	Even when he needed me most   during the last days , he had stage 4 lung cancer   I could n't be there for him because he was n't there for me he passed away when I was 18 years old
1	After he died the guilt got to me for me turning my back on him
1	Then two years later when I was 20 I got this infection that no one has answers for , the closest thing it sounded like was herpes two negative test but I still google everyday because my symptoms have n't gone away
1	I just feel so broken and crazy , I do n't know how to deal with the pain anymore once a girl who smile 247 now I 'm a crazy mess where the little things make me break down and cry
1	My BPD has become so much better since the last 2 years
1	3 years ago I was living in hell
1	Everyone around me hated me
1	My problem is whenever I 'm under stress I get very irritable and that triggers my anger
1	But I 'm not sure if I have BPD anymore
1	My psychiatrist believes I do but I feel calmer now
1	I know that maybe in a week , it might start
1	Sometimes I deal with people when I 'm angry pretty maturely and sometimes I just fly off the handle
1	I 'm almost always never talking to on close friend and I wo n't give in until they show that they care and apologize
1	I 'm lonely and I want to be in a relationship but I 'm too scared that they will be attached and clingy
1	Hence , I ca n't date anyone for more than a week
1	I just feel empty and bored and I have sex a lot
1	I have a bright career ahead , but sometimes I feel I chose it so I do n't have to make a choice
1	I 'd like to know if this is normal or BPD ish behaviour
1	We had a fight and broke up and did n't see each other for 20 years
1	After we reconnected I found out I had a son
1	She was divorcing her husband
1	we loved each other and things were good we did have fights
1	But the kicker was this her father moved in , we got along fine for a few months , then he started taking over the house and pushing my buttons
1	THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL he and I both reached our limit
1	We had a very loud and angry argument that resulted in him sucker punching me and she kicked me out
1	  I never laid a hand on her father
1	I tried emailing and talking to her
1	She responded for a week and then she stopped and asked me not to call her saying she was emotionally   and needed to deal with it , wishing the best for me etc
1	But I found excuses to call and get her to talk to me
1	I went over to her house a couple of times with her permission to get my things
1	And in the process we hugged and kissed each time I saw her
1	Now , she is completely ignoring me I found out she met a attractive younger man
1	I am 50 and she is 43 she is very smart and independent
1	quick witted as hell   after I regained what was left of my senses
1	I sent her a voice message saying that I was going to do the admirable thing and leave her alone , that I want to work things out but if that 's not what she wants
1	I also told her the door was open if she changed her mind and that I loved her
1	do I have a chance in hell getting her back
1	p , s , she is the one who stole my heart and I ca nt imagine being without her
1	For many years I have never really felt happy for long periods of time , I am able to laugh and have fun with friends I have only had 3 time to time but when it is time to be alone , I feel crazy
1	I think of all the things that make me hate being in this world like , my lowself esteem , my past and I even think of the future
1	I think of how I would rather be dead than have to deal with it but another part of me feels like I should try to see the good things I have and I do have good things
1	I really do not think I have much to keep me here besides the guilt of bringing pain to my loved ones
1	I have tried seeking help before and quickly gave up when I realized I can not afford it why would I pay so much to save myself when I do not even care
1	I do not know what I feel
1	I always thought it was just a phase or maybe I have been overreacting
1	I hurt myself a lot sometimes I feel like i enjoy feeling worthlessI can not even remember being truly happy not even when I think of my childhood
1	I do not know what to do the pain almost feels physical like my chest is heavy all the time
1	I always want to cry but I am so use to it that I just feel blank
1	I am not sure what I am doing on this page maybe hoping I can fix something but I do not know
1	I am too scared to die but I want to so bad Can I ever shake off this feeling
1	I am having these pains , you know the butterflies in your stomach feeling But its all the time , and at times I feel so bad
1	It does get aggrevated by some thoughts , I 'm taking a break from school and seeing Psychologist and getting treatment , so please do n't answer with Go see professional help I 'm posting this to see if anyone can POSSIBLY Relate
1	I had a moment in my life where it led to me to the dumps , Mentally
1	I am depressed , I have Anxious characteristics What s wrong with me
1	I keep thinking soo much and it 's just mentally exhausting , Psychologists think I can relate to PTSD Post Traumatic Stress disorder
1	I do n't Enjoy music anymore , it makes me uncomfortable and my thoughts are so stupid , It 's like thinking that i 'm a dirty   or , or when I look at commercials with kids I feel worse and have that thought Again , Like it 's just STUPIDDDD Thoughts , Pedophiles are monsters They should all go to prison and DIE , It 's also like me being afraid of Homosexuality , but in reality , In your mind YOURE EITHER GAY OR YOURE NOT , But it 's just weird cause I love girls , or If I ever went to the Army I would shoot someone on my team Like that , You know as I type this , I recall no Positive thoughts in my present life
1	This pain is like someone is punching you in your bruised arm , again and again and again
1	It feels like I 'm full of food , or a balloon is there , Someone told me they feel this when they 're full of stress dealing with Relationships and jobs
1	I feel this all the time and I 'm only 16 Like the moment I wake up , to the moment I sleep
1	I ca n't function as a person , I have weird thoughts all the time , they 're so difficult to withstand
1	I 'm talking to a cool person that I just met and I think the worst like , me punching her and feel my body just freezing up and in my head i 'm thinking like Omg , Where did this come from , I ca n't imagine my self doing that , or when I m sitting beside a female clerk trying to help me , I 'm just like Imaging at the moment as I speak that I would grab her breast , that 's one example , I 've never acted upon this and NEVER would
1	but I 've never thought like this And when I 'm at school I try to be populare and I 've set myself for failure to get physically fit and it 's just so   Hard to live now
1	It 's like when I ask people Do you have this Abdominal pain , Like the butterflies but they do nt go away They 're like Nah I do n't I feel nothing there , I could probably feel my food If I jumped up or something , And I 'm just like Ahh there 's some hope And Like when I breath DEEEPLY It 's not there until I exhale

1	Was with my soon to be ex for 10 years
1	Was happy at first but the last few years , I was starting to feel unhappy
1	He knew it and I told him
1	We have a child together and she has been handling things better than expected
1	Though I left and yes , found a new person in my life , he has called me many names in the book as well as an adultress , I am stressed after dealing with him
1	I am not going to stoop down to his level
1	He has however , been asking and getting information about the new person I am with and trying to use that against me
1	He has threatened me with our daughter and when she is happy he will pull her aside and next thing I know she is crying
1	He has post bad things about mesure I probably deserve it but he should not bring our child into it and attempt to turn her against me
1	Things went down hill when he slapped me on my birthday in 2006
1	Ever since then I no longer was able to trust him
1	He has always yelled at me and though I worked two jobs and he on disability , I still had to clean house at 1 or 2 am after I get home from work , take our child to the doctor which I am not complaining about but he should go with us and so forth
1	He has used porn in place of me which tore me up over the years
1	I know I am not the drop dead beautiy bomb shell he wants but he did propose to me
1	But what really is bothering me the most is though I am doing all i can , I still supply him money and food when he has our daughter , he still threatens me by saying he going to fill for full custody , yells and screams at me over the phone
1	One moment he is just as nice as can be and the next , he is a demon
1	It gets to me and affects my work performance and my social life to where I just cry more and more
1	My 14 year old son started having problems with going to school half way through 6th gradeThe main issue is that he has had a group of friends since early childhood and has played on many sports teams etc
1	All of them have been on the honor roll all through middle school and our son has not once made it
1	These friends have made him feel stupid for not making it even though he has had good , passing gradesA , B 's and is a good kid
1	He starts every year like gang busters with a ton of confidence only to miss the honor roll by a few points
1	He also had a few teachers that punished him , made an example of him because he refused to wear glasses for anything other then reading the black board
1	We had many meetings with the school over this and they backed down off of this but , these teachers would wait for the chance to jump on him for anythingMaybe a response to our meetings
1	He started to have panic attacks in 7th grade , mid year , on the way to schoolCrying , begging not to go
1	He said my wife and I had no idea what he was feeling and he wished we could be in his shoes
1	Some how we got through 7th grade and had a nice summer
1	THEN 1st term honor roll came out and once again , he missed it by a few points while his buddies all made itHe had a really good report card but it was not enough for them
1	He hung in , had a great winter sports year and seemed to be getting alongTowards the end of winter sports season he began to have the same type of emotional ouburst 's before school , crying , begging not to go etc
1	He said he had become afraid of a teacher that had singled him out
1	The talked to the teacherHowever , I felt that it ran deeper then this and that he was now having problems in the hall way with students
1	We consulted with a mental health professional and they recommend that he be home schooled
1	It has not been all rosesHe soon began to with draw , said all his friends were nt his friends
1	We hired a tutor the last few weeks to help him finish by the middle of july as my wife and I both work and it became clear that he needed more structor in the day
1	The problem has become a lack of interest in doing anything other then video gamesHe has invited other boys from outside his original circle to sleep overs but nothing seems to click
1	I asked him if there are anyother kids outside his old circle and he said noHe loves basketball and had at least begun to attend summer day camps and leagues , THANK GOD
1	We have tried to get him to see a counslor but refuses to goMy wife and I go just to get some helpHe wo nt go to any type of social function outside of basketball
1	He said there is something bothering him but he wo nt tell us or go to see someone
1	His Doctor sent a request to the school to ask teachers if they noticed any signs or social problems or ADDThey all said they saw no problems
1	We have noticed a lack of focus etc,,and the doctor has put him on a med for ADD
1	He has been in it a couple of weeks and we have seen little changeHe is angry now about leaving school and said he wishes he had sucked it up and got through itWe have set up rewards , set guidelines , been the good cop , bad cop over the course of this and it ends in him going to his room and closing the door
1	There is a avoidence to things and it has become a habitIt is a fight to get him in the showerTo go out for pizza , to a movieThe tutor gives him weekend home work and that becomes a fight to do it
1	I have tried talking , hugging , and rewarding him
1	The only thing that seems to get his attention is taking his cell phone away or the video gamesIt has put a ton of stress on my marriage and zapped our energyWe wonder if it is part of just being 14 or if he has anxietydepressionWe have heard that depression meds at his age can cause thoughts of harming yourself or othersHe is not the boy he once was
1	We asked him if he wants to go to another school in the fall and he said NO
1	Sometimes I feel we are so worried that we are causing him more anxietyI fear he will balk at going back to school in the fall even though he said he wants to play high school basketball in the winterIt is a sport that he is good at and can play at a high level then other kids his ageHe said he has no interest in playing the other sports he once playedHas anyone had any experience with a situation like this and how did you get your child back into feeling good and wanting to go to school
1	as the seroquel clears my brain and allows me more and more to see my life and how bad it is all i can think is to give my kids away all day every day i get thru the day and look at them and just want it to end for them , they do nt deserve to live around me , struggling on i really think they would be much better off without me and i can finally end this misery
1	i know many people would be happier with me gone so why the hell am i still here , it seems to get harder every day and noone understands or wants to , so sick of asking for help everywhere and nobody replies to messages or tries to help , its not just me in this there s my kids does noone care about them
1	why am i completely on my own with all this which is so hard
1	i do nt cope in the house or outthanks to my bipolar i tell people in the street what i think of them even if they 've only looked at me
1	all the pressures of being a single parent build up and i loose it regularly everyday my eldests disability is killing mewatching her get worse change into this little person i do nt know how to deal with or even to talk to most of the time and it breaks my heart i just want the best for my kids and i m not it
1	i think i only keep them as i m so scared of the pain that will come after they 've gone , but maybe it will be different maybe i 'll feel better knowing they are finally ok i just wish someone would damn well help me to keep my kids and do right by them they 'll be so screwed up knowing i gave them away thinking they did something wrong but they have nt they are wonderful little angels its me that s the devil
1	i need help but it does nt look like its gon na come think i should just hand them over before something happens and they and up dragged from my arms taken away forever
1	i hate how much pain i m in and wish so much i was nt ill and could live like other people
1	i only want to get to the end of the day without a list in my head of all the horrid things i ve done that day and wish i could take back but i ca nt
1	worst thing is they are the only people on this earth who love me and i just ca nt be what they need me to be , hate myself so much i wish someone would help
1	I 'm only 16 years old and I 'm really scared and uncomfortable right now , I feel like I 'm always suffocating and have shortness of breath most of the time
1	The thought of dying has been plaguing me for the past month , I do n't know if it had to deal with the severe stress I was going through the past month
1	But It has affected my daily life , I always worry and have mixed emotions every single day , It 's like everything does n't feel right
1	I feel like everything I do , I feel like I 'm doing it for the last time , I ca n't enjoy ANYTHING without the thought of dying
1	I 'm exhausted most of the time because I tend to worry a lot about what 's going to happen
1	I have this weird feeling in my lower throat and I do n't know if its a serious condition
1	Sometimes my throat gets tight and it feels uncomfortable to breathe , but it 's mostly the breathing sensation that is bothering me
1	I try to take slow long breaths in and out to calm myself down but it does n't work it just makes me feel like I ca n't and then my breaths either turn shallow or I gasp for air again
1	Please someone attempt to reassure me that I wo n't die or suffer forever because I 'm going crazy
1	I do n't know what to do and it makes me depressed and gets in the way of doing things like my school work or being with my friends
1	I hate feeling like this everyday , these things that are happening has made a really big impact on me , I used to be a very happy , now it 's like I 'm in a small room and ca n't get out
1	My 14 year old daughter I just do n't understand her no more , sometimes she seems 's like a totally different person like I do n't know her I need to know what it is that s in her mind or if she has any kind of disorder
1	If anybody comes up to her she will shout or scream and say GO AWAY
1	and it 's hard , she once said to me the aliens are comming so prepare when they do and her paraoria is way to extream she will avoid walking or going places where they are crowded I feel like she isolates herself , sometimes she says that she feels as so someone is touching her back a hand touching her back with pressure pushed on it or her legs sometimes I would hear her cry in her room I would go up to her but she will only tell me to leave her alone
1	I also notice she will looks around alot as so as someone is talking to her , she will hold a knife in her hand becausw she says she feels protected from them
1	I do n't know what she means by “ them “ she self harms I see the scars on her arm and wrist , when she hears something from someone or the news she feels she needs to investigate it , she says sometimes she feels she is in a dream like for some hours she will think I 'm a evil soul and I work with the aliens and trying to kill her
1	I have been dating this man for a little more than a year nowwe are engaged now , he has a 16 year old daughter
1	it has been an interesting year for my fiance and me
1	I moved in last august and at first his daughter and i got along great
1	Not long after i moved in she began dating this boy who we thought would be like every other boyfriend she had
1	they go to seperate schools and are lucky if they see eachother once a week
1	Here is a brief list of what all we have unfortunately had to deal with this last year Taking a picture of her private areastoring it on her fathers computerthats how we found that
1	We found more flirtacious pictures as well in which we made her delete
1	right around christmas she went to her mothers house and decided she was going to move there she later claimed that s cause she was afraid to tell us she thought she was pregnant
1	she moved back home shortly after she told her mom she thought she was with child because her mom called her   a worthless piece of  
1	who she did nt want in her house that she no longer was her daughter and she did nt want anything to do with her
1	so we let her move back home with us cause legally we had to
1	we took her to the doctor who confirmed she was nt pregnant and by the looks of her blood tests and the ultrasound she was not pregnant anytime recently either
1	she was upset , she wanted a baby
1	That s when we decided that it was her choice to date her boyfriend but it was our choice on when we would go pick him up etc
1	so we told her that if it was conveniant for us we may go get him for a few hours once a week
1	she was not allowed to go to his place due to the lack of supervision
1	reason why it was so difficult is because her mother puther in adult education and in this state a child is to remain in school legally until the age of 17 so they had planned on keeping her in adult ed until she turned 17 and then she would get her GED
1	Luckily because of her age we were able to bend a few rules to get her back into a main stream highschool
1	she would not get credit for the first half of the school year but they said they would allow her to take classes for the second semester and earn credits for those classes
1	So eventually it became summer vacation , she started talking to her mom again , she had what she called an accidental overdose which she was grounded for mainly cause she went into a medicine cabinet for pain medicine in her father and my room which is off limits to everyone , as well as the medicine being off limits
1	she was grounded for a month which mainly meant she had all the household chores
1	she hated it cause she could not use the phone of get on the computer until every single one of them was finished Its been rocky recently with her attitude , she says she has no friends , she s mad cause she s grounded and last week her father and i were at work when she decided to move back with her mom
1	she did nt consult any of us   she waited till we were nt here
1	the problem we are dealing with now are the false accusations she s telling everyone about her father
1	and the fact that with her she took 500 that was to be put into a savings account for her but the money was never truly given to her , a cat , a turtle , a tv , xbox , cd player , and dvd player , along with her grandmas cat carrier , and a few of my things
1	She s sent a few emails to me through myspace   the last two becomming a little more threatening
1	i m at a loss for words and i m not planning on emailing her back
1	she has shown no respect for this family , all she cares about is herself
1	and really my main reason for writing this is to vent a little , and to ask the opinion of someone not involved what i really should be doing
1	since my step mum was very young she has been abused by different people not family just boyfriends and kids at school when she was 14 years old she witnessed a friend of her being shot dead and then a few years after that she married a man who she had two children with but that man cheated on her ever since she left him she turned to smoking pot and drinking alot after a few years she met my dad over the internet and they got along very well my dad fell head over heels for her and i think she fell for him too but its been a rollacoaster ride ever since after about a year of seeing each other my dad moved her   her youngest daughter from her home town to his home town town just before christmas which is about 650klms she was doing really well but the counclers she has been seeing have n't been any help she has been on and off medication for about 2 years and she is just coming off another lot now in the that week she has made my dad very unhappy and stressed all he wants is for her to feel happy again with him and herself she wo nt go out anywhere with him because she is scared she will get jealous of him just talkin to other woman my dad trains every tuesday and thursday in tye kwon doe and he loves it but because other woman do it aswell she gets very jealous and that course a fight between them
1	if i could just find a doctor or someone who can help my step mum and put her on the right medication that would be that best thing ever she really badly needs help and i do n't know where else to turn to SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP HER

1	Hi   I am trying to find out what 's wrong with me and it is hard to explain
1	For a few years I 've been depressed
1	I 've given up with the world and I hate everyone and everything that I used to enjoy
1	It feels like I do n't have any emotions in my body
1	I have been on antidepressants but that did n't do anything to me
1	I 'm always fighting with my girlfriend at the moment and I do n't know what 's happening
1	I do n't trust her any more and I 'm always suspicious of her motive as she has let me down before by breaking my promises that I NEVER break
1	I do n't even think I can carry our relationship on as I 'm so paranoid and jealous
1	I put myself so down and I usually hurt myself because of that
1	I always say I 'd like to slit her throat because of what she 's done
1	Makes me so angry and like why should I carry on caring
1	But I do love her with all my heart and never will I do anything to hurt me
1	I feel like I change moods often and the motivation in my life has gone
1	I just wish I could end all the pain and misery going on in my life at the moment because it 's just becoming too much
1	I m not to sure if this depression but I will give you what I feel like
1	I just want to go back to where I was and the people I was with
1	I worry about what I am going to do on the weekends
1	I worry about where i will be in 5 years with my life
1	I wake up in the morning unhappy about my life
1	I wish I was somewhere else living in another city
1	I get moments where I hate everyone I know and do nt want anything to do with them
1	I am constantly tired I do nt have any energy to do anything , which is why I drink lots of coffee i ca nt do things unless I have coffee
1	Or am i just unhappy person that is just unhappy with my life
1	I kinda have been looking online to find out if i can find any signs of what i 'm searching forBut i honestly ca n't
1	I 'm a single mother of a 2 year old She goes to her dads house every other weekend her dad was molested by his brother for 5 years
1	I do n't know how often he goes over there
1	My question is About a month ago
1	She left here fine with taking bathsActually loved them She came home on a sunday and could nt even be around water with out sceaming It took me a moth for her to like water again with out the pannic attack she was having when i tried to give her a bathI asked him time over time
1	He said he did nt know what happend Well every other weekend she comes back with a diaper rash
1	This last time she has come home she is acting really strangeI try to change her and she fights with me about getting changed   She says she hurtsAnd when she sits in water and screams she 's in pain
1	I was wonderin if you could give me any signs on a 2 year year old being molested
1	I 'm going to be a sophomore in college this coming fall
1	I 'm not that kind of person to give up so easily and I usually have above a 30 average
1	Anyways what led to me flunking last semester I was diagnosed with OCD
1	Since I did bad , I HATE my major so much I ca n't stand it
1	I do n't know what to even major in anymore , and I 'm defiantly not going into just liberal arts
1	There is one thing that I do enjoy doing , but I 'm afraid of it incase my family says no , and that is Journalism
1	I would totally love to do that , but I do n't know if I will succeed
1	I want to be good at my major and in all honesty I feel like I 'm not good at anything
1	ALL my friends know what they want to do and they talk about it on Facebook and how all of them are completing their internships
1	It 's making me really depressed , I just do n't believe in myself and I do n't know how to be confident
1	I feel so down at minute and it seems to be getting worse each day
1	I was doing okish intil Tuesday then everything went down hill
1	I was starting to get really panicky so I decided to go for a walk just listening to music as it normal helps enough
1	I do n't remember anything still so quite scared as I have n't gone like that in ages but my friends told me all that happened so here I go i must of walked and not stopped for ages to the middle of nowhere , then I started texting them and they said what I was texting them was quite worrying and they got scared as incase I did something stupid
1	They both came looking for me and found me , I had cut my arms up pretty bad and staring into space , crying and shaking , still the blade in my hand
1	When they found me they said that I did n't speak to them once or even looked at them that night
1	They took me back to his to try getting me to drink and eat something but I could n't , his mum came down to try talking to me but they said she touched me I hate people touching me and I freaked out and tryed legging it but they stopped me and would n't let me go
1	I ended up in his room , sitting on the floor , staring into space , crying and shaking still
1	They could n't get one word into me , they where so scared as they had never seem me like it
1	They had to call my mum up as I was so bad , my mum could n't get a word into me either
1	And that night she found out about my cutting which I have kept hiden for 6years
1	Well , first off , I have been with my amazing fiance for two years and we have a beautiful newborn daughter together
1	Our relationship is extremely satisfying on all demensions and I feel truly blessed to be able to call him ' mine '
1	He truly is everything I desire in a man and I enjoy watching how we evolve as a couple and as individuals
1	However , some times I catch myself thinking about my ex and how he is doing or if he still thinks about me
1	It has been over 3 years since we 've split and I ve had absolutely no interest in reconciling with him
1	He has tried to contact me several times since our breakup although I 've never replied
1	I was not allowed to do anything without him , was constantly belittled , and found out that among his compulsive lying issues , he had cheated on me via online sexual chattingwebcaming in the beginning of our relationship
1	I gave him an ultimatum to get help or I would end our relationship
1	After 5 months of no change , I ended it
1	I decided to go to counseling to find what was in myselfor lack there of that caused me to he attracted to men like him
1	I also became involved in my church , got my personal training certificate , and stayed single for about a year until I met my now fiance
1	He has been an awesome man ever since and is totally opposite from my ex
1	He treats me very well and is insightful and intuitive
1	So why do I think at all about my ex
1	I m 33 just not realizing how my past affected me i feel like i sabotaged myself and my dreams by lettin my pa lettin my pass sexual , mental abuse affect me i m very intelligent , but then again i m not , i should have more , should 've done more , i m raising 2 autistic kids , i have arthiritis , and fibromyalgyia , my children are my life i love them , and treat them good because deserve it and deserve a way better life then me , but lately i look at myself and feel bad because i m just not realizing how much i let all the things that happened to me sabotage my life , it 's pretty depressing , allways putting myself down even though people say i m attractive , not having much self worthi wish i could get those years back , i m tryin but its so hard to open up to people i m still attracting the wrong people so i 've asked God to take all the negative people out my life , but now its pretty lonely , i would luv to have a healthy relationship but i feel like because i did n't get love as a child i 'll be a burden on someone Can anyone else relate
1	i 've tried the whole dust myself off thing but i do nt know wats goin on one setback or obstacle over another onewould be nice to have some peace 4 a changemakes me sometime wonder if there is a God
1	I am in such a deep , dark rut and i have no idea of how to pull myself out of it
1	I start my day by waking with barely the energy to sit upright , feeling so weak and feeble
1	As i pull myself up and sit on the edge of my bed this overwhelming sense of dread and despair fills me and i just want to cry my heart out , for it ’s another day i have to contend with and struggle through and put a brave face on for
1	I have been diagnosed with Agoraphobia , panic disorder , GAD , social phobia , OCD and depression
1	I have a CPN , psychiatrist and have had extensive therapy but even still I ’m sinking further and further into this rut and things continue to get worse
1	My shrink recently put me on a low dose antipsychotic for my anxiety and I ’ve been on a beta blocker for years
1	I ’ve tried nearly every antidepressant going but my body suffers terrible , disabling side effects so they are not an option
1	The only thing i take that seems to work is benzo ’s but my doc ’s wo n’t prescribe them freely and to get them is like pulling teeth , for reasons we all know but this seems to be like a really cruel joke being played on me and stopping me from getting well
1	My only option seems to be meditation but for the level of anxiety i suffer even this is not enough
1	I would love to try reflexology or acupuncture but i ca n’t afford it and they do n’t provide it on the NHS
1	I have also had many tests to see if there is a medical reason for why i am like i am and all seems within normal limits
1	I ’ve tried to change all the stressful aspects of my life , like ending troublesome or destructive relationships , including my parents and a lot of family and sorted out money issues to help control stress levels , but it seems i have so much intense baggage that even now with my life being calm and peaceful i am a total nervous wreak , with the slightest stress being turned into a mountain
1	I have below zero confidence or selfesteem , do n’t trust myself to make good decisions on people or my body to keep me safe in almost any situation through fear of losing control or not being able to run and hide
1	Please do not tell me that i wo n’t lose control because i have and ended up peeing in my jeans out in public and drawing attention to myself through a big public display
1	Now i look in the mirror and see an ugly , over weight slob who has no future to look forward to , nothing to offer anyone , lonely pathetic fool with no back bone what so ever and is even scared of my own shadow literally
1	I ca n’t even walk to the end of my road and the friends i did keep are getting so tired of me and my illness , backing out of meeting up all the time as i feel so ill all the time
1	I do n’t find enjoyment in most things i use to and i feel like I ’m in a one man prison , all alone
1	SO please i just do n’t know what else i can do to get myself back into the real world and start feeling better again
1	Thankyou for your time and reading this
1	I read this article about a fraternity brother sexually assaulting a member of his own fraternity while he was passed out
1	Some of you might have read about this in the news a few years back
1	At first , I was thinking wtf but then I saw online that this kind of stuff is not that uncommon
1	Here are a few questions I 'd be interested in hearing your opinions and answers on 1
1	If the person does not remember anything , would n't they at least feel something wrong when they wake up
1	about a week ago I almost cheated on my girlfriend of 18 months , I was out on the drink with my friend for the 1st time in over a year I never drink and ended up at a house party
1	at that house party I tried it on with a girl who I find completelty unatrracitive and never will , I was being sleazy and saying dirty things , she rejected me and straight after that I was so happy she did and I instantly regretted it , I love my girlfriend so much she is best thing to ever happen to me she is my 1st love and hopefully my last as I would like to be with here forever , this happened before when we 1st started going out but I only gave my number to another girl instantly regretted it and told me grlfriens strightaway about it and she forgave me , now find myself overwhelmed with guilt , I can not stop thinking about what I have done , I wake up its the 1st thing on my mind and stays there until I go to sleep , I do n't know what to do its taking over everything I think about , I am so scared of telling her thinking that she will not forgive me yet I want to tell her as we are completely honest to each other about everything she is best friend , I do n't live with her but spend every weekend with her apart from the last one and I going to see her tomorrow and do n't know what ot do
1	how long will this intense guilty feeling last , how can i get over it without telling her because thte last thing i want to do is hurt her , please help me its taking over my life
1	CLEARLY MEDICATION HELPS AND PSYCIATRY INITSELF IS VERY MUCH NEEDED AMONG THE MENTALLY ILLA trained psyciatrist can clearly state the various degrees of a persons mental illness based on clear standlines and anyone w n o m practices i m this field are very much educated and the need for psyciatry is very much needed amomg the mentally illAs a person who suffers with a memtal illness does not need a lay person to tell me that I can cure my disease with some silly yogurt and a apple , I am fully aware that diet can comtribute to a persons memtal well beimg but please domt bash the mental community and all those who work i m the field as fraudulent , many people suffer and are often left in sufferimg when medication and a treatment plan and a traimed proffescianal who can help them is far better than tellimg someone they do not need medication to help their illmess
1	I m sick of people who try to pretend they are a mental health professional who clearly no nothing about the mind and what a phyciatrist even does bravo to those who work in the profession and shame on anyone who ridicules the mentally ill and all the people who suffer I do not want to nide from my illmess and I domt need a detailed bloodwork to comfirm the fact that I have a mental illness
1	For just under a year I think I have been suffering from depression
1	It used to be when my mum would go into these terrible mood swings and make me feel bad , and then I 'd start
1	In may I got caught shoplifting , I was so disappointed in myself and so were my parents
1	A week after , my mum said she felt like we were n't a family , that the past 2 years we 'd rarely done anything together , and she wanted to stay with my nana
1	The next day my dad blamed it on me , his words were you see how the things we do have repercussions
1	A couple of weeks after my mum Sadie the same again and she left , for 10 minutes , and then came back
1	The next time she left she did n't come back for four days
1	She came back on a Sunday
1	The following Thursday , my dad was drunk , and he threatened to kill my mum , he also threw a shoe off her head sounds silly
1	He was saying why did you come back , we were fine we had n't really been fine , he did nt know how to work the washing machine
1	He was saying she was pathetic and was laughing at her
1	While this happened I pack a bag , and took my school bag downstairs
1	We left and went to my nanas , called the police , and he got taken to the police station
1	He 's still on bail until he 's due in court
1	It 's been a very rocky road since that night , I had to make a statement
1	My close friends now I self harm and know everything I 'm going through , one of my closest friends also went through depression and has just managed to stop self harming , but that 's because she has a boyfriend
1	I was going to go see the school nurse , but when I got there she had left
1	I have n't told my family how I feel and I have no idea what I 'm supposed to do
1	Last week was the first time I chose to self harm on my wrist area , it 's usually on my stomach or hands
1	I 'm 15 , female and I occasionally smoke when I 'm stressed like recently but its not a habit
1	After so many yers of managing and juggling all problems say on my on , without anybody 's help , I am having no more strenght to goo on and the only reason I still find strenght to fight and go on are mt children
1	I have twoo sons with my husband 9 and 2 and they are my only reason to go on
1	I have made a decision , that I am going to talk to my husband and I am going t ask him for us o separate and eventually divorce
1	But , for the 13 years of life together , now I am at a point when I just ca nt go like this anymore
1	However , every attempt to discuss anything of value to me , turns in the next minute to not important subject and there is my husband talking about something totaly different
1	In the last year my husband start showing very impulsive behavour
1	Now h is Ok and next minute he is swearing , using abusive words and shouting in the fron of the kids and me
1	He never hit me so far
1	But now on two ocassions he threw a bottle of wather at me and a pack full of apple juice
1	Now I am becoming scared , for m and the kids , and although he loves his children , I do n't believe , he is good example for them anymore
1	He tells me to shut up so he does not get angry , but most of the time I spend my days in silence and I catch myself talking to myself things , I would like too tell me
1	Our both children love him , but are also scared of him
1	As I know , he will never listen to me and what I have to say , I am in process of writing a very long letter and let him know how I really feel
1	I am really scared how he will react too this , but I have made my mind and there is no return
1	I just do n't know how I will cope with everything on my own , but even so I do everyhting on my own , so there is possibly my worry that there is no one supporting m mentaly and emotionaly
1	Our older child has been also diagnosed with ADHD and Oppositional Deffiance Disorder and my husband shows no understanding about it
1	He says there is no such thing and he needs a good slap round the year and a discipline But , our child goes to a special school where to teach him how to deal with his condition and We should show him best support at home and work together with al the strategies in place
1	However , when I say something my husband says the opposite and is confusing the situation instead of supporting me
1	This way he confusing the kids , our older son start manipulating the situation and the little one has got the totally wrong example
1	I think this is quite a lot for beginning , although is very little from our real situation
1	This used to happen to me when I was young , by that I mean the ages between 5 and about 12
1	I went to several psychiatrists and I had catscans and such done to try and determine the cause before but there was nothing medically wrong with me , the doctors said nothing showed up in the catscan and nothing was wrong with anything in my blood stream
1	It kind of helped , outbursts and frustration certainly slowed if not stopped , but I ended up dropping the pills because I ended up getting terrible headaches if I accidentally forgot to take them
1	Luckily , by the time puberty hit I was pretty normal , so me and my family assumed it was just hormones that got sorted out on it 's own
1	I 'm 21 now and they 've started up again
1	But I ca n't figure out why this time , it was so much easier to pinpoint when I was a child
1	Sometimes I can blame it on a sad scene in a movie or tv show or if I think of something bad happening to close friends or family
1	Even though as an adult I should be able to control it much better than I do
1	But other times it 'll just hit me for no reason , like a tidal wave and all I can do is just let it happen because the more I fight the longer it goes on and I hated the choked feeling I get in my throat when it does
1	But I worry it might appear in public , the embarrassment and people asking me Are you okay
1	I ca n't control it and it 's starting frustrating me
1	And what 's worse I have nothing wrong in my life , thus I have no reason to blame this on depression
1	I have a great family that I can depend on , I have plenty of projects to keep me busy I 'm an artist by the way , I 've start a new dieteating habits recentlyhas nothing to do with this by the way , the cry spells started months before I started this diet and I 've already lost a couple of pounds , I exercise plenty at least an hour a day , again this is months after the crying spells started , nobody in my family is sick or injured , I get plenty of sleep , I 've got great friends , I was just accepted into the college of my choice and my first semester payment is covered completely
1	The only thing off is my vitamin D , which I 'm taking supplements for in addition to the multivitamins I 'm also taking
1	I 'm not depressed , I have no reason to be and I certainly do n't feel that way
1	The closest approximation to what 's going on with me is a condition a character call Jacuzzi from an anime called Baccano claims to have
1	When confronted about it he claims that it 's a condition that he ca n't really control
1	When I first saw that , I instantly knew what that was like
1	It was exactly what was wrong with me , the only difference is I want it to stop and the character really did n't care about it
1	I do n't want to go to a psychiatrist because I know all that 's going to happen is I 'm going to cry and the doctor will keep asking what 's wrong and I wo n't have an answer
1	And I have n't told my current doctor about this problem either because of the same thing
1	hi all , i 've had this fear of being schizophrenic for a few months now
1	one day when i was really scared my mom called my cousin , who is a doctor , and told her about it
1	but i was only hearing voices late at night when i was half asleep and my cousin said this was totally normal
1	but then the next month i was wondering why she had n't asked me to babysit her kids in a while and i thought oh she probably does n't want me near her babies and thinks that i 'm schizophrenic and hear things like KILL THOSE KIDS
1	i thought it and i know i thought it
1	but as soon as i had this thought i became terrified
1	now whenever i see those kids i think about what i thought that day and hear a voice that says kill those kids
1	i m pretty sure this is my own thought but i m a hypochondriac and my brain tries to convince me that i m really hearing a voice in my head and its not my own thinking
1	i am totally in touch with reality and i only hear this voice when i think about what i thought that day , not like all the time
1	i m still pretty sure that its only a thought but my brain is like what if i m really hearing a voice
1	i am well aware that no one is actually speaking these things to me
1	i just fear that i m hearing a voice in my head
1	okayy so i have noo self esteem , i have spent the last three years with a best friend no longer my best friend who has purposly tryd to make me feel terrible about myself
1	she is superrr uberr beautifull and i m just average with braces
1	and she makes me feel lik poo
1	long story short no time for examples i do nt want to be her friend anymore and that wo nt be hard , the hard part is making new friends
1	which i happen to now be terrible at now that o can barley speak up in a crowd of two anymore thanks to her
1	i m affraid to talk to anyone thinking they might hate me right off the bat
1	i could say somthing supid or they might not like how i look
1	i m major lonley and i feel lik a loser when i m at home by myself all weekend
1	plz do nt tell me what iv already herd just do it , your great and they know it , do nt be afraid , that stuff dosnt help i m questioning myself
1	i do nt know if i m pretty i used to think so untill my ex best friend told me otherwise i do nt know if i act wierd if i talk wierd
1	i have totally lost sight of who i am
1	Hi I am 17 years old and I have not been diagnosed with any mental conditions I do however have panick attacks , I do n't do drugs and I do n't drink , as far as I know there is not mental illness in my family except for my mum who has depression and anxiety attacks and is addicted to drugs I am not in contact with her
1	For a while now I have heard voices calling my name when I 'm at work or at home listening to music or just sitting in my room , I also constantly get the feeling like I 'm being watched and any small sounds creep me out , this is a regular occurrence
1	I also hear music in my head that is not there this does not happen often its normally when I 'm walking to work and it 's like the tune from a ballerina music box that I had as a kid
1	On one occurrence I woke up in the middle of the night and saw someone in my room when I blinked they were gone I could n't get back to sleep and could n't sleep properly for about a week
1	The main reason I 'm seeking help tho is recently I keep having a feeling like a bug is crawling on my face but when I go to brush it of there is nothing there but the sensation is still there , this has becoming more common over the last few days it had happened like once or twice a few months ago but I 've felt it 2 days in a row now and it 's starting to creep me out , I have a cold at the moment But I do n't think that 's the cause
1	It also feels like my brain is constantly racing and I think about multiple things at once , this dosnt bother me because it 's been that way since I can remember , sometimes I also feel sad for no reason at all and I take it out on my friends Mainly but this has become less often as I have started sorting through some problems I 've been having
1	I do n't know if I 'm crazy or what , I do n't think what I am experiencing is normal but I havnt talked to anyone about it because I do n't want them to think I 'm insane , or maybe I 'm just paranoid and making this stuff up in my head I know the mind can play tricks , if u think it 's this how can I stop my brain from doing this
1	Ok so my stepson is terrified of his grandfather and we do n't know why
1	He does n't spend time with him all the time
1	This one time he did spend time with him on the week after that when asked if he wanted to go over he said no
1	he even cried and cried saying he did n't want too
1	When his grandfather came over to see him he did n't even wanna come down the stairs to see him
1	He did n't even wanna look at him or say hi
1	When asked why he said he did nt wanna say hi or talk to him
1	He did n't would n't even look at him
1	We asked if his grandfather did anything to him he said ' ' no ''
1	Ever since that day he has only been with him once
1	But he never wants to see him
1	I do nt wanna think bad things but why would a child not wanna see his gradfather this bad
1	Please give me some advice or help me out
1	I am a 42 year old female with many serious health problems
1	My mother lives with me , she is 64
1	I have my good days   bad days going through kidney failure , infections , etc
1	My question is when I am sick , in the hospital , or having bad times my mother is very nice to me
1	But when I am well   feeling good she is nasty , crabby   horrible to be around
1	She seems to thrive on the attention she gets at work , church , from friends when I am doing bad
1	Needs people to tell her how sorry they feel for her   what she is going through
1	If everything is good , she will come up will something bad like oh my we are broke , do nt know how we will buy food this week or They are going to shut the phone off Why bring up the bad constantly
1	Hi there , about 4 years ago i went to the doctors concerning my lymph node on the bone behind my right ear was swollen and i was worried about it so i brought this up to my doctor and he said not to worry about it and he took a blood test and everything came back clear
1	What i did nt mention to him at the time was the hard round shaped lump next to the lymph node in the indent in your skull between your ear and the back of your skull because at the time i thought maybe it was meant to be there but as i feel it now i know its not meant to be there as there is nt anything identical on the other side and also it does nt feel like bone it feels like a hard lump that just should nt be there
1	It has caused me no problems over the years and has nt grown it is still about 15 cm big
1	I am wondering if this could be a cancerous tumour as it has been there 4 years which makes me think it could be a benign tumour but i just recently read somewhere that you can have a slow growing cancer for up to 30 years which makes me worry it is a cancerous lump as it is hard , immovable and not tender to touch
1	I have just recenty started worrying about this again and before anybody says it is not a lymph node i know what they feel like and also it is right beside my lymph node behind my ear so it is nt
1	This lump is obviously the reason my lymph node in that region has also been swollen for 4 years
1	I m 18 years old this is my 2nd pregnancy , i lost my first pregnancy due to a miscarriage
1	Sometimes i feel like maybe it was nt just that i being emotionally abused and physically
1	I feel like from all the constant crying , hitting , and everything had a little something to do with it but i do nt know i was 9weeks when i lost it
1	Now i m pregnant again i m 11weeks and 2days Today my partner got mad because i did nt want the dog in the bedroom he smells and is making messes
1	So i put him back in he s room and told my partner to not bring him in our bedroom he got mad started calling me names and pulled me by hair nd pushed me towards the wall and was choking me knowing i m pregnant and i basically have marks on my neck and stuff i m scared at times and i do get so sick of it and want to leave but its hard i love him but not what he s become I ve been abused , raped , and everything when i was younger he knowz it but its like whatever i did nt think my life would get any worse
1	Sometimes i feel like you know
1	But do nt have the guts too i want someone to talk too and give me advise and help please
1	I have had normal every 25 days periods lasting 45 days for years now
1	Back in February of this year I missed a period and then they went back to normal again
1	I was getting my period every three weeks for a few months
1	It started light and stayed light for three days which seemed odd to me , then it got heavy and then went away
1	Two days later I noticed brown discharge but not alot
1	I got this brown discharge for a week but only once a day , Then I got blood again for another four days
1	I went to doc , and they did an endometrial biopsy , blood work , and pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound
1	But he said if the abnormal bleeding continues he may have to do a dc ,
1	It is now January 7th and I have started my period last night Very light so far
1	Honestly I am freaking out because I am so used to getting my period every three and a half weeks
1	I also have anxiety disorder and I worry obsessively about my health
1	SO now i m nervous again , worrying that this bleeding is abnormal , I know that periods become abnormal during perimenapause , but noone ever told me that we had to go through so many scary tests during perimenopause
1	I guess what i really want to know is has anyone ever experienced such abnormal bleeding
1	And lastly , I get nervous about being put to sleep , although this may sound pre mature do you have to be put to sleep for a dc
1	I 've been with this creative , sweet , caring , girl for a month
1	It was a major struggle to come together , and based on her previous behavior history , she 's banned from my house
1	extra info ok here are the meds she 's on Topamax 150 mg , Seroquel 200 mg
1	They told me her history
1	Her father accuses her of being high , just when she does something simple like cry when she has a fight with her friend
1	However , her dad told me that this ongoing family issue has been going for over 10 years
1	Her mom is helpful , but I do n't appreciate her upsetting my gf by always saying I 'm gon na leave her
1	She 's told me a good part of her history , and believe mewow
1	My gf is very focused on making sure I do n't leave her she said she does n't mean to cry etc
1	when she feels stressed out and wants to make sure she can express her feelings without me being scared
1	However , this idea of me leaving her encompasses her to the point of her not even being able to enjoy the day with me while I 'm there
1	I told her she 's intense
1	I told her to work on anger
1	However , her friends in her AA group purposely hurt her and she LOSES it cries , tells me Great , you 're leaving me too
1	AND , doing this in a public area forces my handwhich I told her I wo n't tolerate
1	Seroquel is used to treat schizonot her , bipolar , and those who have manic episodes
1	In addition , those with borderline personality issues   I read the Merck journal , and I Hate to think this , but her behavior seems textbook personality issues
1	Her anger , at times , is expressed very inappropriately , and in places where we can not properly talk it out
1	once in the er , which she had permission to go toshe had bad history of overvisiting ers to get meds , her mom called to check up on her , and then she got all paranoid thinking that I called her mom and said Never   call my mom
1	So , I left her in the room to calm down
1	In public , she busts my chops about not wanting to move in with her
1	we 've been together for over a month
1	she 's made sacrifices for me , but I 'm not ready
1	I wo n't get my hand forced
1	She said When I originally had alcohol issues , they said personality issues , but they said that to everyone , just a broad diagnosis
1	she has n't drank in 2 years
1	I 've seen the positive things she has , and how she 's been there for me
1	I also wanna have a better handle on how many times a day she calls me
1	I making it clear I can not ALWAYS spend every day with her especially since she 's banned from my house cuz my family is concerned
1	Honestly , she do n't use me for , car , or anything like that
1	I calm things , but she always says I 'm the only one that can calm her down
1	Though she recently evolved and said I 'm not asking you to be a therapist or sponsor , just my bf and listen and be supportive
1	I just do n't wanna be burned out we deserve happiness
1	I just wanted to post it in this forum , in hope that it may help one other person as much as it has me

1	Hi , my question is related to wether I may or not have Borderline Personality Disorder
1	Before going into more detail , I know I can simply get a diagnostic but i have n't talked to anyone about this because I 'm afraid they 'll either tell me it 's from my head or wo n't believe me
1	First of all I 'll talk about my childhood since after researching I learned that it may come from childhood experiences even though I do n't think mine was a bad childhood
1	ever since I knew , my father was an alcohoolic , He never hit my mother , but he was always angry at everyone , he came back home late and sometimes after arguing with my mother she 'd take me away from home to my aunt 's house for the night , these are the only memories I have from that time
1	He stopped drinking years later , because of a liver disease , meanwhile my 2 siblings were born , and ever since he started drinking again , not that I 'm 19 now , it 's been about 15 years since this last happened , whenever it does , I get this strange feeling , like my subsconcious remembers this happening even though I have few memories
1	As I grew up between the time he stopped drinking until now , I always had a good childhood , my parents both showed me love , I have a loving family and I made many friends
1	That 's why I say it was not that bad of a childhood despite that with my father
1	Since my 16 years , I 've had anger issues , sometimes my little brother 11yrs now comes to talk to me about something and I just act like I do n't want to hear him , I have no patience for him , I just tell him to go away and immediatly as he leaves the room I feel so bad and think to myself ' ' why did I do that ''
1	but I do n't even go to apologize , I just stay there feeling bad until it goes away
1	Same thing with my mother , I have patience to talk to her , she 's the one with whom I share almost everything , but sometimes I just talk loudly at her and treat her badly , and feel bad afterwards
1	I get annoyed by little things , I feel like I 'm always on edge
1	I had a 3yr relationship , it was my first and only   starting at 16 and ending 2 months before today
1	I loved her more than anything , I got too attatched , I 'd do things I never thought of doing whenever I felt like I was loosing her
1	I was jealous of everything , I got so angry at her sometimes , I never hit her , but I 'd grab her by the arm or hurt her unintencionally while trying to pull her to me whenever she backed away
1	We 'd argue so bad sometimes that we ended up hugged in tears and asking why we were like that , this was always like that the whole three years
1	Whenever we argued I 'd feel like I hated her
1	Sometimes I get so sad for little things I end up crying but 5 minutes later it 's like it never happened
1	Sometimes the inverse happens , I 'm sad and randomly have a happiness and confidence boost that lasts 30 minutes until I feel sad again
1	Whenever I think about my life I cry , wether I 'm thinking of good events or bad events
1	I also feel anxious when I text someone , I always check to see if they 're responding , if they 've seen it and if they do n't reply back rather quickly I start to think they ignored me or do n't want to talk
1	I never text someone first , I 'm constantly posting my feelings on twitter and snapchat in hopes of getting attention and if no one says anything I start to think no one cares
1	I have a need for attention , Whenever I post a photo on instagram , my day depends of the likes I get , if I get many I think that I 'm good that day , I no one likes it I start to think that I 'm ugly
1	When I meet someone , I may share every detail with them even thought I trust almost no one and do n't like people knowing about my life
1	I sometimes want love and affection , but other times I just want to be alone and for no one to talk to me
1	I am so sensitive , whenever I feel like someone is backing away from me I feel so strange and freak out
1	I feel like everyone around me might randomly abandon me
1	I feel like people forget me easily and I always feel like everyone 's better than me , whenever my girlfriend at the time talked to anyone else of the opposite sex I 'd freak out she 'd cheat on me or leave me for that person even though I trusted her , or thought I did , and whenever I talked to a girl and she 'd get angry I though she was just being stupid because it 's perfectly normal
1	I have chronic feelings of emptiness , loneliness and I 'm always bored when I 'm alone
1	I only feel normal when I 'm with friends
1	I act differently acorddingly to the people I 'm with
1	When I 'm alone , I have a constant voice   my voice   narrating what is happening like it 's a movie , I talk to myself , but only in my mind , I never speak out loud
1	I had a pneumothorax last year and ever since , in class or with friends I feel the need and fake a pain just to get attention , and feel so bad for doing it
1	do I have BPD or am I just sad for something
1	In addition to follow on from last post I forgot to say that many arguments also occur in the car as partner is obsessed with driving at speed with family in car car he is an aggressive driver and though we have comprimised that he does nt do over 80 on motorway , if i ve annoyed him he will then do over 80 in car knowing I have no control and can not get out if i complain he will often scream at me saying my nagging to slowdown will cause him to have an accident the shouting frightning the children in back , also during last pregnancy following some previous miscarraiges not only would not help in any way asking me to carry heavy items or doing anything to help with my being in full time work and looking after another child he critisized me when i took time off work feeling poorly and when I thought I was miscarrying again and was frightened to use our big heavy hoover called me lazy , he flew off the handle breaking our stuff when I asked him for help and throughout prgnancy i felt guilty for putting my feet up and he truly believes that I am the one with mental health problems
1	If you have been diagnosed with schizophrenia or any other mental illness would you mind telling me whether you had anything traumatic happen when you were youngerYou do nt have to go into detail if you do nt want i m just wondering if there s more of a connection to schizophrenia being a psychological illnessthat the psych has become this way due to an inability to integrate emotionan experience which has been overwhelming and highly traumatising
1	Also would you mind saying if anyone else in your family had a mental illness or if noone did
1	I believe there s different types of thingsillnesses that are being lumped intocalled schizophrenia when i think in fact they have different causesetiology or whatever eg hearing voices might be due to temporal lobe epilepsy , a brain tumor , true schizophrenia etc but most psychiatristsnarrow minded ones would just diagnose anyone that heard voices as having schizophrenia Thanks for your help
1	Hi , I 'm in my early twenties , and I just had an echo ultrasound done of my coccyx region
1	This mass does not hurt when pressing on it , neither does it cause me any pain unlike the pilonidal cyst which I 've developed over the past 2 weeks
1	I remember having this mass for at least 15 years , although I am not sure if it was the same size or it was smaller
1	I 've posted the echo ultrasound picture of this unidentified mass in my profile under the pictures httpwwwmedhelporguserphotosshow735516personalpageid3184763
1	I 've read that sacrococcygeal chrodoma can manifest as a lump in that region , however , it is often associated with pain in the region andor changes in bowel movement and bladder function I have none of those as well as being extremely rare considering all age groups 11,000,000 cases and especially at my age , in my early 20s , most chordomas occurring in the 4070 age group
1	I have a 3yearold and an now 32 weeks pregnant with second child On a daily basis i get up get my son to school and go to school for landscaping from 8a330p Big and pregnant or not i make sure i get up and do what i need to do to take care of my kidsand what does my bd do
1	When i first meet him he had a job and a olace to stay and everything but shortly after i found out about the first baby its like he stopped doing everything
1	He s 9 years older than me but in my opinion has the mind of a 15 yearold Not to mention also after i found out about my son
1	I found out he not only 3 kids like he told me after talking to his mom he had 6 kidswhich he does nothing for either
1	So now thanks to my 2 he has a total of 8
1	The only reason i have 2 is because i listened to the hype that he was going to do something with his life and he came to live with me and i believed we were going to stay together stupid if me to believe i know
1	But we live and we learn but
1	I said all that just to say i m so sick of dads making up excuses for not taking care of their kids while moms will break their neck to do what ever it takes to take care of their kids
1	Even if we were not togethet as a couple you still wo nt do anything for your kids and you kno they need all the things you need to live
1	I know my kids are ok and will never want for anything but i just hate the face that i have to do it all on my own when i did nt make these kids on my own
1	I have been taking antipsychotics for about 8 years and keep on wondering why my symptoms wo n't go away even though I 'm taking the heaviest antipsychotics in combination
1	I am taking Clozaril and Zyprexa
1	Now before I state the symptoms I want to include a brief history of my past 8 years
1	I was send to the doctor when I got caught using drugs
1	In high school , my friends and I partied on the weekends
1	In the middle of the drug induced terror I decided to tell my mom what I had done believing I would soon die
1	I thought I was having serotonin syndrome which was the first thing that came to my terrified mind having read about it the night before
1	My mom immediately took me to the emergency room where I waited two hours before seeing a doctor
1	The counselor came to the conclusion that I had tried to hurt myself because I had become psychotic
1	The next day , I went to a doctor
1	I told the doctor that I thought people were laughing at me at school which was partially true as I was bullied in high school at times
1	I also told him that people were looking at me strangely
1	I think I was ashamed because of my actions and that is why these thoughts were going through my mind
1	I started getting thoughts that my friends from high school tried to hurt me
1	I thought I had these memories in my mind , but they were repressed since the experience had been traumatic , and I had been under the influence of alcohol and marijuana
1	I had a few very bad experiences with marijuana while partying , when I got extremely scaredvery similar to the cough syrup experience
1	I thought I was lucky that I had walked away from the experiences unharmed
1	To continue , these thoughts of my friends having hurt me lasted a few hours and usually went away when I explained them to my parents
1	My parents were very supportive every single time and they still are
1	I continue to have these thoughts that people had hurt me in the past
1	I do not hear voices during these conversations , instead they come as thoughts
1	If you can imagine talking to someone in your mind then that is what it feels like , except that person is constantly trying to punish me for my wrongdoings in the past and now
1	These thoughts always go away and I feel normal , but they happen multiple times a day , every day
1	I kept switching medicines in the past eight years because the thoughts would n't go away and I eventually ended up taking Clozaril and Zyprexa in combination since my symptoms were controlled the best
1	Now after suffering daily with these symptoms I realize that I may have to take these medicines for life
1	I am definitely going to have to switch the Clozaril with another medicine because of heavy side effects
1	This makes me worry that my thoughts might become worse and I wo n't be able to feel okay
1	I wish I could handle this without medicine and that brings me to the point of this question
1	I have never seen what my symptoms feel like without medicine , because I 've had my symptoms only while on the medicine
1	Every time I 've tried to lower the dosage of the Clozaril , my thoughts come back much stronger after two or so weeks
1	Is it possible that if I stop taking the medicine and endure the period while I have withdrawal and increased amounts of these symptoms I am describing , that I could live my life without these symptoms and be free finally
1	I am a 61year old woman who had a hysterectomy at age 40 but my ovaries were left intact
1	My doctor put me on HRT at age 48
1	I took those for 7 years and then decided to stop after all the negative reports about HRTs came out
1	Once I stopped the HRTs , I started with very severe hot flashes and night sweats
1	This has gone on for almost 7 years now and while their severity has lessened some , I still experience hot flashes at least once an hour during the daytime and every 2030 minutes at night
1	I have tried all the soybased products , black cohosh and a prescription drug for blood pressure that my doctor said may help with hot flashes but none of them had any effect at all
1	After 7 years of hot flashes 247 , I am at my wit 's end
1	The only remedy my doctor has for me is to start back on HRTs which I do n't want to do
1	I am 50 and went off the pill about 2 years ago , after having been on it many years with very light periods
1	One month last year I skipped , only to get it twice the next month
1	I do not get hot flashes , but I do get moody this seems to have gotten a bit better lately thank God
1	The thing is this month I got my period and was n't due to get it again for another week or more
1	Last Friday night I got a little light blood and figured my period was coming on again
1	But at work on Tuesday mid day I got cramps and they have n't stopped today is We d and I 'm home sick
1	I 've been taking 3 ibuprofen but they do n't help much
1	Both my older sisters had hysterectomy 's so they ca n't really give me any input
1	I am now seventeen years old
1	I do n't like my home life
1	My parents are divorced and I live with my mother
1	I do n't understand what I 've done to make her not like me so much
1	She 's hated me since I was a child , she even tells me
1	She 's hit , beat , punched , scratched , shoved , kicked , and spit on me before
1	The beatings are n't often anymore , because I 've threatened to kill her
1	Instead now , she knows I wo n't fight back so she fights with me , picks on me , calls me names , shoves me , and tries to start fights with me
1	She 's so mean to me
1	She likes to say that me getting raped was all my fault And that really hurts my feelings
1	She will try anything to hurt me in some way
1	I can stand there and cry and she will just look at me with no emotion
1	I ask for a hug and she says get away from me
1	I 'm doing good in school , I 'm not in trouble with the law , I do n't drink , do drugs , or smoke , I obey the rules , I 'm off medication and trying to do well in therapy What am I doing wrong
1	She sees no difference in me and that makes me feel worthless and no good   Now , I really want to live with my father but he 's not really great either
1	She has full custody of my brother and I
1	How can I convince her to let me go live with him
1	I hate it here and I ca n't really take anymore bullcrap
1	I feel like I 'm going to snap and just go crazy
1	' How can I get her to care about me
1	Since I was young , my mother has n't held a job , kept friends and was always extremely controlling , obsessive compulsive , and I always thought she was crazy
1	She was highly neglectful   I was 10 watching a 4 year old and baby until 2 in the morring , she never puts her highly intelligent mind towards one thing , one goal for too long , she was always in and out of physicallymentally abusive relationships her being the abuser , but it was also reciprocated
1	For the past few years , having so much time on her hands because she does n't work , and my younger siblings are all in school , she has a lot of time to use her imagination to create fake problems
1	She has sat me down , on at lease 5 occasions , to tell me she 's dying of all different types of cancer , or has some other serious illness
1	Over the past few years she has also become , pretty much , obsessed with all types of disorders
1	First it was ADHD , her and everyone around her , she diagnosed them with that
1	She asid she had hypoglycemia , then everyone around her had it aswell
1	She went as far as faking a seizure , buying gluecose and these weird shakes to keep her sugar level balanced , and took vitamins aswell
1	During my pregnany she was forcing me , by telephone , to get tested for it because she thought it was such a serious disorder
1	Doctor 's run tests to make sure that you sugar levels are correct because you can get diabetes during pregnancy only
1	I was tested , and I was fine
1	Trying to explain that to her was not easy , she tried convincing me that meybe I do n't have it , but my child still could
1	We even stopped talking for months because I would n't push a test out of the doctor for my unborn child
1	I told her not to worry every conversation we had and that if my child has it , then I will make sure he eats every few hoursthat it was n't a big deal
1	Her rsponse was YOU'RE GOING TO F UP YOU CHILD
1	There was a large arguement where all honesty was put on the table , then her and I did n't talk for atleast 4 months
1	The only reason why we began talking again was because I called her did n't ask for any apologies she told my older sister she wanted an aplogogy fromme and never brought it up again
1	Well , now she says she has Aspergers syndrome
1	It is crystal clear , to me , that she has never had this problem , it has come out of nowhere
1	She has always been extremely social , honestly a little too social and open with others , she even went to school for a short time for broadcasting , she has excellent communication skills especially when explaining how strongly she feels about something , it is obvious she does n't have it
1	But now she 's saying that my brothers and sisters have Aspergers too
1	She even tried convincing my husband that he has it
1	She bring herself and the kids to the doctor , if they do n't give her the diagnosis she wants they 're the worst doctors in the world , they 're wrong , and she changes doctors
1	Now I 'm at the point where I have tried to confront her about her faking illnesses problem , and she wo n't even talk to me
1	She 's actually disgusted by me and wants nothing to do with me
1	A few months ago , she was calling me daily we live on opposite sides of the country and talking for hours , now she hates my guts
1	Only myself and one other person has ever confronted her about all of her lies
1	Also , past history includes suicidal attempts 9even in front of me at age 13 , in and out of mental hospitals since she was 17 , 5 kids by 5 different fathers , I attended 15 schools without being an army brat , my younger brother who is only 16 has also attended 15 schools
1	She 's always best friends with the neighbors then , all of a sudden they 're the devil basically and she 'll move almost immediately and most likey get restraing orders on them
1	Everyone goes along with what she says because if you disagree , in any way , you 're the sum of the earth abd she will never tlak to you again well until she forgets about it
1	I fear that my younger sibling are in a bad environment because she tries to push these different diagnoses onto them
1	She can also be cruel and mistreat them
1	She does n't want help , she does n't think she has one problem wrong with her that I 'm the crazy one
1	Before her and I began fighting , I asked her how many doctors she thinks she has visited over the past year and she at first said she could n't count , then she said it had to be over 20 or 30
1	She 's got major problems , and I do n't have anyone that can help guide me in the right direction
1	My 16 year old brother lives with me right now because she kicked him out of the house on the NYCA border , to go on a greyhound to boston , to live with his unfit father who has n't been in his life since he was a little boy , then his father sent him out to the west coast with me
1	I fear that my mother will have an outrageous fit next , and probably call the police and say I kidnapped him or something
1	i have a dad the i think malested me when i was 3 my mom and me moved out of his house 2 to 3 years ago
1	since then we have moved around a bit but its been better then living with him
1	in other words he has something wrong in his head that makes him kinda crazy hard to explain
1	but mom says he s doing better well since we have been in the place when we are now which we have been in for almost a year i have found this guy who i have fallin in love with
1	we have been off and on for a year and now we been going strong for 2 and a half months
1	me and him fight a lot
1	he has cheated on every girl he s been with
1	but he s not that bad of a guy he just comes from a really really   up home life
1	but i m always scared he will cheat or do something to hurt me its hard to explain
1	problem 3 i m trying to figure out a way to help my boyfriend
1	his step dad abuses him his mom is an alcoholic who do nt care he does druges to take away the pain
1	the jason who is 2 years younger is his real brother then there s a half brother who s like 5 the younges is his step dads son so he is always treated best and gets away with every thing
1	jason is treated ok he s not beat bu no one pays ation to him he can stay out and never go home for days and no one cares
1	he stayes with me and his bro at my house they basicly lived there till resently
1	but jimmy he never lives there has nt for 3 months
1	the only time mom cared where he was was when she need him to clean watch little bros cook
1	well this last time step dad hit him he ran away and mom called him in as a run away like she really cared but he had court cases for some stuff he did and she was scarred he would nt show which ment she would go to jail
1	so she got him back and had his real dad come and get him
1	she said he did drugs was failing 4 classes lived with me
1	and all this other stuff that was true but still he did them all as a cry for help and cause he wanted ppl to care
1	him and his bro jason call my mom mom and jason calls me sis and its like were a little family but now that dad has him i never get to see him
1	i thought him living with his real dad would be good but his real dad is really crazy he is stuck in the army days and lies and he s a big big problem and jimmy knows but tries to hide it i just feel like i need to help and do nt know how
1	he s never really open up to ppl no more because ppl turn there backs and leave him so he keeps it to him self and hides it and i want to help
1	oh and me and my man have   with out con
1	cause we are waiting on pills and we were stupid and i m scared i might end up pregnant
1	I 've had the implanon in for a year now , and it 's making me insane
1	I had an abortion last year and got the implant put in afterward
1	I 'm unsure if it 's because I did n't allow myself to think about it or if it 's the implant making me feel this way
1	I 've been having really strange thoughts , i 'm paranoid of thinking things like ' kill someone close to u ' , I 'm only thinking this because i 'm trying so had not to think of it if that makes sense
1	anyway i would n't even kill a spider I just feel like I have no control over my thoughts
1	I 've also developed psoriasis , scalp psoriasis which is making my hair fall out and I 've had countless episodes of tonsilltis since then , this is also making me more stressed
1	I 've been such a   to my boyfriend for no reason , I just get angry or majorly emotional for no reason at all , have no sex drive and constant feeling tired
1	this has only been happening since I got my implant , before then I was bubbly and happy and was n't depressed about a thing
1	I 've seen loads of other girls on here describing similar effects to me , it 's really great to know I 'm not alone in this crazy anxiety implant world
1	Please reply with your stories , it really helped me reading other posts on here
1	I do n't know what it is , but somehow I always seem to focus on the bad
1	14 years ago I fell 7 stories , shattered my pelvis and my elbow and I was in a coma for about 3 weeks
1	I was so close to the end , but I survived
1	I rehabilitated and now I walk with a little bit of a limp
1	I ca n't stand it , and I wish it was like everybody else 's leg
1	I think of my best friend , and I wonder why he has it better
1	And I also think that maybe he thinks I tried to commit suicide
1	But , I honestly do n't think I did
1	I actually do nt know what happened to tell you the truth
1	And that s what I 'm afraid of , that people think I tried to do it
1	It 's ashame I ca n't just focus on the fact that I survived
1	I ca n't focus on the fact that I have a kid and a wife and a house and a job and a car
1	I 'm just so tired of focusing on my best friend and what he thinks
1	I guess it 's just the fact that I feel like he won and I lost
1	But i did n't lose , I 'm doing pretty well for myself
1	Hi I was diagnosed with bpd almost 6 years ago , but after reading up on wehat the illness was , I felt rather releived on getting a diagnoses , as for many years i was under the netal health and they had no idea what was wrong with me , and just advised me to stop drinking and it will all go away , which i did and nothing changed , so to get that news made me feel happy and i felt i had finally got what i needed a answer to the way i was behaving

1	I met my boyfriend fiancee now in high school
1	We 've been together 3 and a half years
1	We are now in college and have been living together 2 years
1	Of course it gets better , and worse A week into our relationship , he sprayed my eye with mouth wash just for fun
1	My eye burned for an hour
1	He said he did n't know why he did it
1	3 weeks in he pushed me in front of my family and I nearly fell into a pool , because I did nt go to him right when he asked
1	A few months later we decided to have sex for the first time
1	I then learned of his porn problem
1	Even though I was one of the most sought after females in my high school , i was n't good enough for him
1	He never complimented me , always insulted me and expected me to be like the ' porn stars
1	He wanted to make me ugly for some reason
1	He would n't let me show my legs or arms
1	He threatened every guy that complimented me in any way
1	Eventually he got rid of the porn but by the first year , he was regularly abusing me physically
1	Punching me , kicking me , slapping , choking
1	I constantly had bruises , sores on my scalp , scratches After high school , he got a job and got us our own place
1	He is very hardworking , responsible , and refused to let me have a job because he was determined to take care of me and give me evrything I want
1	I do the all the housework and do everything he asks , and still he says all the time I 'm worthless and that I do nothing for him
1	I offer to get a job , even if I have to walk , and he wo n't let me
1	He says it 's his responsability to work and take care of me
1	Yet every chance he gets , he throws back in my face that I do n't work
1	Meanwhile he abuses me everyday still
1	One incident my face was so bruised , I could n't leave the house for a couple of days
1	Another time he pushed me into the edge of a desk and cut through my leg muscle
1	I still ca n't walk properly and it 's been over a year
1	By the end of two years I decide to tell someone
1	I told his best friend
1	Which was a mistake because I learned the guy had feelings for me and was then determined to take me away from my situation when all I wanted was advice
1	I fell in as well , and considered leaving with his best friend
1	I had an obligation to my boyfriend who had done so much for me
1	Their friendship fell apart , but I did nt leave him
1	We got two dogs , we share one carnow I feel like I 'll never leave him
1	My parents have no room for me and refuse to let me stay with them because I 'm not a child anymore , I have no place to go
1	He is my food and shelter provider
1	Without him I have absolutely nothing
1	6 months ago he proposed , with a very expensive diamond ring
1	I do love him , I had no choice but to say yes , hoping that he changes one day
1	He abused me again today , which is why I 'm writing
1	I want to leave but I have nowhere to go and no money or car or job experience
1	My 15 year old daughter Is what I believe a really huge risk factor I am scared of my daughter
1	She is very violent and gory and If she gets Introuble with other kids she wo n't stop fighting till she see 's blood
1	Her mood changes alot I 'd say Her mood changes 38 times In a day and when she turns personality she will hit scratch and bite
1	She does n't like a particular girl she 's been holding a grudge against her for 2 years
1	Her teachers have told me she can work well one day and she wo n't work hard the next day she 'll be disruptive and say horrible violent stuff
1	I spoke to her one night , she said she feels things on her body like a million small bugs on her and if so somebody was touching her arm back or leg , she says she has scary thoughts , thoughts that can over power her
1	She feels very paranoid and she says her thoughts go crazy like really fast
1	She feels that everybody knows about her and there going to get her
1	Sometimes she feels like she Is In a movie or people are making a tv show based on her with her everyday life she feels constantly watched and laughed at
1	Sometimes she will think she has special powers like spiderman or a character she likes to call herself who is stretcher girl
1	She finds it difficult to stay with her friends for a certain amount of time like she has to seperate from them and sit by her self In a corner or somewhere quiet or dark
1	My 29 year old daughter has had mental issues since she was 13 , first diagnosed with depression , then substance abuse , many hospitalizations for suicide attempts , and
1	She has neve stuck with any therapy , and she is aself mutilator , with many failed relationships , unable to finish college or keep a job
1	Too many times in the hospital to remember and she has been committted to a state institution , in 2 different state , twice , and going on her third time
1	In November she started to have seizures , tonicclonic , partial , and fairly requently
1	The neurologist who saw her , after all the standard testsCAT , EEG , MRI , said there was no smoking gun , no reasons for the seizures , and he put her on dilantion because she did n't have any insurance , and this is cheap and this works ok She went back to him one more time and then quit going because he was such a jerk
1	She started cutting again which she had n't done in almost three years , and she hospitalized herself the first part of Feb
1	I wanted her to have some kind of a neurology consult but she never did , and they changed her depression meds from Cymbalta to Luvox bc she was having thoughts to hurt herself
1	She was in the hospital a week , got out and was sad and depressed and six nights later in a blackoutseizure flushed all her meds and cut herself all on her inner thigh
1	We placed her back in the hospital , all this time I 've meant psych hospital , and while on the acute ward where patients are watched every 15 minutes , she flatten the backs of some earrings and sliced up her wrists
1	The docs told her she nearly got it right and that she really planned it , around the times when the watchers were coming , talking to them when they did so that they would nt come and physically check her out
1	After this incident she spent 8 days with 24hour care
1	She had 2 days in the ' normal ward and they sent her home
1	My husband and I had a meeting with her , the social worker and RN case manager , and one of the things we decided was that we would keep her medicines when she got home , since she flushed all her meds during a blackoutseizure
1	They have also started her on 10mgs of Valium , 3 times daily , Keppra 2xs daily and Lamictal,200mg,1 xdaily for seizures , and Luvox
1	She comes home and her behavior swings are constant
1	She flies into a rage over everything , especially towards the evening
1	On Wednesday she wanted her pills and I would n't let her have them and she had a major rage
1	She did settle dowm and later that night I was taking her bathher father was out
1	She started screaming at me and banging on the bathroom door saying she was going to break it dowm if I did n't give her her pills
1	The door has a large mirror on it and I was afraid she was going to break it
1	I had my cell phone with me and when she said she was going to tear my room up I told her I was going to call the police
1	That stopped her somewhat , but I later found out that she had taken dramamine , about 50
1	Thursday night she got made about something else , i ca n't remember
1	When I got up at 530 I saw a not from her where she said she was so sorry and that we did nt deserve this , When I looked at it again about 15 minutes later I saw that she had writted the music she wanted at her funeral
1	Iran to her room and she had sliced her right wrist and had it in a pan of water
1	We immediately took her to the ER where we spent about 5 hours , 14 stitches in her wrist and 10 stitches in her thigh
1	The hospital social worker had contacted the pysch hosp , that is connected to the hospital where she had been , and her doctor there asked had we thought about committment to the state mental hospital for long term care , and we agreed to talk about it
1	At 130 Frid morning we were called that our daughter had hung herself and an ambulance was taking to the main hospital
1	We got there before the ambulance , and when she arrive we thought she was dead
1	Dr , in ER said later he though she was brain dead
1	Petachie covered her face , wo n't say more , still a nightmareShe had a grand mal seizure , they do n't know if it was from anoxia
1	She was put in ICU and came around on Saturday , getting upst and would not see neuro doc , wanted pain pill , would n't have MRI until she 'd had 2 injections of valium , got made nurses bc docs did n't order sleep meds , mad at us , usually me
1	On Sunday they were moving her back to psych , hosp
1	Got very upset at one of her sisters who called her and that led to a tirade , through us out of the room , she had a panic attack , gave her xanaz
1	She let me come in , and told me she was n't going back to other place , she wanted to die , she was going to die , she was n't ever going back to state hosp
1	Very paranoid thoughts about people hurtung her , and when she tries to sleep she has to have meds bc all she can think of is old men raping her
1	she tried to run and a security guard got her ,
1	Her last words to me were I hate you
1	She 's the middle of 5 children , 3rd of 3 sistersShe easy going , laid back , not very active but loved to be with her friends and family
1	She had mono at 13 that turned into monohepatitis and she was sick for 2 years and was in and out of school
1	She was diagnosed with Epstein Barr virus at 19 , and antibodies to CMV were found in her blood
1	As a baby and til about seven she was chronically ill with ear infections , have 7 sets of tubes , tonsils out , adnoids out twice , and at age 5 hafe some strange virus where she ran a low grade fever about 3 months and we had to pull her out of school for two month to get her well enough to have tonsils out
1	Well , now she knows that we 're thinking about committing her and she refusing to go
1	She needs so much help but for now this is all we can do to keep her safe
1	We 're trying to get her on Medicaid She needs treatment for the BPD , she had just gotten into a program at out state Medical School Hospital for BPD and selfmutilators but she is not stable enough to be at home
1	She is such a good person somewhere inside all this , and I feel the seizures have somehow triggered something
1	Oh , she 's also had three shock treatments in the last 2 weeks
1	I am from Greece so sorry for my english
1	I am 21 years old , female
1	I have been overthinking things since I was 3 years old
1	I 've always had fears and obsessions when I was a child from 3 to 12 years old I was afraid that burglars would break into our house at night , I was terrified about dying , I was afraid that my parents would n't pick me up from the kindergarten or that they would leave me forever , someone told me that saying candy man 5 times in front of the mirror I would summon the devil and he would kill me so for years I had been trying to hold me from thinking it and instead I 'd been thinking it much more
1	I do n't remember any similar fearsobsessions during middle school and high school years , but since the 12th grade I have been tortured by anxiety , hypochondria which is my main issue I 'm occasionally afraid that I have cancer , hiv , leukemia and mental diseases and doubts about reality whether the world we are living in is real , if there is life after death , if I believe that the world is real but I am crazy and the real world is completely different than what I seeI had been ok for some months but last week , my boyfriend 's best friend was diagnosed with schizophrenia and since then I have been wondering all day and night If I have it or if I 'm going to have it too
1	While trying to figure out if I 'm sane or not I have recalled some moments of my life where my behavior was kinda weird eg
1	many times that something unexpectedly goodweirdnot normal happens to my life I question whether it really happened and I need to somehow confirm itand another one on our first date with my boyfriend , while we were kissing I was seeingimagining patterns and colours like i was dreaminglike when you close your eyes after smoking pot the only logical explanation I can give is that his kisses relaxed me so much that I was in a state between sleep and being awake
1	I have discussed some of those issues with my parents but they say I 'm perfectly fine , cause everybody makes these thoughtsquestions his sanity now and then and especially intelligent people , so it is something completely normal
1	They also say that people who do n't have hobbies and do pretty much nothing in their everyday lives , have plenty of time to think about these things , while others that have more important problemsthings to do do n't they are kinda right cause I do n't have a hobby or do anything special during the day except going out with friends , eating , sleeping and spending time on the internet they believe that I am perfectly sane just because I doubt my sanity they say that insane people have no idea about their problem and they think that the people around them are crazy and that nothing is wrong about themselves
1	What I would like to know is Are there other people who feel the same way as I do
1	Is it my anxiety and hypochondria that causes all these questions or do I have indeed a serious problem
1	Thank you so much for your time
1	in February 2012 I lost my only son
1	I do n't have a family physician I go to a walk in clinic
1	My physician their life been saying for several years put me on a 60 milligram dose of Prozac day
1	Recently in the last few months I have started experiencing severe anxiety and panic attacks
1	I 've gotten to where I cry at the drop of a hat I have bad nightmares and my brain just does not stop
1	I know that I am grieving over my son
1	But I also feel like I 'm losing control of myself
1	A friend of mine gave me a couple of one milligram xanax recentlyI am concerned about asking my physician for a prescription because I do n't want her to think that I am trying to put away the pass I just want to be able to relax a little
1	I am not used to taking prescription but I do realize that I am in need of some type of help
1	Hi my name is Bryan , and I suffer from schizophrenia and I 'm also bipolar
1	My family does n't know what to say anymore they just sit and say nothing whenever my mental problems is aggravated
1	I guess because that when they do say something I usually do n't like it and it turns into a wicked fight
1	I 'm afraid I 'm getting to where I want to pull someone down with me whenever I hear voices or have huge mood swings
1	They are all online so I have a hard time trusting them
1	I say I hate god because if I do manage to live my full life without hurting myself god during judgement day will send me to a firey hell of a bottomless pit if I do n't change , or at least according to my grandmother on my mother 's side
1	I 'm on 30 mg of Zyprexa and it 's making me eat a lot more food than I need so it 's making me gain weight
1	I try to not eat a lot but it 's really difficult since whenever the mood swings and the voices are gone I 'm in a deep depression and that makes me turn to food for comfort , but the feeling is only temporary
1	I 'm afraid if nothing changes I will attempt suicide again
1	I 'm also having trouble with violent thoughts such as if I 'm mad at a person or if I 'm having paranoid thoughts about people that might be making fun of me I always picture myself pulling out a handgun and blowing someone 's brains out or pulling out a knife and stabbing them to death
1	I 'm worried that if someone says the wrong thing to me I will eventually snap and hurt or kill someone
1	These violent thoughts have been going through my head for several months now
1	If I 'm talking to someone that I like and if that outcome or their reactions does n't go the way I like I overanalyze the situation and then just think to myself , he or she thought you were a loser and etc
1	I 'm 16 yo male like 510 180 pounds
1	I hate the way I look iv talked to some people and theyv said I 'm a good looking guy but I do nt belive it
1	I 'd like honest girls opinions but any way I think I 'm fat but my old boss said girls Arnt as consernd with looks as guys are but more into the relashion ship ect is this true
1	I had the hotest girl freind in the world last year and every time we were together I was so nervious and scared she wanted sex several times but I 'm so self consious about the way I look and all I could think about was what dose she see in me
1	I ended up screwing it up cause I 'm a shy kid and she s a happy energetic kid I miss her so much I want2 cry And kill myself she was my first kiss
1	Also I 'm heading down a bad road with drugs quickly I 'll try anything to get high I steal for drugs and I recently started shooting Oxys with little care for my health I severly messed up my hand last night stabbing all the veins I could find cause I ca n't seem to dialate one in my arm
1	I guess the scariest thing is that I just do nt care life means nothin to me but drugs and guitars and rock n roll Iv thought about scuicide countless times and considering it soon All I want is drugs and my girl back
1	Last Sunday , I picked my 3 12 year old up from a visitation weekend at her father 's house
1	Her father has a 15 year old brother , who has been baker acted for self mutilation and drugs
1	My exmotherinlaw said my daughter had n't had a bowel movement all weekend which is unusual for her
1	When I got her home , I gave her some children 's lax and put her in the tub to relax
1	I was drying her off , got to her tush and she screamed at me again , DON'T TOUCH ME , IT HURTS
1	I told her I had to check her butt for poop , and she told me to do it gentle , it hurts
1	I did , and she still screamed how it hurt
1	I asked her what was wrong and if someone touched her
1	She said yes , and when I asked who she named her father 's brother
1	I reported it , but the detective on the case did n't take me seriously , even though my daughter told him what happened
1	He told me that her statements are not qualifying because of her age
1	I am still expected to bring her to that house , where her father has n't called to check on her and no one believes it happened
1	To me , for a 3 year old to state that , and restate it 3 days later , that says something
1	I am a 34 year old male
1	About 3 months ago I noticed a lump in my left armpit , it was only noticeable to the touch , not visible
1	I ignored it because my family had been sick , and I figured swollen lymph node
1	I also have dropped about 30 lbs without any significant effort in the last 6 months , not sure if this is related , but a data point
1	I saw my PCP about 2 weeks ago
1	He also referred me to a general surgeon after the ultrasound was complete
1	Also , last night I found another lump , not nearly as big , just above the first rib in the same side that is tender to the touch
1	My wife and I are a little worried and trying to find out if we have any reason to be
1	Over the past 14 weeks I have become progressively more unwell
1	I had a cough viral broncho at the beginning of April which hung around still have a bit of a cough and sinus congestion now Mid April I noticed my big toes was numb I though a bad fitting shoe had caused this but the numbness and pins and needles began to spread up my leg to my knee and then my hipbottom , back and now arms , hands and head   this has taken about 810 weeks
1	I am booked in for an MRI brain and neck scan on Monday   I have had a lumber MRI which did n't really show any abnormalities
1	But the more I reserach and look I see that my symptoms could be lots of thisCandida , Post Viral Stress , Menopause
1	I am of course beside myself with worry and feeling like I am loosing it
1	I am taking vitamins and minerals day and night I have honestly spent 1000 on supplements Thank you in advance
1	I am 46 years old and untill 14 weeks ago very fit and healthy , loved exercise and loved my job   but now even getting out of bed is an effort
1	I have joint pain , a completly dea right foot , hypo sensitive right led , buttock , back and now pins and needles in both arms and hands , face , head   it feels like a swarm of bees are living inside of me
1	Growing up I thought i was gay , i am 19 , I would block it out for a long time then I would remember that I was gay
1	I came out when I was 18 , I was in a situation with my two friends and their friend josh , josh new I was gay and at one point we were separated from my other friends , he asked if he could kiss me and I started to have a panic attack but kissed him and when my other friends came back I made the one promise not to leave me alone with him
1	I felt like i was powerless and could n't say no
1	I also question if i am gay because I joined a dating website and whenever someone has an interest in me I disengage and avoid them
1	I have a memory of me being young and awaking to someone having my underwear down and I asked them what they were doing and they told me to go back to bed
1	I also remember being awake at night and just staring at this digital clock in a dark room
1	The other night I had a dream that I was little and this man was chasing me when I was on the floor and he just grabbed me and put his finger in my butt
1	I also can not stand affection or when people comfort me and touch me and I am wondering if this is why
1	I think it may have been my uncle who killed himself when I was young which could be why it 's hard to remember since it would of possibly stopped then
1	My mom told me this story how I was at the grocery store with him once and he got mad at me and told me to just shut up , and I demanded he took me home , this must of been when I was around 5 or younger
1	Looking back on that story I just think the relationship we had was suspicious
1	me being alone with my uncle
1	I also have a very weak defense whenever an older person yells at me i break down and have a panic attack and ca nt breathe
1	Hello , I recently turned 37 years old and I have begun to hear voices
1	The are not talking to me or at me , it 's just sort of gibberish that lasts for a split second and then stops , sometimes it can be a tiny piece of a song I do n't recognize as well
1	There is no history of Schizophrenia in my family and at first I thought I was too old to show symptoms , but now I 'm not sure
1	Let me fill you in on a few other things that are going on I have been under a great deal of stress lately and have not been sleeping well
1	I 'm having trouble keeping my mind focused , at some moments it feels like my thoughts are racing and at other moments , my mind just goes blank , I 'm struggling for words and thoughts , I have trouble remembering simple things and most of my day I feel like I 'm on autopilot , just kind of floating through my day physically while stuck in my own head over what could be wrong with me
1	I can fall asleep almost any time I relax but I can not stay asleep for very long and will wake up several times an hour for a few seconds at a time
1	Please help me , I need some answers
1	Hello , so I just Google a few words and found this website
1	Here 's my story and I would like some advice if you could help
1	I got married at the age of 15
1	It was verbal at first then it was where are u going , who where u with , why are u 2 minutes late , I worked and at every job I had ever had
1	6 years later came our first child then 17 months our 2nd
1	I was 9 months pregnant when he was at work one day to help a lady on the highway and a suv smashed in into the car he was pushing
1	when I got the call to go to the ER I found out that he had several injuries
1	He had to have intensive rehab I had our 2nd child without him there
1	One day he got upset with me and hit me with his crutches
1	I call the law on him he went to jail
1	Said he would change , and he did then we had yet another child
1	One day I said enough was enough so I took my kids went to my parents too almost all the money out of the bank
1	Told him I was done
1	He called me over and over saying he was going to commit suicide
1	I prayed for him then my sister calls him mistakenly and she got him to go on a men 's retreat
1	He went I even supported him through it
1	That did n't last here I am 1 year later called the cops yet again got a protective order against him he can have supervised visits with his kids , this weekend was his and he was worried about me and what I am going to do and now I 'm here with my kiddos when it was his turn
1	Now I do love this man and yet again he says he is changing
1	He actually is going to counseling stop drinking and smoking , sent me flowers to work , he is trying
1	Do n't get me wrong I love this man I have only known him
1	I took everything from him
1	Me and the kids are in the house I have my own car I still work and my support group right now are my parents
1	I am scared because I do n't want him back but I do n't want him to hurt
1	I am a 26 year female who is gay
1	I fell in love with a 26 year old female who is straight and married and she fell in love with me regardless
1	we live approximately 7 hours apart and during the past year we were involved saw each other multiple times
1	when the relationship began and I realize I had fallen for her I was engaged to another women who I ended it with because I did n't think it was fair to her and it upset my new love interest
1	I was n't ok with my new love interest being married and it went against all of my morals and beliefs but I proceeded anyways and followed my heart
1	the first time I saw her I fell a million times harder and she fell for me a million times harder
1	we began arguing more often because I did n't want to be apart and I did n't want her to remain married and still pursing me
1	so after a few months of struggling but still seeing each other and it being the same as it was the first time I stopped hinting I wanted her to give me 100 and asked her to leave him and be with me
1	she thought about it for a few months and later said no
1	a month and a half ago she came clean to her husband and she claims told him everything which includes saying things like she has never like she has about me for anyone else
1	during this time of arguing I had also lied to her about talking to my ex fiancé still
1	the conversations were innocent and I never had any sort of feelings for her after I fully gave myself to this new girl
1	I apologized and continue to apologize everyday because I know I made a mistake and another bad judgement the first being getting involved with a married women
1	she knows that I feel bad deep down and still continues to say incredibly hurtful things about it and has brought me to tears numerous times
1	it bother her so much when my ex were would message me or call me and I would n't answer
1	I was with my ex fiancé for 12 years and during this time she also was n't just my fiancé but my best friend and it was incredibly hard to let her go
1	because she is straight and has made a decision she is constantly telling me everytime I bring it up I 'm trying to change her and she is n't gay
1	I have sent her a few things to read with people who had similar experiences to her to have her try and talk to me about it but anytime the subject of us gets brought up she gets extremely angry and threatens to say goodbye and leave my life
1	in fact she has said the subject is to never be discussed ever again or she is leaving for good
1	the last time we discussed the subject she had told me she is no longer in love with me and she stopped the moment it clicked that I was a female
1	that is by far the most painful and hurtful thing I have ever heard in my entire life
1	It makes me feel like complete crap that someone who was suppose to be in love with you could just stop in an instant and something they swore in the beginning of the relationship did n't matter my ex fiancé was very insecure about it and would n't tell anyone what we truly were
1	it is incredibly difficult that now it does matter and it is incredibly hurtful for me that the love we once had that I believed our love transcended all boundaries
1	it is incredible hard because she is constantly yelling at me and getting angry for everything I do or say and being upset and being hurt by the entire situation
1	during this time I have n't been angry and when she is angry I try my hardest to just be nice and calm and I usually spiral into getting very upset and emotional
1	I do n't know what to do anymore , we are talking now as friends but everytime I say something like oh ok or yea she gets angry , whenever I 'm upset she gets angry , I do n't talk about the most important thing in my life to me because she gets angry and wo n't talk about it
1	I 'm at a loss of what to do because when we are talking as friends it does feel like sometimes there is more than that
1	we continue to text all the time and spend the night texting when she is at home with her husband
1	I just am so hurt that someone could just fall out of love in a second when I did n't feel like that was ever possible and it makes me feel like crap that when I 'm trying my hardest to save things it could happen
1	I know the solution is mine and mine alone , but I 'd appreciate some outside perspective
1	Almost seven years ago I married my husband
1	At the time he was working a great paying job which required him to travel for eight weeks at a time
1	Prior to starting this job , and for the duration of our dating life , he had bounced from job to job , never staying anywhere for more than a few months
1	It was only after I threatened to leave him and kicked him out of our apartment that he found a good jobAfter getting married , my husband once again quit his job
1	At the time , and being all of 23 , I did n't really have a problem with this , as it seemed he was going to eventually do the correct thing
1	I kick myself almost constantly for that decisionFlash forward a few years and I 'm working full time , and work in retail part time
1	No I did n't try to stop him , again I was just too dumb to think he would n't follow through with what he said
1	Needles to say , the business failed and we were in financial ruinEventually my husband went back to the company he was with when we got married and we got out of the hole we were in
1	I went back to just just working one jobNow to the beginning of the end
1	Things went smoothly until 2012 and we even took a couple vacations together
1	Suddenly , my husband decided to quit his job , claiming he was about to be laid offI moved in with my parents for awhile , but eventually went back
1	My husband worked off and on with another company the rest of 2012 and 2013 , finally getting laid off permanently this year
1	He had a job for three months and got laid off again , and is now refusing to even look for workWhen I question him or tell him how disappointed I am , he always throws the fact he 's trying in my face
1	He does n't help me around the house , refuses to talk about his plans , and berates me for apparently being selfish when I ask him to find workMy husband is so stuck in the past that there is no future in sight
1	I do n't know if I owe it to him to stay , our if I cut my losses and go
1	I 'm not attracted to him , have no respect for him , and dread going home most nights
1	We have no children , and I 'm afraid if I stay with him I never will
1	He has said multiple times that he is going to do what he wants to do first
1	I just feel so guilty bc we have so many memories togetherCurrently it 's 330pm and he is still asleep
1	That 's his new routine , games all night and sleep all day
1	His solution is to ask his mom for money , to whom we already owe thousands
1	2003 I had a swollen lymph node in my neck , grew , had removed , was benign
1	2010 found a benign mass on my brain , said most likely born w it , no treatment or follow up recommended
1	Lymph nodes in back of neck have been swollen since 2003 I have swollen lymph nodes in my neck and above left collar bone only one there that stay swollen
1	In 2014 I had twins and 5 days after my cesarean I began to run a fever and having difficulty breathing so I went to the ER , the dr was concerned about a pulmonary aneurysm or infection
1	Infection in incision was ruled out and blood work showed a possible clot so they ordered a CT of my chest
1	It came back there was no clot in my lung but they did notice several spots on my lung that they called nodules , and recommended a follow up CT in 6 months
1	Had the follow up CT and I think one changed 1 mm but nothing of concern and was told to follow up annually now
1	They said I could 've always had these or from a prior infection
1	However at that scan they did say they saw several spots on my liver , most likely benign nodules as well , no follow up recommended
1	This has always been in back of my mind and concerned me
1	Saw another Dr because I am having hormonal imbalances and he suggested I see a pulmonologist because he is concerned about lymph node in collar bone , said he has had two patients with no risk factors have a lymph node swollen there and it was lung cancer
1	He tested me for TB , was negative
1	My CBC was also normal
1	This all became worrisome to me again today because I noticed a lymph node in groin swollen
1	So my question is should I push for more tests or are the odds so low that it 's cancer due to blood work and CT not changing
1	I am 33 and have never smoked
1	My great grandmother passed from lung cancer but she was a smoker
1	I am so just so fearful they missed something but at the same time do not want to be exposed to more radiation from tests , as well as it 's financially difficult as well
1	ever since i was young i always had a very vivid imagination
1	when i was about 1415 i began hearing voices or having thoughts i could n't identify as my own , they seemed to possess higher knowledge of which i certainly could n't be capable of comprehending
1	for days i could sit and write out things over without ever repeating yet they all seemed to string together , in a sort of theorylike pattern
1	sometimes they were about me talking in third person , other times they were about scientific philosophies and meanings of life
1	Later on i became a paranoid delusional , i stopped going to school because i thought everyone was saying things behind my back and i even lost a lot of friends because of it
1	i 've had some pts in the past years and i think i suppressed something into my subconscious thought patterns
1	i smoke pot regularly and have been using it to self medicate my depression from what is emotionally scarring me and has been for years
1	however before i discovered pot , voices seem to control a lot of what did when i was younger and depressed
1	ei cutting , the voices still tell me to do it but ever since i started smoking pot regularly i 've been strong enough to stop
1	i know pot is linked to a lot of schizophrenia you find today but i 've always thought i was a born schizophrenic however i 'm worried
1	can your subconscious take over if you are conscious of it
1	I 've been depressed for about 6 years , since right before middle school
1	I was in an extremely negative environment with my dad and stepmom since 4th grade , but I moved in with my mom my freshman year
1	Tbh , I did n't think anything was wrong with me , other than always feeling awful and being scared to go home , but last year I became suicidal
1	I 'm literally thinking of ways to acquire a firearm , and I 'm just drowning in guilt and disappointment
1	I want to die , but I ca nt just leave a bloody corpse for my parents to find , after everything they 've done for me
1	My dad is now on the other side of the US and I doubt he 'd want to fly back over here for his daughter 's funeral
1	So now , its between me doing what I want to do , or doing what s best for my family
1	I 've told my mom in the past that I was depressed and had suicidal thoughts , but she told me it was because of my pill dosage
1	which stopped awhile ago , so I know that it was nt because of that I ca nt tell my friends , if I can even call them that
1	They would n't even notice me missing , so that makes it easier I suppose
1	I 'm just so stressed out here , I 'm losing more sleep than I usually do
1	I do nt want to live , but I do nt want to do this to my family either
1	And should I confess to my parents or keep it to myself
1	Anyone out there ever experienced extreme emotional abuse to the point where , you actually question , do I deserve this or am I causing these people to hurt me in my life ,   to make things a bit clearer I was with a very emotionally abusive man for many years 16yrs   and he checked out but not really , says terrible things to me , he says he has moved on that he hates me the thing is i did nothing to deserve the extreme hate he is my legal husband but I do n't think of him as a husband because he never wassupportive or financially supportive in any way So do I cause this kind of chaos in my life because , something to me is better then nothing
1	I am a trauma survivor , I was sexually abused by my grandfather when I was 4 years old , my dad was an abusive man , well he never cared about me on any level , really , and my mom left when I was a kid , but did return to my life as i got older , I am now happy to have her and she is a testament that people can change
1	I have always been in abusive relationships but this was I thought was my last I did everything to make him happy I thought now I am trying to learn to live alone at 49 and I am having a hard time , I do n't want to let someone treat me so badly , we have 1 life and I think I deserve to live in healthy from now on , but how do I do that
1	I suspect my male partner has BPD but is undiagnosed
1	I have mentioned it to him a few times over the last couple of years when I started researching how he acts , but this week I had a productive talk with him and opened up about his feelings for the first time
1	I would like to know what to do next in order to help him
1	I met him 8 years ago , when he was in a fiery relationship with another girl
1	When they split up and we got together , he put me on a pedestal , wanted to move in , propose straight away etc
1	Then after a few months , I suspected infidelity a few times with his ex
1	However he had a story for everything and even though evidence was staring me in the face , still convined myself it was not happening
1	We started looking after his children at weekends etc
1	and he often asks them to confirm how much they love him etc
1	He often asks me this too
1	He soon soon started being very up and down   either I was on the pedestal , or being treated like sit all the time   ie
1	I became aware that he was abusing alcohol , and he has physically assaulted me several times , mainy over little things
1	He also took my cars off me several times when he was drunk and had crashes etc
1	After a few years of talking to him , he agreed to go on an alochol detox program and has since reduced his alcohol intake significantly , but then substituted this for heroin use
1	He will sell anything to get his next dose , lie about it , borrows money off everyone and compulsively lies
1	Sometimes he admits about taking it , and tells me he feels guilty and wants to stop , but is very easily lead by others
1	He eventually cut all ties with his ex , but then began a relationship with another girl
1	Again , evidence was staring me in the face , but I stayed with him
1	I put it down to the fact that he was stressed with me sometimes because I was on edge a lot about is drinking and drug taking , so thought that as this girl was an alcoholic as well , he felt relaxed sometimes around her because she did n't know about his underlying problems and was always on hand to lend him money etc
1	Again he denied having done anything with her
1	He often idealises and then deidealises certain people   one minute they are his best friend , the next he is fighting physically with them etc
1	He recently got arrested for stabbing someone and is in court on Monday
1	I was talking to him the other night , and he said that he has always felt empty and does n't know what having real friends are   said all his friends all his life have been either taking advantage of him or he takes advantage o them
1	He says he feels he relates to these people more than the people I introduce him to , as he feels on edge around people in social situations as he fears not having anything to say and being ignored etc
1	He then told me he had never had any motivation do achieve anything in his life since he was little , felt empty inside and feels detatched from people , even though he appears to be over the top with certain friends , ie seems to want certain people around all the time , even if it means we have no time alone together becasue he constantly invites them round etc
1	Also said he does't know who he is inside and is scared of being alone
1	He jumps straight into a relationship even if it is inappropriate , each time he has come out of a previous relationship
1	A couple of times I told him I was leaving him , due to the infidelity evidence
1	He gets aggressive when this happens , then rings me the next day begging forgiveness but still denies doing anything with the girls
1	He was told during childhood , that the person he thought was his father was n't , and only recently met his biological father
1	He said he knows he lies a lot but ca nt help himself
1	Sometimes I think he believes the lies he tells
1	He has also self harmed , and told me it is a release of pain that otherwise he would have to be violent in order to release
1	He told me also that if I ever left him , he would hook up with this girl I suspect he has been having the affair with , purely to avoid being alone
1	He asked me after this discussion , if I would discuss what he told me with his GP
1	However , he is likely to be going to prison on Monday , so I do not know how to go about getting him assessed
1	He said he thought that the symptoms I discussed with him sounded like how he feels
1	He has been on antidepressents for about a year   but I understand that these conditions ca n't be diagnosed or tested for properly until no drugs or alcohol are in the person 's system
1	If he is in prison , this will obviously be the case , but I wo n't be there to go to the appts with him etc
1	When he gets angry at everyone else , including his family , they get angry back and end up making him worse
1	I never get angry , but just try to talk to him about what he has said or done at a stage when he is calmer etc
1	Is there anyone out there who could advise me as to what action to take next , and whether or not his symptoms and behaviour sound like those of BPD
1	My husband and I are in the middle of a divorce
1	He says he loves me and wants to be with me , but he 's not willing to stop the divorce so we can take time to work on our marriage , he wants to go to counseling while the divorce is in place , and he says if he sees progress in marriage counseling , he might consider stopping the divorce
1	I have been so angry because I feel like he 's holding it over my head
1	He completely avoids me , we do n't talk to each other and the only time we see each other is when we are picking up or dropping off the kids at each other 's house , but one of the issues he wants me to work on in this marriage is trust
1	I feel like he 's seeing someone else , and when I ask him , he says no , and tells me that I never trusted him our entire relationship , why would I trust what he 's saying now
1	He tells me , I love you and want to be with you and I 'm not cheating on you , but his actions tell me something differently
1	He told me the other day to get all the issues with the divorce situated now , so we can take the next 4 months and work on our realationship
1	Our divorce will be finalized in 4 months , that 's why he says 4 months
1	No matter what he says to me , I feel in my heart that he has no intention of stopping the divorce
1	I have been so hurt , angry and depressed these last couple months , that earlier this week , I told him that I ca n't do it anymore , I ca n't try to save our 13 year relationship in 4 months , and not to mention that our divorce has been very ugly , we 've been fighting about everything
1	It hurts , but I feel like I have to walk away and give him the divorce , and stop holding on , because I feel like he 's let go , and I need to do the same
1	Hello , first off let me say I 'm a successful woman in my early 40 's with a wonderful husband and kids
1	My mother has always resented me
1	She told me I was once the reason she had to stay married to a verbally abusive alcoholic
1	I 'm not going to get into all the details but lets just say she has never ever been there for me nor has she ever been happy for any good things in my life
1	My siblings treat me the same
1	I have problems being in friendships because I always feel they will abandon me or toss me away like my own family has
1	I have anger that is always just below the surface because I 'm so sad that no one feels I 'm worthy of being in their life
1	My husband and I do many charitable things and I work with rescue horses
1	I feel for some part that my family is jealous of my life even though i have always shared in my success
1	taking my sister and niece on trips and spending many vacations with them
1	But when ever on of them are unhappy in their life they toss me aside and I do n't hear from them for years on end
1	I have n't spoken to my mom in over 3 years
1	The last conversation my husband had with my mom was over a argument on why she chosedidn't have to to put my horse down on my Birthday he was 31 and she chose to do it on my birthday to stab me in the heart
1	My mother told my husband that she was so sick of you People meaning me and my husband
1	Those words hurt more than losing my horse I had for over 29 years
1	If I did n't have my husband and two sons I probably would disappear
1	I sometimes get so angry I could lash out at anyone
1	So I am almost sixteen years old and I have been been going through a few things
1	I do n't think it 's cancer because it 's been going on for a few years on and off
1	A few years ago , I went on a really strict diet and really quickly into it I started getting really dizzy and I would n't be able to see for a few seconds
1	The longer I was on the diet , the more often it happened and the longer my lack of being able to see came along
1	My mom took me off the diet when I lost my balance one time and since then it 's happened on and off
1	Along with this , I 've had a chronic headache for years
1	Usually I have to take Ibuprofen within an hour after any sort of pain going on in my head before it gets so bad I fall to me knees and I do n't want to walk
1	This all might be nothing but the dizziness if really worrying me because it came back a few times today and I was just wondering what you guys might be able to tell me
1	Thank you for reading this , and I hope you can get back to me as soon as possible
1	Now i 'm waking up to the fact that i think my husband is demented enoungh to try and make me sell this property nd split it
1	I 've got to admit that i have n't been taking it well and i 've said and done things that i 'm not proud of , i think at that boiling point you are relieved of the burden and can move forward to the resolution and acceptance of what 's happening
1	Today i spent most of the day fine tuning the documents on ' The List '
1	i borrowed a digital camera from my brother and going to take pictures and inventory his tools and the shop stuff
1	He liked his tools
1	It 's a way for him to make a living , he has skills , he 's only 54 , he can find a job in Los Vegas and settle into his life there
1	Experience the things he 's missed since he married me when he was only 23 , just out of the Marine Corps
1	i just hope he does it soon because i hate it hanging over my head Question What do i do now to protect myself
1	At the end of 2014 my mom made a couple friends
1	Shed always talk about them to me and I was always very proud of her for finally having new friends because ever since my family moved states back in 2009 she had n't left the house
1	So in 2014 she came to me for advice about if I think it 's okay for her to meet her new friends in person
1	ofcourse I encouraged her
1	Well she finally did that weekend and she told me all of these fun stories about her and her friend Stacey , michelle and this gay guy names Stan
1	I was happy for her and so was my dad
1	All through 2015 my mom would go and visit her best friends every single weekend
1	She even went out of state with them and told me crazy stories
1	No matter how crazy they sounded I believed her 100 because that 's how much I trust her
1	My dad asked me a few times if she was cheating on him and i thought he was insane for even thinking that
1	Soon enough my mom told me that she found a guy that she liked and that she does n't want to be with my dad anymore
1	She said that as it turns , the gay guy in her group of friends is n't gay and that he might have a little crush on her too
1	I was kinda shocked but I then tried to tell her that she should n't drag my dad along if you do n't love him anymore then you should tell him
1	She said that I was right
1	My dad spent new years alone and I tried making him feel better by playing bingo , chess , and other board games with him
1	I wondered why my mom would rather spend new years with her friends and not us
1	She did the same on her birthday
1	In the 3RD week of January my mom and dad said they were getting a divorce
1	I tried to act surprised but I just knew it was coming
1	On my 18th birthday i was nt able to spend the day with my dad because my mom wanted me to spend the day with her and her crush
1	This is the day i found out everything my mom and stan were going on one year of dating and her other friends did nt exist
1	I believed every single irrational word that came out of her mouth about her fake friends
1	I felt like crying but i just could nt
1	She then sent me and my sister home so she can finish her weekend with you boyfriend
1	I could nt look at my dad when i got home
1	I just went up to my room and sat there thinking about everything
1	A couple months later my mom made my dad move to the state we used to live in
1	And Then a couple months after that she told me that her and stan are being forced to move to florida
1	That he got fired and he got a job offer in florida she said she does nt want to move there but she had no choice
1	Plus his twin brother lived there so it worked out perfectly had my dad move to the state we used to live in she and her boyfriend moved to Florida and are living happily
1	to this day my dad does n't know about my moms bf and i m just trying to stay afloat since I 'm still in college
1	My mom does n't call me much anymore and I recently found out that my mom and her boyfriend were planning this out months before he even got fired
1	My mom and i are no where near as close as we used to be
1	She 's changed a lot or maybe it 's me
1	I do nt know why I do that
1	For example I had this professor and she was so sweet and kind to me and I always tried to impress her or look for her approval
1	I do nt know why I feel like that
1	I ca n't go to therapy I ca n't afford it either
1	All these questions keep popping up in my head and I hate it that I do n't know any of the answers
1	So I ignored it did n't know it was possible , but I ignored myself
1	But I ca n't anymore , I ca n't ignore it anymore
1	I used to sport , to skip meals , to bingeeat and make myself throw up and to harm myself to just forget what was going on in my life , to just numb my feelings , to forget the chaos
1	I lost my interest in the sports I used to love , I never have enough energy anyway
1	I 'm trying to leave the eating disorder stuff behind have been trying for 2,5 years and friends convinced me to stop with self harm 8 months ago , which I did
1	Right now I 'm in the middle of my school exams , more stress
1	Next week I 've got a huge paper due , and I 'm not even slightly close to finishing it
1	A pile that 's starting to sufficate me , to drown me
1	I kinda hit rock bottom yesterday , at least it feels like I did
1	And I did n't stop where I used to stop
1	I could forget for one moment , I could stop thinking for a few seconds
1	Just listening to the loud music from my headphone and cuttingWhen I stopped , I cleaned up and had to use a bandage to stop the bleeding
1	I sat on my bed and it hit me
1	The reality , the life I was living , the life I was n't living
1	I broke , I shattered in thousands of pieces and I could n't stp crying
1	But hey , I was sitting there , on my bed , at 2h30 in the morning , everyone asleep , except from me
1	This morning I wanted to tell my dad , I wanted him to hug me , like only fathers can do
1	I kept my mouth shut and went to school , some moments crying while riding my bike
1	I have no idea how , but my Dutch Literature exam about poetry went quite well
1	Afterwards I reported sick and went home tomorrow is a new day with a new mountain of fears to conquer an exams to make
1	I read a few pages in my old diary , from the time I was suffering from anorexia , and the last line was Will it ever get better
1	That was about 3 years ago , I 'm not anorexic of bulimic anymore , but I 'm suffering from a depression and selfharm
1	I am 15 years old and have always had anxiety which recently got worse
1	I am just starting to see the heavier effects of puberty growth spurt , voice change , etc and just started to get extremly depressed to where i do nt want to talk to friends , go to school , play my favorite sport , lost motivation , constantly wanting to sleep , always thinking about past mistakes , worrying about every little thing , and getting sad at random times
1	I started using marijuana a year ago but have been using it alot more in the past few months to help cope with the constant stress and anxiety but i think it may have been too much since its all i want to do anymorei would use it every day over the summer and every weekendsome week days during school
1	I am going to see a therapist soon to see if i can get medication to hopefully help offset the marijuana addiction
1	Out of those six I can only truly remember three of them vividly , because those were the ones that affected me most
1	All my middle school years I was taught in the Christian private school system
1	My sixth grade year was my first year at a small classical school
1	I was happy for change and I did accept it with open arms , but one thing scared me
1	I ca n't help but fear that someone wo n't like me for me , or that someone will not want to hang around me because I do n't fit their idea of someone worth being a friend with
1	When I arrived at school I was taken by how small it was , and how I only had a handful of kids in my grade
1	That year flashed by before I knew it
1	I had my crushes and the boys that I would flirt with here and there , but there was this one boy that I could n't keep out of my mind
1	He had my heart and I could not manage to get it back from him
1	No matter who I managed to crush on or think was cute at the time , I wanted this boy to be mine more than any of them
1	The saddest part was I never truly knew if wanted for me to be his
1	He was always talking about girls outside of our school but he never talked about me the way he did others
1	I can remember January of that year and how I had finally managed to make him like me somehow
1	We would pass notes in class and we even had our secret note passing technique
1	I was just so enamored with the small things that I was never concerned with PDA or anything more than just sitting besides him in class
1	Then it all ended , and came crashing down on top of me , but I never gave up on my hope for the relationship to flourish again
1	My eighth grade year was a very rough year
1	For some reason I have always had a problem with one particular girl in my classes at school
1	Well whatever it was should not have caused me to treat her the way that I did
1	I was wrong to do the things that I did to her , and I was wrong to tell this girl some of the things I did
1	I regret doing those things because there is a part of me that wonders if maybe things could have been different between us
1	After the DC trip I started to flirt with a red haired boy in my class , he was sweet and at the time he was the person that I was interested in
1	Soon after me and him had established our thing as boyfriend and girlfriend I began thinking about the boy I liked in seventh grade
1	No matter how many times I let my red haired crush hold my hand or give me a hug it still never compared to the feeling I got from passing notes with the boy I liked even more
1	Eventually the thing that me and the red haired boy had began to fade away , so we called it quits and moved on to other people
1	At the end of that year my school held a senior night crawfish boil , and that 's when I saw him
1	The boy that I had n't seen in a whole year
1	The boy that I still got butterflies in my stomach when I heard his name
1	He was there and so was his friend
1	Sadly though he came to see a girl that he really liked at the time , and so I was put to the side
1	I had waited all that time in hopes of seeing him , and talking to him again
1	I was n't going to let him slip through my fingers this time
1	I got onto my email account and I sent him an email hoping that he still used the same email address from years back , and in hopes that he would still check it often
1	To my shock he did
1	We emailed back and forth for weeks and months
1	Eventually my parents got me a phone so we exchanged numbers and began texting
1	I talked to him more through texts then I think I had in seventh grade
1	We told each other everything and we gave advice to one another all the time
1	I would help him with his girl issues , while he assisted me with my guy issues
1	During those months I was happier than ever
1	Summer soon ended and ninth grade year came faster than I had expected
1	I did n't mind though because as long as I had that boy to talk to and talk about things with there was nothing that I was n't ready to take on
1	Except for when a brown haired cutie decided that he could just put his hand where ever he so choose
1	That was when I realized that I need someone that would defend me in that sort of situation
1	He texted the brown haired cutie and a few text messages later he was no longer an issue of mine anymore
1	The rest of ninth grade went by faster than any other year and before I knew it I found that trouble was around the corner for me
1	I was so gullible back then and all I needed was a compliment or two then I was under your spell
1	Then once he got what he wanted from me he threw me to the side , and had his friends do it as well
1	My seventh grade boy crush did n't take the news of what happened well and he decided that me and him probably should n't talk anymore
1	So my ninth grade summer and beginning of sophomore year , the time I needed someone to talk to more than any other time he was n't there for me
1	During the time that I was facing the consequences of my actions he began dating the girl that I had treated terribly
1	At first I was angry because he had totally left me alone
1	I still love him , but I know that he is in a relationship and that 's something that is extremely hard for me to deal with
1	Allow me to start by saying this has been going on since November
1	A few days after allowing my boyfriend to finger me with saliva as lubricant , I had begun feeling irritated on my vagina
1	I told my mom about the irritation , but not the fingering , and she had me wait to see if it would get better , however it did not
1	She then took me to a PA who informed me not to worry about STDS since I 've never had actual sex before
1	She prescribed me a yeast medication which made symptoms worse
1	She then prescribed me a bacterial infection medicine which did n't help
1	I explained again about what had happened , but I forgot to tell both of the doctors that I had felt the irritation right after
1	I just told the gyno my sexual history and she once again said that since I was n't havin sex , gono and chlyamdia were not a concern
1	She prescribed me something else for just contact , which caused more burning so I stopped it , and am just using the Dove soap she told me to switch to
1	Now I 'm scared that maybe if my boyfriend was sick and he fingered me with saliva , could that have given me something like his illness except in my vagina
1	Was neglecting to tell her that I felt the irritation two days after a bad thing
1	My boyfriend has never been sexually active with anybody but me and the same goes for myself and him
1	I have been so terrified lately to the point where I will be seeing a therapist fairly soon
1	I 'm scared constantly and I can not even tell if my fears are rational
1	Sometimes I get scared that his dad maybe cheated on his mo without her knowing and gave her an std which she passed on to her son , my boyfriend
1	I am scared day in and day out and I ca n't even tell my mom because I do n't want to hurt her and I have had to tell her about something like this before when I was scared I was pregnant because I was scared his precum got in my vagina when he fingered me , and it was a horrible time
1	They did CT wo contrast and it said no stones but it said left lung base demonstrates an area of nodularity noted with multiple tiny satellite nodules with some reticulonodular densities
1	My symptoms are general malaise , nausea , overall body pain , daily migraines , frequent diarrhea , some chest pains , flank pain and right lower quadrant pain
1	I do n't have fevers but am never comfortable temperature for last 6 months , always too cold or too hot and my symptoms keep getting worse rather than leveling off or getting better
1	Docs are n't worried but they 're not having to live in the daily pain
1	My husband and I dated for 6 years did not live together and have been married for almost 15 years
1	While we were dating , we pretty much never fought and he treated me just great   he never looked at other women or asked me to change anything about myself , nor did he judge or criticize me
1	This was the kind of man I had hoped to meet some day
1	While we dated , he was attracted to the fact that I was a strongwilled , assertive , selfsufficient person who was selfconfident and knew how to get things done
1	Even though we dated for 6 years , I really was n't on any particular timetable as to getting married , but we talked about our future and we assumed we 'd get married some day
1	When he bought me a ring and proposed , it was a huge surprise to me , but I knew it was right and said yes
1	About 6 months after we married , he became the complete opposite person he 'd been while we were dating
1	He started looking at other women right in front of me , he judged and criticized my opinions and appearance subtly at first , then more outright and negatively
1	He started looking at porn which I never knew him to do previously although he 's admitted that he 's looked at it since early teens and his use of it has become increasingly more frequent
1	He quickly got to the point where he voiced to me his strong opinions on what I should wear and how much time I should not spend wmy family   to whom he knew I had always been closeHe has treated me this way even though I 've done alot of the things that he 's said I should do as to my appearance , and I ’ve tried to change what I 'm interested in and the way I spend my time in order to be more like he wants
1	I 'm angry with him for doing this to me , but I am capable of forgiving him , and I do each time , but then he eventually repeats his negativity , criticism and anger toward me
1	10 months ago , we had a baby after he 'd decided that parenthood was something we should do since we are getting old
1	I 'd always wanted to be a mom , so that was OK wme even though I 'd made it known to him that I hoped to adopt
1	I was n't sure how that would change him in the way he treated me but I hoped for the best
1	I was wrong   when I was 8 months pregnant , he started having a midlife crisis and wanted to be 25 again   spending late nights out wthe 20somethings he worked with
1	He got text messages that were questionably racy although I know he has n't cheated on me and I found out he has still been looking at porn
1	Three days after I had my baby , he called me a hermit and said I should be up and around and bringing in company
1	A few weeks later , he criticized my weight and told me I let myself go during my pregnancy I only gained 45 pounds and I 'm now only about 4 pounds away from my prepregnancy weight
1	I recently was asked why I let myself get pregnant , given my unhappy marital state
1	I had to think long and hard about why I permitted myself to get pregnant after 13 years of a very painful marriage
1	I did n't want to say “ no ” because it would have caused a fight and it would be one more thing for him to criticize me about and bring up as a reason why I 'm not a good wife
1	I realize now that this is a lousy reason , given that I risked bringing an innocent child into an otherwise unhappy home   and sure enough , exactly that thing happened
1	I should be very clear though   I do not regret the decision to try to get pregnant , because I am crazy in love with our son
1	During our marriage , he 's shared wme that he had a bad temper as a teen and that he 's angry about what he says was a toohigh level of control that his parents maintained over him during his childhood
1	He 's not a jealous person as to me
1	Nevertheless , every time I call him OUT when he becomes , critical , judgmental or angry with me , he blames me almost entirely for his anger , for his use of porn , for his unhappiness in life personally and professionally and for a long list of other things
1	He says he wishes he 'd waited to get married and tells me that things would be OK if I 'd be less independent minded
1	He also tells me he thinks we can work things out if we get counseling one more time even though wthe past 3 counselors , nothing ever changed
1	As for counseling , a couple months after our son was born , he agreed to attend a group recovery course at our church for individuals struggling with sexual issues
1	He attended that course for 5 months and seemed to be doing so much better
1	During that time , we also started attending marriage counseling and we recently became involved in a group marriage course
1	These things seemed to change the level of hope that we both had for our marriage and we both expressed to each other that we believed these were the tools we ’ve needed all along – his criticism and anger seemed to be gone and for once , we BOTH were genuinely trying to make each other happy
1	Now , here we are , 7 months into all our group and marriage counseling endeavors and we just took a trip out of town to relax together
1	Within hours of us arriving at our destination , I felt like I was timewarped back into the “ darkdays ” because he spent the first several hours looking at other women , then when I was walking with him and got my heel caught in a sidewalk crack , he barked at me that I should try to be more “ smooth ” and assertive
1	I took those things pretty well and did n’t say much about it because I thought he was just stressed out from the change in environment and I thought he ’d relax soon enough so we could enjoy the rest of the trip
1	Later that night , when things seemed to be going better , he yelled at me because I was n’t getting out of the cab quick enough and even the cabbie looked at him like he could n’t believe what he was hearing
1	I let that just roll off my back and proceeded wthe night
1	Then he melted down again about the littlest thing did n’t involve me this time and when I asked him to try to relax , he insulted me
1	The next morning he pulled something sexual in nature that I find intolerable in a marriage relationship and I called him on it and he burst into a blame session , explaining that I am not meeting his needs , what he did was my fault , I wrecked our marriage from the start , etc
1	I had a hard time with this , but eventually agreed that we could continue our trip and we went out for the day to start to try enjoying ourselves
1	Instead of making an effort to try to revive the trip and focus on us as a couple , he spent the next 3 hours looking at every young woman in a skirt
1	I ’d had enough – I explained to him that such behavior is so hurtful to me due to our past problems and he blamed me for not wearing my skirts short enough and for wearing closedtoe heels instead of opentoe heels
1	On the streets of Manhattan , heels are tough , but I ’d worn opentoe heels the entire day before   that just was n’t good enough for him
1	My question is this Is this my fault and if so , what should I do differently
1	I know I 'm not perfect   I gained , then lost about 20 pounds since we 've been married before the pregnancy and I 've made some mistakes in the way I spent money on our household furnishings , but that was 1412 years ago and he 's never forgiven me and brings it up all the time as the reason he presently does what he does to me
1	I should mention that I believe that God hates divorce and wants me to stay married because my husband is also a Christian and he has n't cheated on me or physically hurt me Also , my love for my husband is strong in the sense that I very much remember what he was like during the six years we were dating and I want that back so much
1	Also , our son deserves a twoparent family , but he also deserves to live in a family where his mother is treated with respect
1	My ex husband and I divorced back in 2005
1	At the start of our seperation we were always fighting
1	Till one day I decided I was no longer going to lend myself to that behavior
1	If I wanted to be happy I had to get away from that
1	Anyhow , since our divorce became final he refuses to talk to me when it pertains to our kids
1	If he has anything to say he 'll send the kids to tell me
1	My kids do n't always understand what he needswants
1	I do n't understand why its so hard for him to communicate with me or why he refuses to talk to me
1	Few times he 's spoken to me he has attitude or a loud nasty tone
1	Which I honestly do n't give him my time
1	Recently he 'll be taking them on a trip out of the country
1	On their passports as emergency contact he put his brother
1	Why does he act like he hates meif it should be the other way around
1	I 'm not asking to be best friends just to be able to be civil when it pertains to our kidsis that to much to ask for
1	About two years ago , I noticed an enlargedswollen node just under my right ear
1	Shortly thereafter , I did have to have my top right wisdom tooth pulled due to a chip and coinciding infection
1	I know that lymph nodes can swell because of tooth issues so I assumed that this would go away after having had the tooth pulled
1	What started out to be a lump the size of my pinky fingertip or so has now grown to the size of my thumb over the years
1	To settle my mind , I 'm hoping that you can help
1	Aside from the lump only noticeable to me , I am in great health
1	While I have not been ill any time in the recent past , I did have one bout with mono back in grade school
1	As a young mother , my mind is solely on my children and I certainly hope that this issue is not serious though I 'm fearing the worst
1	Unfortunately , I do not have insurance coverage at this time so my only hope is an internet diagnosis such as this
1	If there is any advice that you could give me , I would greatly appreciate it
1	I am 22 years old and My memory is really bad I ca nt retain information , I am forgetting the names of objects , I get confused
1	I am deprived of thoughts or poverty of thought meaning I have no thoughts in my head I am a blank page when someone asks me something nothing comes to my head I have a hard time thinking my mind is empty and numb I ca nt explain the world around me becaus eI get confused and forget the names of objects
1	I do nt have insurance so I am unable to see a doc right now I had a ct scan , mri and an eeg 5 months ago and they all came back normal I also saw a psychiatrist and was put on meds but ca nt afford to see him the meds worked for confusion but not for my memoy
1	I just started a new job through a temp agency and I font think I will be able to hold it because of my problems with my mind
1	I was unemployed for a year on two seperate occasions and did nothing but watch tv and i have never been the same
1	I know I am really young but it is getting worse I feel like I deteriorate more every day
1	My doctor prescribed trazodone 100 mg I think it said mg for my insomnia that I have suffered with for the last 15 years due to a thyroid problem I had years ago
1	I took it for the first time last night , but I did not fall asleep or even come close to falling asleep
1	I took it at 830pm and went to bed at 9 pm , but ended up getting out of bed at 10 pm because I could not sleep
1	The only difference I feel is a huge headache this morning
1	I have been on Ambien for the last 2 years , but I can only take it once every seven days 20 mg or it will not work
1	I average about 23 hrs of sleep without sleep medication , I can literally go 36hrs straight with out any sleep , and then I crash and can actually sleep 45 hrs , but I am used to it and do not have a problem with work or any other activities
1	I do not fall asleep at my desk
1	I am unable to napI know my body is fatigued , but my mind will not shut down AT ALL , so NO SLEEP

1	For 5 years i ve been constantly feeling my body for lumps and seem to be always finding new ones
1	As of now , I can feel 7 in my groin , 2 in each armpit , 2 on the back of my neck aligning my spine , 2 of either side of my jaw sort of where your ear connects to your face adjacent to your ear lobe and 2 on the back of my skull behind my ear
1	I used to have pain in my groin when I walked but that only lasted a few months years ago so I 'm extremely scared of cancer , i m a 16 year old male
1	I also always seem to be finding new problems with my body and feel all sorts of aches and pains which make me worry
1	I 'm always tired too although I do nt have the best sleep schedule
1	Around the time I discovered all these lumps I found this lumpy mass in my scrotum which I can only feel when I stand up which I believe to be a varicocele
1	So I 'm extremely scared that all these symptoms are linked and I constantly find myself searching through the internet and fearing the worst , cancer
1	My husband has always been so nice to me
1	I was sent to rehab for 6 months by my family and my husband waited for me
1	we live together for about 3 years but never been married
1	i moved to mexico and that s where i met him
1	i left rehab and went back with him
1	and to the day we still smoke weed
1	but the problem is that after living together for 3 years i finally left him
1	he s beat me up pretty badly
1	if i do nt smoke weed and i m in bad mood and he leaves the house for a 2 or 3 hours i get mad
1	when he comes home i start pushing things around breathing hard , i let him know i m mad
1	i push his button
1	he tells me to click your mouth , or look at me when i m talking to you
1	and sometimes until he slaps my face or my neck
1	i moved out because we have a 2 year old baby now but i miss my husband terribly because i do believe its my fault for annoying him , doing the things he does nt like
1	but does he have the right to hit me
1	or should i stop being that annoying brat i 've always been and maybe he really will change
1	I wish I 'd known about this mental condition during my 1 year relationship , which ended 2 months ago
1	My ex is 52 , handsome , intelligent and he manifests many of the symptoms describing BPD especially , the anger and irritability issues
1	He had described a childhood filled with chaos   conflict physical   emotional neglect physical abuse feelings of being unloved   unwanted abandonment an alcoholic mother a philandering father etc
1	He has a history of cutting people out of his life when relationships go sour or not his way
1	He 's been married   divorced twice with no contact with the ex 's which is , maybe , understandable will not talk to his sister does n't talk to his father has no contact with his 4 children nor with his grandchildren
1	And , is currently living with the mother who he claims to hate and blames for much of his past trauma
1	Since our breakup which he initiated , he has not contacted me
1	However , I 'd like to take the high road and extend an olive branch of friendship as I am concerned for his mental well being and would like to be a support to him
1	Oh , he was a bedwetter in his youth is that consistent with the BPD childhood history
1	I am a 54 year old woman
1	Three years ago my boyfriend called me at work and I was in a meeting
1	When I got out , I returned the call and he did n't answer
1	Then I texted him and he did n't answer
1	I waited an hour and called him again with no answer
1	On my lunch I ran home to see if everything was ok , but at the same time fearing the worst
1	When I arrived at home , much to my horror , I found him dead in our bed   , y worst fear
1	I have gotten over that as much as a person can and moved on to a new relationship with someone that I hope to send the rest of my life with
1	We have been together for a year and a half and it is a long distance relationship for now
1	When I have n't heard from him , or he has n't answered his phone or texted me back , I immediately fear the worst again , because the worst has already happened to me
1	I go into a full fledged panic attack , hyperventilating , breaking out in a cold sweat , sobbing so hard I ca n't breathe , shaking uncontrollably , etc
1	I know that the chances of something bad happening again are probably low , but because of my history I ca n't help it
1	When we first got together , I told him that this was the only baggage that I would bring to the relationship , and he has been great about it and gotten better at staying in touch
1	He is moving here now and going back to see his kids every other weekend , so it does n't happen as much , but now it happens easier than before
1	I am a sixteen year old girl
1	I do n't drink , I do n't do drugs , do n't smoke , I eat well   exercise
1	I get along with people okay but I do n't really have many close friends , maybe two or three
1	When I was thirteen I began cutting myself and most of my fourteenth year was a huge downward spiral I am almost certain that I suffered from some form of depression in that year but have never been diagnosed as my parents just shook it off , saying I was too young
1	I have n't harmed myself since I was fourteen though
1	However , lately past three or four months I 've been feeling really down and I have noticed that I have been feeling much the same way as I did when I was fourteen
1	Lately I 've been crying at random intervals the tiniest things can make me break down
1	I constantly feel at the point of a breakdown , and I feel stressed all the time
1	I usually just feel in a constant downinthedumps kind of mood , but sometimes I start to listen to words in my head not voices or delusions , I am aware that they are my own thoughts in my mind saying things like you are a failure , no one loves you , you deserve to die , you are unbelievably stupid , you are worthless
1	This could pop up at any time , for example in conversation with peers and I say something slightly awkward that everyone else shakes off but then those thoughts come into my head and I ca n't fight them off , as hard as I try
1	Also , I used to write poetryprose almost every day , or at least in my journal , but I have n't written anything for a good six months
1	I just ca n't seem to put my feelings on paper
1	I 'm scared to tell my parents about how I feel because they are both going through a lot at the moment
1	I know that they will see me as a disappointment if I tell them because I remember how they acted when I was fourteen
1	I do n't want to put them through that again , but at the same time I 'm scared that I 'm going to get worse
1	Is there anything I can do on my own to shake it off without letting my parents know
1	How do I get my wife the Mental illness help she needs
1	We have been married 17 years now
1	Our marriage did n't start out too good financial and she lied about her credit card debt and abuse
1	Right when we got married I paid off 12,000 of her credit cards
1	But months later I say credit card bills in the 25,000 range
1	She did n't tell me because she knew I wo n't marry her
1	Now 17 years later I ca n't get a loan , we have 5 children 23 , 19 , 16 , 15 , and 13
1	We have been to counciling financial and marriage for the last 13 years
1	But I ca n't take the chance the kids will be given to her
1	I and the councilers think she is bipolar
1	There has been abuse in the past but with the counciling I have been through I am in control at the moment
1	She has tantrum if she does n't get her way
1	They are endless and leaving does n't help because when I come back it starts up again
1	Social workers will not help me because I 'm a man and they only seem to care about women
1	I ca n't talk to her because if the logic goes against her she changes the subject and starts on something completely different
1	She did this to the last counciler and he gave up
1	When she gets depressed she spends money
1	She was taking medication at one time and it helped but her favorite saying is everyone else has the problem not me
1	I have depression for 4 yearsand I m just 20
1	I started to feel depressed from 4 years backthat time I jointed a school
1	and my frnd deadboth made me so feel sadsince that time I could not concentrate on studies
1	before 4 years I was like multi talended
1	but now even I can not speak wellI miss my friends but they are beside mebut I could not speak with them well
1	I want myself back when I do a important think it will make headache
1	I lost my believeness
1	but I taking tablets for depression nexito forte for 4 monthsI feel some impromentbut my mood changing frequentlystill I have problems
1	before 4 years I m the no 1 student in my class
1	I ca n't do anything wellI want my self back
1	Some time last month , my friend Bradon went to the guidance office in my school because he was feeling down , and he was told he had many signs of depression
1	On that same day , he told me so , and told me the signs that he has
1	Most of the ones he said I had also , but I did n't really think I myself could have depression , because I felt pretty content , or I just wanted to block it out
1	But after that , I started to realize that I may actually have it
1	I 'm a freshman in highschool , with a good amount of friends , I laugh and smile and have a pretty decent time at school
1	I 'm not really stressed , and I do n't particularly feel sad or down all the time
1	I feel extremely exhausted , even if I good amount of sleep
1	I used to go to bed around 11 pm , and wake up at 645am
1	But now , I go to bed at 845pm or 9 pm , I end up waking up around 615 , and throughout the day , my eyes feel extremely sore and heavy
1	When I get home from school , I 'm already so tired that by the time I get into bed I feel like I 'll never wake up
1	My appetite has also gone down , yes my stomach still growls and I know when I 'm hungry , but it 's like I 'd rather sit and do nothing than get up and get a snack or eat dinner
1	In my house , my older brother works , so my mom does n't cook every single night , and since she works till 4 pm cooking all day , I can understand why
1	So a few time a week I just make a bowl of rice for dinner
1	At school I eat normally , but I end up throwing away a good amount
1	Before , I would go home and eat a snack and then eat dinner a few hours later , but now it 's like if I 'm not uncomfortable from being hungry , I wo n't eat
1	I usually tend to draw every single day , but whenever I start something , I feel like it 's not worth the time and I can finish it another time
1	That 's how most of my things go , I do n't finish it unless I need too immediately
1	My music before would always give me some sort of inspiration , but now I do n't feel anything from it
1	I 've been snapping a lot at my mom for the stupidest reasons , but I end up forgetting why I was made while still being mad at her
1	I can honestly say I do n't feel much except for anger
1	I can have good days and laugh and smile , but that does n't necessarily mean I 'm happy , just that something can make me perk up a bit
1	I 'm not suicidal nor do I have any intent on doing ANYTHING of that sort , I enjoy living my life , my currently in just worried for my emotional state
1	I ca n't exactly talk to my mom about this , because in terrified
1	I feel like she 'll just tell me I do n't and brush it off , or just send me off for therapy which I have had before for trauma but I hated it
1	I ca n't talk to my school guidance counselor because I m scared to go alone , and my friend Brandon does n't seem to want to come down with us
1	If someone could let me know what 's going on that would be great , I just want to make sure that it 's depression or something serious before I talk to my mom about finding a solution
1	Some of you folks will know me by the name Freebird
1	Well this story is n't about meIt is my grandson Kendal
1	From the time he was born Kendal has suffered many symptoms that overlapHis first diag
1	So from 410 asburgers , with obvious tics He was on Tennex2 mg
1	In 08 A cyst was found in his Temporal lobe
1	So at Duke Medicial in NC her underwent Brain Surgery
1	He had a year woth of scans and home monitoring devices to detect seizuresbefore the operation OK fast forward Kendal is still ticking , having major social skill problemsbasicially friendlessFast forward again
1	Kendal is 13 Off the Tennex and topomax tics have but all gone awayand addressing his low level aggitation and violent outburst most always at home 8 months ago he was put on Abilify 10 mg since then he has gotten worsehis behavior is out of controll
1	Not only is he homicidal   inflicting serious harm to silbingsthrowing mother to the floor he has also put a knife to his throat and threatened to cut his throat during his remorseful timesand new to the mix is inappropriate sexual behaviorKendal has exposed his private parts at the bus stop and at schoolhe was suspended last yearPresent
1	This new sexual impulses is so far out of character for Kendal that now I am thinking it is the Abilify side effectMy daughter is done with the nuerologist and done with Asburgersand is considering a evaulation at Holly Hill Hospitalperhaps in house
1	Even though it runs in the familyThose who know meyou do realize this is the tip of the iceburge My daughter says that right before Kendal goes into a rage His Whole Afflect Changes
1	including his facial features and the tone of his voice afterwards he shows great remorse and cries and says he does n't understand why he does itincluding exposing himselfHe is spending the summer with his dad in West Va and talks to my daughter on a regular basisAll of this was just dropped in my lap less than a week ago
1	I am a very stong woman and I am a problem solver
1	I see this as a cry for help and I will move heaven and earth before I loose my grandson to mental illness when there is so much help out thereI am bi polar with psychotic eposodies
1	I am stable on Kolopin and SeroquelStableKendal has told his mom that he is feeling better and please do n't give up on himSo I have put it out here for you to look at and ponder what your experience has been that would be helpful in understand Kendal and supporting him while he gets the help he needsEspecially if any of you guys have had the same compulsive sexual behaviorWe are adults here so I can handle all mature conversation aroung this issue
1	However within the last 68 months he has gotten to the point that we 're worried for him
1	We just assumed it was normal little boy behavior , until he started showing more and more anger
1	Here are some examples If he does n't get his way or if his feelings get hurt he snaps instantly
1	Earlier he asked for a drink , I told him , Ok , give me just one minute to finish changing your sister and I will
1	And bamn he snapped because I was n't instantly getting it
1	Never hits me nor his little sister and brother , however he occasionally will his big brother
1	He 'll say that he hates me or that he hates himself
1	Full force tantrum , stomping , throwing anything in front of him , screaming to the point I worry the neighbors will be concerned occasionally spit , and the final straw that is making me seek help for him
1	He has started to tell us he s going to kill himself or walk in front of a bus
1	We do n't have cable and have never spoke like that in front of him , how in the world would he even grasp something like that
1	When he is n't this angry he s such a sweet loving boy
1	I seem to be able to calm him easier than others and his love for his baby sister and brother is over flowing
1	His anger is never towards them in fact he s like a baby whisperer
1	  but I desperately want to help my son with his anger and now his school is requesting it as well
1	i just feel like i ca nt control myself
1	i know i love my boyfriend but i feel so out of reach when it comes to emotion , all i do is cry instead of stand up for myself and look for people to feel bad and give me attention
1	instead of having confidence and making people come to me i throw myself at them and i m judged way too quickly
1	i want to change all that because deep down i know i can be a perfect girlfriend and not some dirty tramp who throws herself around for attention because she lacks self confidence
1	my self pity takes over and instead of remembering i have someone who loves me i become selfish and i m hurting the people around me
1	my boyfriend thinks i can just learn to control this and get over it , but i feel like there s something so much bigger and deeper than either one of us can do alone , i need to talk to people who know that deep feeling , the feeling that ont go away no matter how much you want it to because i believe in the long run , it will open his eyes to the fact that i m not doing this to hurt him and that there is something so much bigger
1	I need to change and i think i found a way to start
1	Before I begin , I want you to know that I am not one of these teens who has had some kind of traumatic thing happen in their life , or has been abused or any of that
1	So if you do n't care anymore about me , that 's fine Do n't read on , but I would like some comments though
1	Anyway , I struggle with anxiety and school , and have for about the passed almost two years
1	I am a perfectionist and sometimes stay up til about 3 am doing homework My anxiety was so bad because of this and also the fact that my grandad had Alzheimer 's disease , and it was like torture seeing him suffer so much but after he passed away my anxiety went down a little which was a relief because I was on the edge
1	Last year I became depressed because I was so anxious at school and at home , and I wanted to kill myself , but never had the courage to
1	I self harmed cut once and never did again , but now often use the rubber band , or punch myself on the arm they do n't leave permanent marks
1	I also have this thing for the teachers at this my school , mostly the ones who have tried to help me with my problem
1	I love talking to them , but miss them so much when I go home
1	I have a feeling that may be part of my anxiety
1	I always seek attention from them because I feel if I do n't , I wo nt be happy
1	I just want to make them proud , or want them to be my family
1	I have lately been very selfconscious about the way I look at the moment , and it has crossed my mind to starve myself , i love food , but at the same time , i ca n't even walk without feeling that everyones eyes are glued to the way i walk or the size of my body
1	I just want to be smaller , i am not that big , but i want to be skinny
1	WHen i am at school i scan peoples wrist for scars , and when i find some , it switched something inside me which makes me think i am jealous and upset
1	Its as if i want to feel all the pain that they are feeling , or i want those scars to be on my wrists Maybe i want to take away their pain and give it all to me , or i want to feel like the only one with problems , that 's all i could come up with
1	I know its selfish , but i ca n't stop thinking about this
1	But i keep wishing that something terrible will happen to me maybe to give me a right to feeling the way i do , like maybe getting raped , or abused , or something traumatic
1	BUt i do n't want anyone to notice , especially my family
1	I just want to be invisible , or do drugs and alcohol do n't tell me its bad , i know , we are studying in class , but i still wish i could do it
1	I want to stay back a year in school , or just not turn up at school , or drop out
1	I ca n't work so hard anymore , i just want to sleep and not wakeup
1	My mid is telling me i am not okay after this long , i am starting to believe it
1	My first post , but I really need help with an ethical issue
1	I have a doctor that I want to fry
1	Here 's the story , 3 weeks ago I go in for an MRI , it 's a new private practice that my primary made me an appointment at
1	I go in everything is normal , I had a contrast MRI and there was some wait time for another MD to come over and give me the dye injection
1	The MD that was doing the MRI made conversation with me while I was waiting
1	It was professional , just about where I work , what I plan do with my lifesince I have a BS in Biology , he talks about his practice blah blah blah , just professional
1	I leave after it 's done Next day 1030pm I get a phone call on my cellphone , says private call , I do n't answer because I do n't answer calls like that , no voice mail , nothing
1	Hi my first name , this is his name , I was the person that did your MRI the other day , I was wondering if you 'd like to go out for a drink or coffee sometime , my number is cell phone , bye
1	Never get a call again , but this seriously disturbs me , for one I 'm a young guylegal age and he 's like 60 and an MD
1	This has to be reason to file him against the AMA , but what will most likely come from this
1	I have the message still , I have nt talked to him , besides him sending me a huge bill today
1	I do nt want this happening to other people , but I also do nt want some lengthy case that goes no where and leaves me wishing I never brought it to anyones attention
1	I 'm 13 and I think I 'm depressed
1	Ever since 2 years ago everything feels like I 'm just watching and ca n't do anything even with my family
1	I always feel tired , I feel like crying half the time for no reason , and as my friend said its like I 'm in my own world and that I need to open up and talk more
1	My friends have tried to help and I try to let them but before they can help I trick them into thinking I 'm ok when I 'm really not
1	I know I need to talk to someone I trust but I really do n't trust anyone
1	I do n't trust my mom because she found out from a spoused to be good friend that I thought I was worthless and thought the world would be a better place without me and the look on my mom 's face just stopped me and caused me to trick her too
1	I do n't really know any trusted adults because they will tell my mom
1	And all my friends not including two would judge me and put me down even more
1	And both of the two friends I ca n't talk to because they do n't have a phone or live anywhere near me
1	I mean it was hard for me to just post this
1	Pretty much I do n't want to disappoint my family because they think I 'm a little angle
1	People have tried to help but then they forget all about me and it just makes me feel even more worthless
1	And when it comes to making a choice of what 's my favorite my only choice is IDK because I do n't even know what I like anymore
1	I do n't know what to do or who I can trust
1	Hello all , Last year , i have been diagnosed with anxiety , which led to severe depression
1	I 'm on 10 mg cipralex a day , and 025 mg Xanax
1	Thing appear to be on an off , but if i have to compare , i am a way better than last year
1	Been passing through a rough time , joblessness family problems and all type of stresses you could thing off in a home where everyone thinks he is the boss
1	The thing is , all the problems occurred in the family house up in the mountains , and its like whenever i go there , i have this feeling of tension
1	Been fasting for a month , continuing with my medication
1	feeling spaced out happened to me the first week of fasting , and passed away and whenever i feel this way , i get anxious worrying to go back to depression , and fearing that something is going wrong in my head or i am getting crazy
1	The feeling of being in dream like state is what bothers me the most , and the fear that something is not right with me
1	Fasting ended , and the family had to spend the day in the family house , things was cool , but i was in constant tension , remembering all the bad events that occurred there and fearing that i might suffer what i suffered from last year
1	i am scared to go back to my depression
1	and whatever symptom i have , i get tensed
1	For the last 2 days i have been feeling spaced out , brain fog
1	contacted my doctor , he redid my tests , and told me that i am perfectly fine
1	and i should continue with my meds , and that fasting my cause this , even after fasting the body needs to regulate itself again
1	i woke up this morning , and i was fine , and little by little i started getting this brain fog , and fear
1	I watch my self a lot
1	knowing that socially , ppl love me , and i am active , and they notice nothing about my anxiety or feeling spaced out
1	i pray and wish that i 'll get back to what i was before
1	i drink , i do nt do drugs , i smoke tobaccobut once again , i am in constant family problems , financial problems , politically tensed and unstable country , everyone i see is very aggressive and and tensed all the time
1	i am single , 38 years old , sometimes i think , that getting married and living in my place will help me , knowing that i want to get married and have a family thanks for reading , and i appreciate your responses
1	I am preparing to exit my marriage from a man that has emotionally and verbally abused me for almost 12 years
1	We are buying a home together , have no children together , but I have 2 kids living with us
1	I also have 3 dogs and my oldest child , who is in college and lives with us , has 2 dogs also
1	I 've talked with my husband several times about divorce , but he simply will not agree to it
1	He has become extremely possessive and made references about suicide several times if we divorce , to the point that I 've removed the firearms from our home
1	I 've been told by my therapist and a counselor at a local womens shelter that I need to leave the house as soon as possible , but it 's not that simple for me
1	I have a teenager who is being affected by this , but she loves her step dad very much , and I hate to move her out of the comfort of her home
1	I know that a lot of people might consider this unimportant , but I also love my dogs too , and ca n't bear to part with them , and I 've been so isolated that I have no friends or family that I can leave them with so that I can get out , and I ca n't find a house or apartment to rent that will accept that many pets
1	Does anyone think that I have a chance of legally getting my husband to leave the house , so that I can stay , or should I leave and make some really heartbreaking decisions
1	I am a 19 yo female and For the past 7 months I have been experiencing very strange and disturbing symptoms that at this point I am convinced I am going to die within the year and go back and forth with these thoughts
1	It is important to note that have serious anxiety , have had it all my life but after a traumatic event i felt a slight sense of derealization or brain fog back in May
1	I immediately attributed this to a brain tumor and went to my GP and received a neurological exam , eye exams , and blood tests which came back as normal , attributed this to GAD
1	An MRI was not recommended and of course I was terrified of that so I have never had one
1	I had a serious neck injury several years ago that never truly healed and simultaneously was experiencing neck pain again so I started seeing a chiropractor and it was determined my C1 and C2 and lower spine as well were severely and moderately subluxated
1	Within 4 hours after the first adjustment , I felt a strange sensation in my inner cheek that I would describe as fullness , not necessarily numb
1	I continued going 2x a week all summer and eventually this same feel spread throughout the same side of my face
1	Concurrently , my anxiety has been getting much worse since and I have panic attacks fairly regularly and was recently prescribed xanax which is the only way I can stop thinking I m dyingUnfortnately , I attribute these attacks as being preseizures
1	Every day I think today will be the day of diagnosis , but I am too afraid to actually get an MRI because I 'd rather live in ignorance as long as possible before my life is ruined and given an expiration date
1	Current symptoms still allow me to live my life , I 'm in college , doing well , have friends , energy etc but this fear never leaves
1	The only hope I have is that its extremely strange all these symptoms began after I started seeing this chiro
1	I have not been to the chiro in weeks
1	  both eyes will intermittently just feel weird , pressure behind them   panic attacks , been obsessed with brain cancer since a girl i saw on the news died at 17 a few years ago
1	sometimes i can convince myself that I am experiencing nerve damage peripheral neuropathy or even psychosomatic symptoms
1	i really do n't want to die and every day I envision sitting in a doctors office being told I have stage 34 GBM or DIPG
1	So I just posted in the MedHelp suggestions forum about starting a hobbies club
1	I know for certain communities which deal with mood disorders and other emotional aspects , it would be nice for members to relate in a way that makes them feel good
1	Various Activities such as Book Clubs , Writers , MusicMusiciansCooking , Sewing , Fashion , Home , and some more was among what I had in mind
1	If this is something that would interest you , maybe you can post in the Medhelp Suggestions forum too
1	You are also free to add your own interests if you please
1	hi this website is very informative however at times I feel too far gone to regain any ground lost but going to start right now – was on heavy steroid treatment dextramethazone for brain surgery occurring at onset of menopause am 59 now – gained thirty plus kgs lost any desire for exercise or sex and struggle to have motivation – the cycle is a downward spiral but I feel a glimmer of hope now – I started maca mixed in with coconut yoghurt two weeks ago and now searching for a good supply of progesterone which I understand may help with the weight gain in mid section – my GP views my weight issue as related to diet only which is no help and confuses my digestives   the neurosurgeon avoids discussing any possible side effects that I had from the steroid treatment – so a very frustrating few years behind literally
1	Believe it or not I am pleased to read of other similar situations simply so I now know I am not alone – because I live with the part of tumour that was inoperable I try to keep exercise as controlled exertion to avoid possible fatal outcomes warned by neurologist although I do walk every day 610k upwards plus drink 23litres water – gluten free – vegetables raw or steamed mostly – no dairy and no caffeine off and on – it does make a difference to weight gain so started on dandelion tea , apple cider vinegar , ginger and ginseng recently for brain fog which has helped – I practice the intermittent fasting and lean toward Paleo – would like to consult with a good naturopath however have found my pockets empty and no results in the past so trying to do this myself now – any advice or comments gratefully received
1	I have been married nearly 20 years and have for several years now been concerned that something is wrong with my SO
1	While they did n't seem to be reflective of the actual situation they did seem to occur during times of stress , so I just chalked it up to that
1	I 'm to the point that I do n't know if I want to stick around but since we still have children at home , I am weighing my options carefully
1	Of note to add to my confusion I am referring to my husband and it seems there are far more females who are bpd , he holds a good job and has been there for over ten years
1	But on the bpd side He rages for no apparent reason or at least disproportionally to the situation He goes through good phases and then phases where everything you do is wrong He never takes responsibilitywhen he does something it 's because I somehow made him He does n't take criticism well
1	He finds something wrong or annoying about every person he meets He gaslights everything
1	He projects on me and occasionally at others He is also and maybe more so a bit narcissistic
1	He spends hours getting ready , looks in every mirror he goes by , has to be the center of attention
1	He exaggerates stories sometimes to the point that I do n't even recognize them when he 's telling them
1	He 's taken credit for things I 've done and others have done
1	He always discount others contributions and overstates his own
1	And , honestly I 've begun to wonder if it 's me who 's crazy
1	I 've tried now for years to make him happy and make things even keel but it does n't really seem to matter what I do or do n't do
1	In fact he 's told me if I left he would n't ever come after me
1	Which , of course , left me confused , hurt and then turned afraid that I would be alone although this is sounding better and better
1	He does not abuse any substances He is not suicidal or hurt himself He will never go to therapy so I will never get a formal diagnosis but would like to know if it sounds like I may be dealing with some level of bpd and whether I can improve the situation
1	I want to do what 's right by him , my children and myself but I feel like I 'm turning into a shell of a person and he 's made me believe that I am not capable of functioning in the world
1	My biggest fear is the damage I may have done or will do to my children if I stay or go
1	This is a very hard question for me to ask or to even talk about because I 'm such a private person
1	But this has been bothering me for years and I just woke up again from a sound sleep , jumping out of bed and screaming for absolutly no reason
1	I 've been in therapy since my sister ended her life many years back
1	I recently took a few years break and returned about two months ago because of some health problems which ended up with my having to leave my job which I reallt loved and having alot of time on my hands I 'm not used to having
1	For as far back as I can remember I 've had a fear of going to sleep
1	Awful nightmares that leave me confused at LEAST twice a week even still nearing my 30 's
1	I ca n't sleep in the dark because I feel it leaves me defensless against something happeningI have no idea what
1	It seems I ca n't get myself into a deep enough sleep , like I 'm always prepared to jump and runalways
1	And after 24 years of this I 'm exhausted
1	My husband jokes that he wo n't get up to use the bathroon in the middle of the night because even a squeek in a floor board will jolt me awake and into a panic
1	I knew about sex very early on before I asked my mother about it
1	But when I finally asked her I covered my ears and could n't stand to listennormal for a kid right , I thought so
1	In my early years up until a jounior in HS I avoided boys but suddenly after my first boyfriend pressured me into sex , really pressured me , I became promiscuise after we broke up
1	I was promiscouse until I was about 22
1	The one that most concerns me is my abdominal pain
1	I became embarassed to watch any TV or even movies that had any sexual conintation in it with my husband
1	Every time he rests against my abdomen even lightly , the pain shoots up
1	Every time he comes close to my vaginal area I feel so uncomfortable and the pain also starts
1	My first therapist continuely asked me if I had been abused
1	No matter what I said she would always imply that she thought so but was careful not to force the issue
1	A few friends have asked me , even a shoddy psychic I went to see as a gag with some girlfriends asked me
1	Cut to two months ago when it had been years since thinking about what these people thoughtthe FIRST appointment I had with this therapist , the very FIRST and she asked me if I had been abused as a child
1	I asked her why she asked and she said because everything I was explaining was indicitive of a sexual abuse victim
1	In all honesty , I have NEVER seen this in myself but everyone around me has so clearly
1	As if I have a sticker on my forehead that says so
1	I keep saying I do n't remember anything
1	I would n't even know anyone who would do this to me
1	I love my family so much and could n't imgaine that
1	And that 's what I 've been saying for 10 yearsif this has happened I do n't want to know who
1	I want to keep loving everyone I love and not have any bad feeling twords anyone
1	I ca n't have sex with my husband and he 's so patient but I feel so horrible
1	These health problems , the therapist thinks they 're real but that past trauma is exasterbating them
1	The pain I 'm feeling now has flickered at latent memories and physical sensations I do n't remember or have blocked and thus in my mind without realizing it I 'm cutting off the only thing I cansex , to try and stop the physical pain
1	I 'm suddenly embarassed by sex because I 'm having past feeling I ca n't pinpoint arise that remind me of the shame and embarassment
1	How have I not seen thishow am I in the mental health field and not seen this
1	I 'm almost 30 and feel like a scared little girl for reasons I ca n't understand
1	Also , I 'm tired of jumping from my sleep ready to run
1	I was on ambient and klonopin about 5 years ago
1	Should I maybe go back on them
1	Hello about two years ago I began dating a girl whom I came to love VERY much
1	She was very fit , funny , charming and put on the appearance of Martha Stewart as far as domestic skills go
1	She told me how nice it was to connect with someone who gets her
1	Within the first few weeks she seemed a bit quirky , childish at times in her demeanor almost like dealing with a sad child
1	Other times she was angry as if she was having a bad day
1	Several ocassions I had to come to the rescue for her , such things as her having intense heartburn in the middle of the night required me to bring her medicine or her computer breaking or her getting lost
1	I enjoy helping people and to help someone I loved and cared for was even better
1	I also began to notice how chaotic her home was becoming , clothes tossed about , could never find keys , doors always unlocked , you were lucky not to trip on a laptop when locking in the front door
1	After getting to know her I learned a few things
1	She had attempted suicide a year and a half earlier when a former lover left her and she was bulimic
1	Once again these things somewhat concerned me but she was seeing a therapist and I loved her either way
1	A few months into our relationship a long term work contract she had was ending and we spent a great deal of time together , in fact every night after she lost her job
1	She would job hunt at my house and I would work from home
1	About 6 months into the relationship her constant mood swings and unfounded anger caused me to take pause and I asked her about it
1	Our sex life had somewhat diminished and I was have mixed feelings about where this was headed
1	About a week into the break she contacted me frantically in the middle of the night stating that someone had stolen her car
1	I rushed to her house to wait for the police with her since she lives very close
1	We went 35 months without sexual contact
1	She spoke with her physician she had quit seeing her psychologist when her insurance stopped coverage who took her off of birth control
1	He put her on welbutrin about a month before we broke up before good , after this we had sex a few times
1	After we broke up which was mutual we contacted each other on occasion
1	I told her that I missed her she would come back and say that we should be just friends
1	She was very insistant that we remain friends
1	I would cut contact then she would contact me after several days
1	This began to confuse me and my attempts to express my feelings of how bad I missed her became more frequent
1	Finally I decided to give up and I ended up in therapy myself
1	Our last conversation before I gave up consisted of her telling me she was not attracted to me , our relationship was a lie , she is seeing someone now who makes her feel special etc
1	I had not experienced this much anger directed to me by her previously
1	I stopped talking to her and felt great after about 4 weeks of mixed sadness and longing
1	Then it happened , she contacts me again
1	A text in the middle of the night , I ask her why she said she was very lonely
1	Slowly but surely we worked our way up to going to lunch , her original request was drinks but I set the boundary at lunch
1	Of course we ate lunch and then ooops , she had no money , rescue me again
1	I felt strong this first time and did nt let my feelings get in the way and kept it very friendly
1	Two days later it was lets get ice cream followed by going to her house and chatting for a long time about our lives over the last month or so
1	She was very interested in my love life
1	The following week I was to help her with some household items
1	When i arrived at her house she was in a towel fresh out of the shower asking me to apply lotion on her
1	At this point we were constantly texting each other throughout the day
1	When we were together she was constantly texting her friends
1	2 weeks later she spent the night at my house
1	I did make a small advance at her at this point and held her in her sleep
1	The next morning my feelings in a whirlwind I asked her where we were going with this
1	She said we were friends and this was a bad time to talk about this
1	I told her I could n't handle being friends and that we should n't be doing this as friends
1	4 days pass she is texting me again , I respond nicely and resumed no contact
1	Several days later she texts me frantically with something she had broken at her house , i told her that I could not come right away it would have to be tomorrow she said it would have to wait til later in the week then since she was busy
1	The next morning her schedule had magically changes at I was at her house fixing something she had broken surprise
1	I told her at this point how foolish I felt doing this stuff when she obviously was stringing me along , once again she was texting someone
1	I asked her if it was the person whom she was seeing , she said yes
1	I asked if he knew I was there and she said that she did nt need to divulge that information to him
1	That was it , I reluctantly finished what I was doing and left
1	Does this sound like someone whom may have issues with BPD , she is from a broken home
1	Her father has been through a string of marriages while she lived between her parents homes
1	I worry its just a matter of time before she is contacting me again
1	Its hard for me because I love her and would do anything for her , I feel like I am under some kind of mind control
1	Sorry for the novel , at this point I do nt want to continue to drive myself crazy and I do nt want to be a complete ah to someone whom may or may not genuinely need my assistance
1	I 'm up and down in my beliefs with this Disorder
1	I do have a rather more upsetting think when I suddenly realise that I could ' really ' have this illness
1	Often m y behaviour has exhausted others and rather than blame it on my unique , nutty but laughable personalityI'm just ' sick in the head ' with a mental health disorder called ' Borderline Personality Disorder '
1	My partner knows a bit about it now , even my knowledge of it now makes it hard to comfortably justify my ' unstable ' ways as I laugh and say ' I 'd just be so boring if I behaved ' normally '
1	I also say to my partner that he would n't have me any other way
1	I 've recently badly selfharmed and am struggling more and more to get through each day
1	My partner has spent time away from me because of the strains
1	I feel so guilty I 'm draining the life out of the poor man
1	We have been together for 14 years
1	BUT , I am obsessed with trying to make every man I meet , falling in love with me
1	Example , I was on twitter and this guy was complaining about love , so I replied
1	The very moment I re tweeted him , I got a raging jealousy because he was talking about being in love with another woman
1	I have never met him before in my life , yet I need him to fall in love with me
1	Why do I feel the need to try and make every man I know , fall in love with me
1	I never cheat on my man , but I love to flirt and manipulate a man
1	I have been told that I may have a personality disorder that fits these symptoms
1	I am 18 years old and this all started about 2 years ago when I met my husband to be
1	I started to get extremely depressed when I would see other teens or women pregnant , and when I started having unprotected sex and I was n't getting pregnant , I started to worry and now I ca nt help but want to be pregnant
1	I am 15 now and have been going through depression for the last 5 years
1	From first i had no friends i was a very good student and got straight A 's
1	I had this positive spirit in me
1	I was just doing fine until i got mentally harassed by some girls at school
1	They first pretended to be my friends but their true intention was to torture me
1	They used to call me names And humiliate me
1	My mom neglected me at first
1	She had her own issues at work and with my dad
1	Everyday i sat and wondered if something was wrong with me that made all my fellow classmates hate me
1	Every single one of them hated me
1	If i went to maybe borrow something they would make those ignorant faces
1	I was always trying to act kind and helpful towards everyone but when i walked towards them they just walked away
1	They wo n't let me play with them and say ' go away we do nt need you '
1	At last when i told my mom she said to ignore them and just smile on what they say then they will leave you alone
1	I did what she said
1	I still remember that day when i was sitting right infront in the middle row doing my homework when those girls came and sat behind me
1	They started saying these reaplly bad things about me
1	when i tried 5o ignore and laugh like my mother said , one of them started pulling my hair and even slapped me several times
1	One of them bullied and the other one who controlled her laughed
1	I was n't able to hold my emotions and broke down that day
1	After two years the bullying stopped when my mother finally complained
1	It is true that when you have no one to talk to your mind starts talking a lot
1	I became aware of my senses and asked the same things over and over again
1	It was like i was going crazy and naive , i lost interest in everything , i even lost my appetite
1	With GREAT EFFORT i overcame it but it is still within me and sometimes htries to have an impact
1	I even got some health issues like acidity , dehydration when i completely fainted and had to be taken to the hospital due to low blood pressure , got UTI infection which went uPTO more than 150hpf , allergic asthama when suddenly i was finding it so diffulty breathing at night it was the worst feeling ever
1	i almost thought i would die at some point i had to struggle so much and my parents had to stay awake all night with mebut when i got myself diagnosed my doctpr said there was nothing
1	I often feel bad about myself , my grades have lowered , i oversleep , have mood swings and much prefer to be isolated in my room
1	Its become so worse that i have even got into cutting my ownself
1	I know its bad but i feel so bad about myself
1	My mom has no idea about the cuttings but i tol her that i need a therapist
1	Her reaction to this was naive she says its all a phase of life and it would end soon on its own
1	I do nt get out much because of lack of friendship and i just do nt like to be around people anymore
1	Sometimes i feel like getting out of thid place And live somewhere else where no one know 's me and start a new lifeall my friends who were not truly my friends were toxic and ignorant and i have promised myself that i would never make up with such fake friends
1	I would be better off without them
1	I have a few questions I need answered
1	I went out drinking with my friend and I have schizophrenia
1	Well the night I went drinking I missed my dose of risperdal came back the next day hungover but I was n't hearing any voices yet
1	Then around 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon I still had n't taken meds and I started to hear the voices that I had the first time I had when I was diagnosed they basically came back
1	I took my risperdal which did help with the voices but did not completely get rid of them it 's been two days and the voices are very faint but I can still hear them
1	So my question is do I have to go back to the er again or will they go away after a while since the meds do seem to be helping
1	I 'm just scared because I do n't want to get locked up again in the mental institution since I know now that I 'm really schizophrenic
1	My second question is is this going to increase my dose of risperdal or medication that I 'm going to ' ve on
1	I know I 'm stupid for drinking but I did n't take my pills because I thought the mix of risperdal would be bad for my kidneys
1	I did n't know one day of drinking and missed dose of meds could do this
1	I just recently diagnosed schizophrenic and the voices are tolerable since they 're faint but I 'm sad they 're back and worried they wo n't go away
1	I have a doctor 's appointment next month if I tell her the voices are back will I get put away or should I keep this to myself
1	They 're not so bad but they are upsetting
1	Hi everyone I 've been on ADs for years and recently started seroxat paroxetine and I 'm on 20 mg now it 's the 4th day and this is going on Mood swings but have period so could be cause as well as my cat who is ill at the moment so am vworried Sweating but chills as well Abdominal pains Most of all INSOMNIA
1	And I have to take diazepam to help but I do n't want o get used to this stuff as I know it can be incredibly habit forming
1	When I run out of them , I 'll be tempted to ask for more but I think that 's not wise
1	I go swimming every day and walk loads , but this AD is provoking the insomnia
1	The Zoloft I took before did nothing hence why I 'm on this
1	And I 've already had the relevant Stronger SNRIs before which worked well but were not physically good for my body so I had to swap to SSRIs
1	I know it could be worse and there are bigger issues than mine out there so I wo n't go on and on , I just wana kno if anyone 's on this drug and what can expected
1	I 've been through a lot in the past few years , and I believe it has taken a toll on my mental health
1	If I do one little thing stupid , like if I 'm running late for something I 'll constantly remind myself after and tell myself how stupid I am and I should kill myself
1	I believe I had a mental break down of some sort on the night I attempted suicide
1	And I tired to end my life
1	I keep wondering if I would of been better of if I really did die
1	But lately this has gotten really bad and I constantly just want to cry and kill myself and I hate it
1	It like there an evil side to me that hates my guts
1	Depression and anxiety runs through my family , but I 've never had the guts to talk about this to anyone
1	Could someone please help me I do n't know what to do anymore
1	I 've seen phycologists and neuropsychologists and all sorts of things , but I 've never been able to open up
1	I feel like nobody knows me
1	I 'm only 15 , I know I have a whole life ahead of me , but I just Do n't see the point
1	last week on his thirteenth birthday my son was left alone with my friends four year old son for about an hr
1	my son is a young just turned 13 year old
1	still in primaryelementary school after we went home that night , my friends son told my friend that my son had touched him with his penis etc
1	my friend rang me crying and screaming this down the phone , as i was driving home , thru the countryside so my son heard this this way
1	my son since then and at the time , denies that he did any of the things the boy has said
1	anyway , we had an interview with child protection and they were alos told the same of what happened that evening , by my son
1	now my situation is   my son may be lying , does nt appear to be and is behaving just like his nice natural self
1	if my son did this , it is almost certain that he has been abused himself as this behaviour is not something age appropriate
1	if he did nt well just being accused could be damaging to him
1	i need to get counselling myself   i am in a paramedical profession , i want counselling for myson but i do nt want him to think i do nt belive him
1	that is the short version i am extremely devastated , have had to postpone my clientsand patients this past week , and have nt really known where to turn
1	i live alone with my son and part time with my daughter who has just turned 20 she is due home tomorrow
1	my son has not lived with his dad since he was a baby and does nt have contact with him , his dads choice
1	my son has had a nice childhood regardless of this , he goes to a Waldorf school , plays games and some sport , not a dvd watcher , not a computer user anyway thankyou , in advance anna
1	Whenever I get very angry or deeply frustrated , I want to bite someone until they cry out in pain
1	It 's not just the bite I want to do , but I have this need to hear the cry of pain from the other person
1	It 's like I want to hear them beg me to stop and to tell me it hurts
1	This really , REALLY scares the holy   out of me , because normally , I never want to hurt anybody
1	I 've caught myself looking at my cat 's scruff , and when I realize what I 'm thinking about , I break out in tears , and I have to go curl up and cry myself to sleep
1	There 's a few things you might want to know first 1 I am a survivor of psychological and verbal abuse with small spatterings of physical abuse from my grandmother
1	2 I deal with high levels of pain in my body and am severely overweight , to the point that I can barely walk
1	3 I frequently have bouts of tears , where I cry for no reason
1	4 I do not have medical insurance , so do n't tell me to go get help
1	I 'm 14 and only in the last months have I began feeling strange
1	Before then , I was a happy and usually positive person as I have been my whole life
1	I have always been an over thinker and a worrier but only about general things – nothing like how I feel now
1	We were told I had flu and sinusitis and I got antibiotics
1	However , since I have recovered I feel like something has changed
1	I have cried too many times and I feel terrified
1	One night everything felt so abnormal and weird , as though my world had been turned upside down and I was living in a distorted new way , I feel trapped
1	I do n't know what this all is but people just assume I have anxiety
1	I have recently started having weird dreams and nightmares and when I wake up , it is hard to separate what is real and what was a dream
1	I feel broken and almost like my life has changed forever
1	I get scary feelings and the expiriences I have are now related with this feeling , making me dread places
1	I have lost control of my mind
1	I have lost my perspective of places I used to feel comfortable in
1	I feel like fear is shadowing my life , but there is nothing I can do
1	Please help me , I have run out of options
1	I 'm not dumb , but am I smart
1	When I look at my results I think I need to change
1	You can get judged and critiqued so easily if you got left behind or lost track and that is just what happened to me
1	You see I felt sick and had no motivation for schoolwork , I lost track in many subjects and I accumulated absences
1	The doctors thought I was physically sick and so did I for a while
1	In December I was getting really fed up , I had not been feeling well for about a year , and I wanted change
1	I started thinking a lot , about what I was doing , my emotions , habits , frequencies and came to the conclusion that I was depressed
1	The problem is that you start making habits and they become hard to break
1	I decided that I needed to change
1	I also asked myself why are you making a cocoon , an area of safety , a net around yourself
1	I feel judged , I ca n't trust anybody to be honest or tell the truth and I guess I lack selfconfidence
1	My grades are poor , I do n't have much motivation and am not very close with my classmates , I feel sort of awkward , not liked Also I have to take subjects that I have fallen behind in and do not appreciate
1	You see , I moved to Switzerland when I was eight and never really felt like I fitted in
1	My parents say I have the best friends I could possibly want but to me it does n't seem like that
1	I feel as if even they think thoughts of critique about me behind my back and that I ca n't trust them with much
1	My parents have made appointments for me to see guidance counselors and a therapist
1	They seem to think that paying somebody for me to talk to will completely help me out and that I have no need to move , that my project to leave is just because I 'm sick of Switzerland and not because I do n't fit in
1	I do n't feel confident enough to go to therapy because I feel as if , like in previous experiences with therapists , I will think I 'm being critiqued in their mind
1	I do n't know what to do but I really need change
1	I can hardly eat at present and I do n't see a need for me to stick around in this world anymore
1	the above content is from my ct scan reportcan anybody tell what the report says and on what stage i am now
1	Hi there I have had a hard immovable lump behind my ear for 4 and a bit years in the groove between the mastoid bone and the back of my skull and its not a lymph node or anything else it is a fleshy hard lump
1	I 've been to see many doctors about this and when I was in A and E not too long ago I had a doctor who had worked in oncology and studied cancers under the microscope and I told her my worries about a type of cancer called a sarcoma and she explained to me how from what she could feel and the nature of the lump that she did n't think it was cancer at all and that she thought since the mastoid bone is n't actually part of the skull that when I 've been growing up tha the mastoid bone has impacted with my skull slightly and that the lump is impacted tissue that has been pushed out the way
1	And she also said as my blood tests were perfectly normal and that the lump had not chanced or grown in any way shape or form in over 4 years she was n't worried
1	I have also had other doctors tell me the same as it has been there 4 years and not changed not to worry
1	They do n't even want to send me for scans and expose me to radiation i do n't need according to them yet they all tell me that some lymph nodes in my neck are swollen they are still not worried
1	I am still going to ask my GP as he said the next time he sees me that if I am still anxious he will send me up to someone at ENT and they can have a look but they still wo n't probably give me any scans
1	I know the lump has n't changed and tbh it 's smooth I do n't know if that makes any difference but it 's been the same for 4 and a half years and I 'm just mainly worried because I have quite large lymph nodes in the area also so could this be cancerous
1	I 've been sad for most of my nights latelyI lie down and become emotionally broken over any disappointing thing about my life and even think about suicideI would never do itit 's more of a temptation , like when I want to push an alarm button whenever I pass one but I know doing so would be nothing but bad , so I prevent myself from doing so , despite my strong urges
1	I know that depression is something that is simply therethat it 's not an act or phase or sicknessBut I do n't know what it 's likeI'm worried that I might become depressed , or that I am becoming depressed , and if I do , I'll find life less enjoyable than it used to be
1	What I 'm sad about the most is my lack of friends , and my lack of ability to make friendsBear with me for a long story , pleaseI'm giving details from the beginning
1	I suppose when I was younger , I always wanted to have friendsever since fifth grade , I never could make a handful of them and I could n't keep the ones I did makethe friend I made in fifth grade moved away once summer came , then I was friendless for about two years until I made a friend when I had to repeat seventh grade , and I made a best friend through that friend the next year , which I then had a happy little group of four friendsI was never sad , however , because I enjoyed myself a lot with social computer games , whenever I was n't with my school friends , and I had some fun friends from such games at that timeI moved to another school the following summer and lost my friends , including the temporary ones I had made through the games I played because I stopped playing computer gamesIt was around that time that I had sadness over being lonely for the first timeHowever , I made many wonderful friends in school after three monthsMy life started picking up again , and I met my first boyfriend at the end of the yearEverything was great until I lost my appetite and started to starve myself to lose a satisfying about of weighteven though I was not overweightIt worked , but my boyfriend found out and was n't happy about itI agreed to not do it againI never have starved myself since then , but I have n't been able to regain my appetiteI still do n't enjoy food muchAfter some months , I became jealous of my boyfriend 's social lifeIt seemed like he had always had friends that have been with him for his whole life , since he stayed in the same small town and school for his entire life , and for his family 's entire lifeI began to realise that such a friendship exists and I wished I had thatI never did   I moved every year before finally settling down in middle schoolMy Junior year in high school came , my boyfriend 's Senior year , and the only friends I made in my own grade moved awayThe rest of my friends were graduatingI realised that I do n't have friends in my own grade and I would have a very lonely Senior year , and so it wasThe only person I talked to that year was my boyfriend , whom I was able to see at least once a month , snce he was in college , whenever he came to me on weekendsHe would tell me wonderful things he would do with the new friends he metthe silly Youtube videos they showed him that made him laugh so hard , the jokes they made , the games they playedI was glad he was happy , but I was just getting more sad about my own situationMy cat died in the middle of the year , sometime before Christmas weekI spent most of my time with her and she was my companion at home for ten yearsI loved her very much and I still doBut after I lost her , I had no one to spend time withI was completely lonely and I was never happy , not even when getting reassurance from my boyfriend through texts , for two weeksThe time came for me to go to college , and my hopes were so high about meeting new peopleIt was a new environment , new people , new me , no more being so introvertedI was excitedHere I am now , with only one friend out of the three fun people I met at orientationNever talking to the two other people that I met brings me downI would think , What would I be doing if I had met them again , instead of staying in my boyfriend 's dorm most of my time
1	I want to make friends , but every night I come to realise , How am I supposed to make friendsI do n't play video gamesI do n't watch many showsI ca n't strike up a conversation about interests with anyone
1	I do n't think I 'm an interesting person , and I believe I wo n't make any friendsI think about this , and about how tough college is becoming on my parent 's paycheck , and I just want to find something , anything , to kill myselfBut I 'm glued to my bed , and I know I do n't really want to do itI fall asleep to my own sadnessI talked to my boyfriend about itIt was just like when he found out about me starving myselfhe said to not consider suicide again , that it 's not allowed , and having memories to look back on is something to be happy aboutBut I realised that I 'm never happy anymore
1	Why am I never as happy as I used to be
1	I just ca n't get as excited about things as I used toI'm happy when I find a way to have fun with someoneBut I never enjoy nature as much as I used toI used to draw and go outside and pull my boyfriend out on long walks at night and be so awestruck at the moon 's beauty and the night 's cool breezeI ca n't imagine that happiness anymoreThe last time I remember doing so was before December 2013I ca n't even find happiness in the things I 'm thankful forThat is what worries me the mostI'm not overall happy anymoreHave I lost itAm I never going to be able to make myself happy again and I 'll need someone to bring my happiness to me , for it to be taken back when that person has to leaveShould I talk to a doctor or get a therapistI do n't know what depression is like , but I 'm scared that I might find out , and I 'm afraid that there 's no way to go backI want to be happy again
1	And I need some advice because my best friend is going through alot
1	Mental , Verbal   Physical Abuse I have tried various things to help her and her family
1	Her Dad , the other parent who is nt abusive and is trying to get full custody He tr   More eats me like I 'm his own child
1	But the mother also has a new husband , and he is basically telling her what to say to my friend and just influencing the mother even more
1	A few days ago , My friend and I went to a halloween store and picked out a costume and EVERYTHING
1	We spent over 100 on each costume , which the dad happily had payed , he said it was a gift to us because he just loved us
1	When I went to school , My friend was nt there
1	Her mother and her stepdad had kept her home on her father 's visitation , so that her father could n't get her
1	When her father went to their house , Her mother and her stepdad were holding my friend against her will , and they said they would not let her go , until the father signed a paper saying that THEY could have her for halloween
1	And yet , today is halloween , and I have to spend it without my best friend
1	He also takes us fourwheeling almost every weekend
1	My father left me when I was three
1	And her father made me feel like I had a father again
1	My friend however , when her parents got divorced when she was seven , she completely just fell apart
1	I 've known her for four years , since the fourth grade
1	She never really could trust me at first to tell me what was going on at her mother 's house
1	Her mom beats her and her sister
1	Her sister is 15 , and yet she still has to lay on her mom 's knee and get her rear smacked
1	Her mom also slaps them
1	When my friend was younger , her mother used a paddle
1	So now , I completely understand why she would do such things
1	Even the first time I went over there , he never greeted or smiled at me and my mother
1	He 's got some muscle , but he has a scar running down his face
1	But , rumors ' going around saying that he had lit my friend 's puppy on fire with gasoline
1	But there are things worse he could do to my friend
1	That s why I want her out of that house
1	Her step dad has called her multiple things
1	She has very low self esteem already , and as if she needed this to happen
1	I have risked my life so many times for her
1	Her mom and her step dad are very addicted to prescription pills
1	So , my friend told me where they hid them
1	While they were in their room , I snuck out in the kitchen , and looked through their cabinets
1	They had maybe over 20 empty pill bottles that were all prescribed maybe about a week before
1	And I just feel like this is even more of a threat to my friend 's life
1	Dayna the mother and Jack the step dad called me a spy , and that they applauded me for my great acting
1	They also said they wanted to brainwash my friend , have they gone crazy
1	They have already been to court , maybe twice in the past two months
1	What can I tell my friend
1	I 've already told her not to be afraid to stand up to them What should I do about Dayna and Jack
1	So first off sorry for my english its not my native language also get ready for a long readcause u get the full story i hope for some good helpadvice cause noone in other forums seems to take me serious   OK so now i will explain how my problems came to be i try to keep it short but that s not really possible because i wanna give you guys the most detailed view on the situation for some advise or in the best case someone that expirienced similar things and can tell me its going to go away
1	it was april 2014 was feeling good and just minded my own things i used to smoke some weed every now and then not really much like 12x every week at best sometimes nothing for 23weeks then my holidays came and i had 2 weeks off so i wanted to celibrate with my friends got myself some 25i nbome its a drug with similar effects to lsd the first time i took it after like 34 months did nt really feel good i was kinda off in my head turned on rihanna usually i never listen to her but oh well seemed right for that time the trip was not horrible but not really what i wanted it to beso the next day i desided to try it again and this time it was perfect loved everything about it ate some chillis they tasted like rainbows
1	these 2 trips took place right after eachother then i had a 3 day break my friend had some XTC or MDMA crystals at first i was scared to take them we all met for smoke a couple joints but noone really had the guts to take the molly so i took it home with me at about 21 o clock i desided to just take it whatever while still being a little high from the weed
1	the high was great i have never felt something like this before i was filled with love just laying in bed not moving atall after 2 hours the high seemed to go away so i took a little more not really much that was the time i desided to write the girl i was always in love with yeah i know how stupid that sounds but i did it wrote such a long text at 12 at night lol the high was gone i felt fine could even sleep well the next day i woke up feeling a little off but that s to be expected so its all good till now this day my friends call me and say yooo lets smoke some weed and well since i have nothing better to do except playing video games i said yes while still feeling drained smoked like 23gs with 3 people all good at night my head starts to hurt really bad i had that about 23 time before so i just taught meh and went to bed this is where it gets wierd
1	I m 43 years old and have been having problems with my periods
1	I will be a month late , or sometimes even 3 months late
1	My baby boys father passed away in 2004 and I stayed single for at least 8 yrs
1	After awhile of being alone , my family thought it was time for me to move on with my life , so I decided to start dating again
1	well I meet this great man and ever since we started having intercourse
1	I cry almost every night over things that happened years ago
1	Last year I only had 6 periods
1	I know i m not pregnant
1	I have taken at least 15 pregnancy test over the past three years and all negative
1	Sex has been painful for me , but I was assuming it was because I did n't have sex for almost 8 yrs
1	My family moved to a different country , I feel alone , I do nt like my body
1	I 'm just a huge mess , my life is a mess
1	Since we moved here , I have been sad I miss my friends and my family
1	Whenever I try to talk to my parents about my feelings , they just ignore me , or try to talk abut something else
1	I 've been trying so hard to adjust to my new life , but it seem imposible to try to fit where you do n't belong
1	I feel so alone , nobody understands me , I do n't know what to do
1	it is obvious that if you want to talk to someone , you should go talk to your mom or dad , but I ca n't
1	I just do n't know what I did to deserve the life I have
1	Yes , I know that I have to be grateful because I have a beautiful family , and nice friends , clothes , food , etc
1	but I just do n't like my life
1	I started watching YouTube videos , and yeah , I love Youtubers and One Direction
1	I think that they are the only people in the world right now that an make me happy
1	But now my parents do n't want me watching videos all day
1	I have good grades in school , I do my homework , I am responsible , why do they want to take away my happiness
1	I also have socal anxiety , and i just ca n't
1	I have a list of all my flaws , nobody is perfect , but I 'm certanly a huge mistake
1	I have been trough a lot , and I ca n't find someone to talk to
1	My parents know that I do n't like it here , but still they think I 'm happy
1	If I could , I would move back to my birth country , where I do fit , where I feel happyBUt you know what
1	I ca n't , and that s my life
1	What should I say to my parents
1	How can I deal with my anxiety and sadness
1	Calling my father the Antichrist is such a gross understatement
1	He molested me , beat me , emotionally abused me , everything throughout my childhood
1	And where I ’m at now is I ’m 26 , and have never been able to hold down a job or a man thanks to flashbacks I keep having of him
1	My current job is in huge jeopardy , and I am about to take him to court to file for civil damages
1	He 's worth millions of dollars , while my financial situation is tragic , at one point I had to work in the adult industry just to keep a roof over my head , even further adding to the feelings that my only purpose in this world is to be a communal blowup doll for men
1	I tried to press criminal charges , but the detective never got back to me
1	And it ’s disturbing that I get flashbacks at work , which make me seem crazy and get fired , plus I want a daughter so badly which is unlikely , seeing as every time I get with a man , well , I know what it ’s like to be used as a blowup doll and have completely given up on ever knowing what it feels like to be made love to
1	I ’m writing this because SOOOOOOOOOO many people have told me “ Get over it ” , “ Do n’t let it affect you ” , etc , but no one has told me exactly HOW to do any of this
1	I have tried over 20 therapists , and all they have wanted to do is dwell on the past and not give me any direction on how to move forward
1	Besides , how am I supposed to absorb any advice they give me when I am so emotional from talking about it
1	So , for me , counselling is not an option , as it is a huge waste of my time and money , money being something I do n’t have much of as I ca n’t seem to hold down a job
1	I am open to other options like NLP , hypnotherapy , etc , and am very curious about peoples’ experiences with these kinds of therapies
1	I have been on medication before , and I am not going there again , no ifs ands or buts , every time I felt so doped up to the point where I could n't think clearly
1	Also , please do n’t tell me anything along the lines of “ Go to church ” , I am spiritual but I find organized religion to be oppressive and selfpitying
1	I am so much more of the mindset that we are meant to work for our salvation , not pray and sit back waiting for it
1	Right now , it feels as if I ’ll only truly be over this abuse if and when I achieve the 2 things I ’ve been deprived of because of this , a stable job and a stable marriage
1	Thank you for your time
1	I really ca n't cope i feel like a monster and iv'e let everyone down such as familyfriends to this day
1	in my early years , life was amazing with my family going on vacation and being brought up well , i went o church and was an alter boy
1	we had a dog which my father rescued from abusers
1	The dog sadly passed away a few years later when i was maybe 810
1	When i was either 1112 or younger i was talked and went with the idea of practicing sexual acts with another male friend and he used to say Let 's pretend i 'm the girl that you 're getting on in school
1	What happens a year or so later fulls me greatly with extreme guilt and depression and confusion
1	When i was 13 we got a new dog and at this time i went through stages of humping objects like my bed or pillows i believe i was going through puberty until for some reason i placed my self on top of my dog to then lay on top like dryhumping i did this on and off for over 2 years as if i was enjoying it and i felt i could get away with it because it was amazing i had no idea what i was setting my life for doing these actsit all stopped after having traumatic break down and i promised myself this must stop
1	My parents use to argue a lot and i witnessed a lot of physical violence for many years through out all this happening by the way
1	I 'm now 26 , traveled different countries , have had sexual relationships with women never lasted because of what has happened   and i have a secure job but I feel a heavy weight in my head of guilt and depression and worry
1	I want to live a normal life and be happy , but i feel i 've blown it and i 'm concerned for my future of it getting worse in my head
1	i have just laid out all my confessions and i need help please
1	The first time I took Sertraline was 6 years ago for chronic fatigue , low energy and brain fog after having a bad stomach virus
1	My doc prescribed 50 mg , but after the first dose I had terrible side effects
1	She then told me to take half the pill
1	I took the 25 mg for a few months , then increased to 50 mg for a short time before tapering off
1	I was only on Sertraline for about 7 months , and then my life was back to normal
1	Now , after dealing with stress and another stomach viruswhich I had 3 months ago , I 'm experiencing the same symptoms again
1	I also discovered I have a severe vitamin D deficiency
1	My doc prescribed vitamin D2 50,000IU and Sertraline25 mg
1	I have been on the Sertraline for a week now , but my reaction to the medication is different this time around
1	I 'm experiencing insomnia , tingling sensations in my hands and head , nausea , feeling spaced out and a lower mood
1	Could I be having these side effects because 25 mg is too high of a dose for me
1	I am a 13 year old girl living in Denmark though I lived in California until I was six and a half
1	I do realize that this is quite a long post , and I ’ve tried to shorten it , but obviously I ’m not very good at that
1	For a long time   I honestly ca n’t say when it started   I ’ve been feeling pretty down , and I do n’t really remember the last time I felt happy for an entire week
1	I mean , one day I can be really happy , but the next day I just want to crawl up in my bed and be numb
1	I do n’t know what ’s going on , and it frightens me
1	I really do n’t get why I feel like this
1	Unlike so many others who feel sad for a longer time , I do have close friends , I have n’t ever been bullied , no recent tragedies have happened in my life , and without meaning to brag , I ’m one of the best in my class
1	So you see , I do n’t really have a reason to be sad , but that just makes me feel even sadder , because that must mean that I ’m totally pathetic and stupid for being sad in the first place
1	I even write fantasy stories myself , and frankly , I live more in a fantasy world than in the real world
1	A lot of the time , I ’m sad because I ca n’t “ reach ” the other worlds
1	I ’m sad because I do n’t know of magic
1	Because I ’m just a normal little naïve girl , with no special powers , but spends most of my time imagining and wishing I did
1	I ’m an epic Potterhead , Harry Potter is my life , but I ca n’t count how many times I ’ve cried because I ’m not a part of that world
1	I do n’t know , I do n’t really have reason to hate myself , I just do
1	I feel like I ’ve lost most of my energy for the past … I do n’t know how many months , really
1	It ’s getting harder and harder for me to get out of bed in the morning , and to keep my eyes open in class
1	I feel like my concentration is getting worse and worse and I just hate it
1	No matter how early I go to bed , I ’ll always be tired the next day
1	The only time I feel truly awake is when I ’m out for a walk , listening to music or not
1	And I do n’t know if it ’s because I ’m tired , but I ’ve become A LOT more irritable than I used to be
1	I have no control over it , and I really hate it
1	For instance there ’s my dad , who I love of course , but every little thing he does or says really puts my teeth on edge
1	Sometimes I think he ’s too sentimental , then I think he ’s too judgmental , too loud , too embarrassing , too close , too whiney , too demanding and so on and so forth
1	And there really is nothing I can do about it , even though I try
1	I keep remembering past mistakes , thinking about all of the things I could have done better
1	And lately I feel like I ’m the worst friend in the world
1	My best friend is always here for me , even though I have n’t really told her how sad I truly feel all of the time
1	But well , I do n’t think I ’m there enough for her
1	I ’m always thinking about my own problems , but some weeks ago I realized that I think she might be feeling down too
1	Like me , she ’s often tired and she often complains in subtle ways about things going on at home her parents are divorced or about other things going on in her life
1	I ’m just starting to think that she ’s feeling a lot worse than she lets on
1	And I feel awful for not noticing earlier and for not knowing how to help her
1	Because unlike me , she has real reasons for being sad , and she deserves a friend who can help her much more than I can
1	I just feel like I ’m letting her down , but I do n’t know what to do about it
1	I do n’t know how I can help her with all of these thoughts running through my own head
1	I talk to people in school , and it ’s not like I sit by myself all day , but after school I just never feel like being with friends – I just feel like going home
1	When people text me , I honestly wish they did n’t , because I do n’t feel like texting back
1	My oldest sister , who is 18 , also has actual problems and real reasons for being sad
1	I love my sister so much , and she ’s probably the person I look most up to in the entire world
1	Often my family says I ’m like a mini copy of her , which I guess I am
1	She loves heavy metal music , she ’s the one who introduced me to it , and now I love heavy metal music
1	She ’s a gigantic bookworm who also loves writing her own fantasy stories – well , me too
1	But my sister has had a lot of social problems – she has n’t had many friends , but I think it ’s gotten better lately
1	She has Tourette ’s syndrome , not the kind where she sprouts out random words and noises , but she ’s constantly twitching and ticking and I know she hates it
1	Also , she has had a lot of trouble in school , especially in math , and as I ’ve said earlier , she has n’t had many friends
1	So , you see , my sister has real reasons for having a hard time , and I do know that she ’s had a depression , but I do n’t know if she still does – she seems pretty happy lately
1	But what I hate , is that I really am a copy of my sister , and I feel like I ’ve stolen her life in some way that I ’m not a real person , just a shadow of my sister
1	This is who I really want to be , who I really am , so why does my family always have to say I ’m like a copy of my sister when I ’m really just being me
1	Why ca n’t I just be me
1	She ’s a wonderful person and I do n’t get why she has so few friends
1	I have n’t ever really cut myself … Well , I once cut words into my thighs FAKE and HELP with a safety pin , but I do n’t feel like that ’s actual cutting , because , well , I used a safety pin and it did n’t even draw that much blood Am I really depressed
1	WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME ” I often get these small breakdowns alone in my room , and in the end I always feel empty , numb , tired and pathetic
1	Because I do n’t think I ’m depressed
1	I ’m just trying to be , but I do n’t know why
1	I do n’t know why I wo n’t just let myself be happy
1	I know I should probably tell somebody about all of this , but I just do n’t know how to explain it them
1	So my question is is there really something wrong with me
1	I mean , am I really depressed or do I on some subconscious level just want attention
1	Please , if you have any advice that could help me out of this dark tunnel , I would appreciate it so , so much
1	So yesterday while in the shower I asked my husband if there was anything he can do for his snoring
1	He snores extremely loud and I am 75 months pregnant and now with my frequent potty breaks at night I ve noticed it more
1	Omg I wish i did nt ask him that he justs started screaming and cursing
1	I mean he gets like this once in a while but not since i have been pregnant
1	I ve been married for five years
1	I get extremely scared of him when he is like this cause he starts punching things like first in the begginning it was the shower curtain rod he broke off and bended it into pieces , then the mirror in the bathroom he smashed , then the hole in the wall he puched and he has thrown things too
1	And now yesterday night a even bigger hole in another wall that he decided to punch
1	He even tore my pillow i had since i was a year old
1	Of course I cry and that makes him angrier
1	He goes on like this for a while and he always blames me for getting him like this
1	I hate him when he is like this
1	I try and stay quiet while this happens cause it only seems to make him worst when i speak
1	But now I have reached a point where I am extremely scared and do nt know what to do cause I do nt want to have my baby be around this
1	I have asked him to seek help but the empty promises has gotten old and so is the i 'm sorry
1	On Saturday 26th my bf and I were cuddling and I sat on his lap straddled him both of us had clothes on yoga pants and panties for me and sweat pants and cotton boxers for him and then i noticed that he had gotten an erection , after a few minutes I moved away from it and eventually got off of his lap no stroking , no thrusting involved his pants did n't seem wet but the inside of my panties were damp i m guessing perspiration or arousal   later i have had what l assumed was painful ovulation bloating , pains , cramps , fatigue , etc following that there was a slight brownness in my cervical mucusTMI sorrry is there a chance that I could be pregnant
1	I currently have occasional sharp pains in both ovaries , I 'm bloated and should be due for my period on the 8th PS also note that I believe I ovulated on Sunday the 27the day after the lap incident my nipples are n't sore , they are n't darker , I am not having morning sicknessits just not normal for me to have painful ovulation or intense ovarian pangs without a period what 's wrong with me
1	I do n't think I 'm pregnant
1	WE DIDN'T HAVE SEX , PMS , cysts
1	I am a 27 year old female , in a loving relationship with one child
1	For years now I have been emotionally abused by mother and it has only been recently that I am coming to terms with this
1	I have suffered and suffer from GAD this is down to my childhood , through abuse with my mother , domestic violence and sexual abuse by my grandfather , my mothers father , who also abused my mother
1	I would like to know why my mother does not bother much with my son , there is no bond there at all , and she questions my mothering skills on a regular basis
1	My son idolises his Grandma , which makes me feel very very hurt , but also at the same time I feel ashamed and embarrassed because of this , and think why she could do this to an innocent young child
1	I have tried for many years now to build a normal relationship with my family for the sake of my son following all of the trauma that has happened I always seem to seek reassurance from my mother but I have come to terms with the fact that I will never get this from her , but I do not want my son to experience the same treatment as what I have done over the years
1	I live very close to my mother , so I find it hard to keep her at arms length from my son , and wonder what is the best thing all round for a happy healthy future and childhood for my son
1	I look forward to hearing from you
1	About 16 months ago my husband   I separated he walked out on me while I was pregnant with our son
1	We reconciled , split   reconciled again for what we thought was the last time about 6 months ago
1	My oldest child had been taken May 2011 due to bs reports made by my own mother claiming I was abusing her   at that time I was left with my then disabled 2 yr old daughter   my son who was 7 weeks old
1	During all this I was in   out of contact with the father of my children
1	During the battle to get her back we got back together   fought it together
1	In August my daughter was returned to me   she has been with us since
1	We relocated   of course the cause my abusive mother has n't let up
1	In Dec 2011 she lost her right to access to my children   within days she contacted police claiming I had assaulted my oldest child even though she lives across town   had NO proof
1	She has since gotten involved trying to help our landlord evict us   her grandchildren , whom she claims she loves , yet you can clearly see not
1	My middle child does n't even call her her grandma   the kids are all scared of her
1	Despite all this my husband   I have stayed together   worked at our relationship
1	The last few months we have been talking about TTC another child so l was so excited for 3 Saturdays ago to come because I was late   having other pregnancy symptoms
1	I did a HPT   it came back negative
1	I completely broke down   spent hours crying
1	I spent awhile talking with my husband later in the day   we agreed we would keep trying but the second he touched me I started crying again   had the hardest time allowing it
1	Yes we already have children together   each have a child from a previous relationship , but we both feel this incredible need for another child
1	We see how quickly our other children are growing   I know that IF my previous problems start again I may not get a chance later so would like to have another now
1	With everything my children   I have been through why ca n't 1 thing happen easily for us
1	The last 2 years have been the most difficult years I have ever had to live through   this year is not looking any better
1	I am such a strong advocate for families affected by CPSCAS   fight so hard for my children , but my depression is hitting so hard lately with the issues   seeing what my mother is trying to do   I am sure the stress is n't helping any with TTC or my relationship with my husband
1	I have suffered from depression for as long as I can remember , have PTSD as well as anxiety   panic attacks
1	I have a physical disability as well involving my spine   SEVERE chronic pain DAILY
1	Some days the pain is so severe that I ca n't get out of bed   I have caught myself wishing for death to relieve me
1	If it was n't for my children I highly doubt I 'd still be among the living
1	My husband knows all this   when I suddenly get into a depressive state or start crying he 'll sit there with an attitude asking what 's wrong now
1	RARELY does he try to do anything to help   can actually make things MUCH worse by his ignorance   unwillingness to help
1	I do n't understand why Karma is so intent on punishing me
1	I feel so incredibly alone , even though I have my husband   children here
1	I do n't have any of my other family because I chose to marry my husband   they have either tried to destroy my little family or they refuse to get past that I am with him
1	Even when we were separated they never bothered with me
1	Add on our ignorant neighbor shooting her mouth off   working with my mother they have destroyed 3 businesses I was involved in due to the rumors they started   ended up losing many friends thanks to it as well
1	Last night my husband was logged onto facebook on my laptop   did n't log off before handing it back to me
1	I clicked on messages thinking I had logged into mine , but instead found myself in his inbox
1	I came across SEVERAL questionable messages between him , a bunch of women   a few of his guy friends
1	He had been telling his male friend how miserable he is here   how he met a woman who he 'd do   told him how hot this woman is
1	He went on in other messages telling woman how hot they are or how amazing they look
1	We have been through this before once when I found messages in my computer from MSN messenger of him telling guy friends that he cheats on me
1	I do n't know if he has in fact cheated , but the messages he has been sending to women are inappropriate   he does n't see anything wrong with it
1	He said I do n't ask to see your messages so I logged in   said here go for it
1	Do you think I 'm over reacting
1	There has ALWAYS been trust issues due to his lies which there have been some VERY big ones , but for the kids I have tried to move on
1	I ca n't keep shrugging them off like they are nothing ,   I do n't want my kids aged from 9 yrs to 10 months to think that lying is ok HELP please
1	My depression even with meds is n't letting up ,   I feel COMPLETELY alone
1	I did n't know if this belonged in the depresssion or not but I had to post it here because I am 16 and I had just got out of 4 months of depression because I found out that this guy I was talking to who was like 20 had a girlfriend and was about to use me for sex
1	As a teen I think I have always worried so much and thought so hard that it actually makes me sick , of course I can only blame this on myself but that s why I came here to get some online help until I see a counselor
1	I guess I 'm basically saying that relationships are making me sad because I feel I will never find what I consider a boyfriend because when everytime I start dating a guy I find out sooner or laterand I know they are n't bad people but they are either about to break up with their girlfriends or are still with them
1	Ok so anyways , I met this guy who I did n't necessarily like as a boyfriend but as a friend and it turned out that he likes me more than a friend , I use to play with him at work which was pretending to me that I liked him but to him he really liked me
1	So obviously he got mad when I told him I liked him as a friend but gradually I decided that he would be great to go out with
1	He gave me his number and I started asking him questions
1	My 1st question was Have you ever made out before
1	and he texted me back on my cell Of course and he told me he had 3 ex girlfriends in his whole life
1	I told him I never necessarily had a boyfriend but I did n't tell him why
1	So I do n't know all of a sudden I became jealous of himI'm not sure what you call it it was a mixture of sadness , pain , and anger , like the thought of him having a good relationship made me angry because I was like comparing myself
1	Like I do n't feel good enough for him , not necessarily of his exgirlfriends but I think I 'm jealous of the fact that he considers them his girlfriends and he has made out before
1	And sometimes I do imagine what they look like
1	I do n't even know nor have I seen his exes but I do n't get why I am so jealous of the fact that he has made out before
1	Then it disturbed that I was jealous of the fact that he even kissed a girl , and I did n't like him to begin with
1	I tried to tell myself that I ca n't control that fact and I tell myself I too have kissed a boy but to me making out is like kissing for a long time and I feel I have n't made out so I guess I feel a little insecure and that I feel I have to know how to do these things since he did itI assume with his other girlfriends , really I do n't know I 've never felt this way before and he did n't even know me then , also I am sad because he goes to a different high school form me and his ex does go there
1	The thought of not having a good boyfriend makes me feel inferior and that I am not good enough or that I am a wierdo , a freak , a loser , that I have no life because I have n't made out I guess , but really making out can be different things
1	I just do n't feel important and I already have a lower self esteem form my so called boyfriends
1	I have been in high school and my friends talk about their boyfriends but never have I felt this bad about it
1	I 'm just looking for something that will make me happy and I see girls smile when they talk about their boyfriends taking them out and I just see the world as everyone has something I do n't have not what I have
1	Ok more on the different high school , it saddens me that I 'm not going to see him over the school year and probably never again because even though I have his number he has n't been texting me and he is going to graduate this year
1	I do n't know what to do and sometimes I think he will go back to his ex girlfriend or she might want him again because I asked about his ex gf and he told me that she loves him but I do n't think he loves her
1	I just need some help sorting my feelings out because I feel like jello almost
1	Every few months though , I feel sudden uncontrollable bursts of rage that persist for hours before finally subsiding
1	People who I liked I suddenly find myself lashing out at without regards for what it will do to relationships
1	I ca n't help but feel like I 'm sabotaging my own life , and that alone is cause for concern
1	The outbursts have been going on sporadically since I was about eight , so nine years now
1	I was never abused as a child , and I 've led a fairly normal life except for my outbursts , which everybody who knows me closely has had first hand experience with
1	I 'm 15 and a female
1	And I 'll hear it and it 'll startle me and most of the time I jump
1	I 've had hallucinations , but when these have all happened I 've been in bed and been woken up and I 'm sure they are not dreams
1	Once I woke up by the sound of my door opening slightly and seeing half a dark body like peeping around , with long black hair
1	I shock it and got scared so I threw it across the room and heard a thud on the wall but I did n't want it in my room so I turned on the light and looked everywhere to find it but never did
1	I feel I am watched and have problems changing places even in my room because the posters on my wall can see and my mirrors have cameras in so I do n't change in front of them , same with a few of my stuffed toys on my bed , so I change facing a way that seems okay to me
1	I always look over my shoulder when I 'm out and I do n't trust anyone with secrets just in case anything could happen
1	Some times I think something would be in my room with me , and I think I see something so I have to turn on the light and always do when I 'm going to sleep before I sleep I must have turned on my light about twenty times because I get so scared
1	I can be quite violent or in my mind anyway , I always imagine something bad happening to me , for example if I 'm walking in the street and a man walks past me I might picture him just throwing me in front of a car , or raping me
1	I can imagine myself doing horrible things to other people , if they 've annoyed me or said something , I generally think about it over and over again and what my reaction would be
1	I was exspelled from school for a day , after I hit a girl
1	She hit my friend , so I hit her , it was only a slap
1	But I always wish I did worse
1	I always imagine chasing her and pushing her to the ground and screaming in her face
1	I often speak out loud what I 'm thinking
1	And I 'm always talking to myself in my head
1	Whether I 'm talking to someone I do n't know
1	I often think I am because of them way I 'm speaking
1	I day dream terribly and it 's hard to shake me out of it , people around me often shake , tap and repeatedly saying my name quite a few time until I 'm there
1	I think of all types of things , violent things like I have already explained , things like ' if I could ' if I were magic or do what ever I could like fly
1	Art I am very good at , I have a good eye for things and everything needs to be perfect , and perfectly placed and looking good or it 'll irritate me very badly
1	I have n't properly cut since about two months maybe
1	But I have burnt myself using the ends of match sticks , I light them , let them burn for a bit and blow them out and then press them on my skin
1	When I 'm very irritated I pinch myself , I have pulled out my hair before but that 's not much of a problem
1	Eating can be a problem I sometimes wo n't eat because I think I do n't deserve it , or I 'm fat enough
1	If I feel I 've over eaten or having a bad week I would make myself sick
1	I do eat my scabs , skin , ear wax , boogers , eye crust , nails , spots , dead skin from chewing my fingers or lips
1	I do n't know what this is or if there is a term , I 'm worried if it makes me at any health risks
1	I constantly want to please people , so sometimes I act different around people I do n't know at all , like walking around in town , friends sometimes I spend stupid amounts of money of them
1	Just generally so stuff I regret afterwards because I was trying to please them
1	I 'm sorry this has been a very long post , but thank you very much for taking your time to reading it and I hope you can help me
1	I have a soon to be 19 year old son that has gotten way out of control with how he treats me
1	March 29 , 2009 he watched a friend die   there was four boys swimming in a pond in March here in NC   water was FREEZING   they all got hyperthermia and one drowned
1	Even though the final autopsy showed the boys heart had stopped and no matter if he had been gotten to or not , he would have died
1	Then a year later a very close friend of his that practically lived here died of an asthma attack
1	He was one of the four that was swimming the day the first boy drowned
1	He smokes pot , and refuses to see he needs to stop
1	He drinks and he and his girlfriend who lives here with us , she has no family at all , and lost everything   so i let stay here   another story for another day
1	I have made them leave 3 times   his dad lets them come back
1	The last time they were living in his truck and it he asked for help saying he would do anything it took to make it right
1	I let him back   HUGE
1	The last couple of years , he has escalated with abuse   about 6 months ago , the mean name callings F'n Bch
1	I am a lazy , bad mom   Cusses at me , puts me down , and as of last night threatened me
1	I have loved him , been there no matter what   gave him everything
1	Worked hard to make a good life for him and his brother
1	I have another son he will be 14 in March   he is the exact opposite of my older son
1	He is respectful and get really mad when his brother treats me the way he does
1	This is where my oldest has learned alot of what he does to me
1	My husband says things and my oldest thinks he also has the right to talk to me like his father
1	When I get onto my oldest being lazy   or what ever it may be it starts an arguement and my husband tells ME to shut up and quit starting things
1	And I am running my mouth again   ect
1	So   my son sees this as my husband validating him and not me
1	I stay in my room most times because it is easier
1	It is NOT fair   why do they get to run the house while I have to be a prisoner in my own home
1	If i try to talk to my husband   it starts another argument
1	He gets defensive about his son
1	He blames me for everything   what a bad mom i am , what a bad person i am
1	He refuses to hug me , kiss me , sex has not happened in 5 years   No companionship at all , nothing
1	Even with all that I have sacrificed   all that I have done to help him with the cancer and transplant
1	It is not fair to my youngest   he is in the middle of all this
1	My husband had liver cancer   the last 5 years I have stuck right by him and taken care of him
1	He had a transplant last March and is doing really good now
1	It was me and my youngest that was there   my oldest no where to be found
1	I told him to be out by friday 01172014   and never come back
1	He is in the process , but not before he cussed me and told me what a terrible mother I am , etc
1	He was telling me what he was taking and I could not do anything about it
1	Then to proceed to tell me he would beat my   if i tried to stop him
1	His dad might be frail , but I am not
1	I NEVER ever thought he would be like this   NEVER
1	I am not sure if he would try
1	I am sure in the near future   he is going to try it , the way he is escalating
1	Let him and his father have it and battle it all out
1	I think when it was with just one , it was easier to ignore or deal with because i knew there would be a time I could get away when the boys were older
1	I have no where to go or no one to help me
1	I always feel so alone in the world like I watch everyone else be a apart of it , and I stick out like a sore thumb
1	I cry to myself sometimes and whisper to myself , it 's okay you have yourself , because I feel so alone
1	I hate my friends and family sometimes because of small things that seem big to me at that time , like if they were hanging out with someone else when I wanted to hang out with them , I 'd feel jealous and angry with them for it or for no reason and do n't want to be friends with them anymore
1	Other times I love them so much , want to hang out with them all the time , want them to need me , want to have their company
1	It 's really frustrating because sometimes I can feel like I 'm being two faced but I ca n't help but hate them and then love them from one day to the next
1	I feel like nobody really cares even if they say they do
1	I can get times where I feel happy , excited and euphoric for no reason and then feel so low and depressed and worthless the next
1	I ca n't explain how different I feel
1	I feel so different sometimes I think maybe I might not be human
1	I have also had what I can only describe as ' mixed episode ' Bipolar Energetic , happy , depressed , suicidal , racing thoughts and anger all at the same time
1	I know there are cases where people have BP and BPD so I 'm not sure
1	I think I may have anxiety as well
1	I have n't gone to school in 2 weeks , 4 weeks if you include the holidays
1	I get panic attacks and I hate crowds
1	I am constantly tense , sweating , my mouth is always dry and my heart is always beating fast
1	I 'm so worried and paranoid about being judged , I know people judge me but sometimes I feel it very intensely
1	I hate meeting new people because I am so scared they will judge me , laugh at me or thing I 'm strange
1	I went through a bad phase with this were I heard kids screaming , gunshot , doorbells and we do n't have a doorbell , seeing things , hearing people calling my name 247 , hearing noises , whispers
1	I only hear sounds , noises , people calling me sometimes and feel as though there 's something trying to get me
1	I feel like there 's something lingering near me sometimes but I know there is n't
1	I SH but have n't in about a month because I saw a psychiatrist briefly and she told my parents those things , because I 'm only 16 , I am considered a minor in Ireland
1	I hate all these things so much , I 'm too scared to go certain places where there is people I do n't know or am not close with , in fear of being judged and looked at or getting a panic attack and not being able to leave the situation
1	I ca n't do things because I have no motivation and just want to stay in bed and be away from the world but at the same time I do n't want to be alone , I want to have company , feel loved and wanted , be sociable and have a life
1	I heard of something called a quiet Borderline , I feel like if I did have BPD , I would definitely be a quiet Borderline
1	I get so angry and agitated , I do act out when angry sometimes but not badly
1	However when I 'm alone I scream , shout , I go red , my vein starts to popout on my forehead and I get a headache and feel so exhausted
1	I feel like a time bomb and if I did n't have panic attacks and was n't so anxious
1	I also do n't often disagree with people because I do n't want them to get angry at me or stop being friends with me
1	I ca n't take criticism well , because I can be so sensitive
1	Any little thing can cause me so much stress and make me really depressed
1	I 've never been good friends with anyone for longer than 12 years except one friend which I am so grateful for
1	But I find myself waiting for her to leave , or for us to stop being friends cause it 's so weird being friends with someone for 5 years
1	I mean 5 whole years , yes fights but still 5 years , that 's along time for me
1	Anyway , I would really appreciate an opinion on what you think

1	Some of you have read my past journals about my relationship issues , including what transpired last summer with my then 14 yo and her stepfather
1	I found out tonight that he has started his sexual harrassment towards here again
1	Apparently it 's been going on for a few months , but she was scared to tell me
1	When she finally opened up to me tonight I assured her that I am trying my very best to find a job and get us out of here
1	I also told her that if she feels it 's to the point where she is so uncomfortable that she wants to get out NOW , all she has to do is tell me
1	I 'll pack my kids up while he 's at work and take them to the Women 's shelter if I have to
1	I am now more determined than ever to get my kids out of here
1	I am sick to my stomach and ca n't decide if I want to throw up or beat the sht out of him or both
1	Thus far , according to her it 's just been sexually based comments about her clothes or her body , uncomfortable touching , like the other day he was hugging her from a sitting position and rested his head on her chest
1	I 'm trying really hard not to over react so I can stay levelheaded
1	I 'm debating on calling the social worker from the case last summer and seeing if she can have him removed from the house , then having the legal advisor of the women 's shelter help me get a restraining order
1	I can then apply for TANF which means he will be forced to pay support if he 's not arrested , which is unlikely since there is no proof
1	With TANF I will be more apt to get child care assistance so I CAN work when I do get a job offer
1	If I go this route it 's going to be very rough and I 'm going to have to keep a LOT of faith that God will provide for us
1	If anyone has ANY advice or suggestions on how I should handle this or other avenues I can take , places I can go to for assistances , whatever , PLEASE PLEASE let me know
1	I have to be delicate about this because there ARE guns in our house and God only knows what kind of psycho sht he might pull if I set him off
1	Depending on the route I choose , I may call my brother and see if he can be here when it all goes downand I will make sure the guns are hidden or removed FIRST
1	We 've been enduring verbalemotional abuse for years
1	This sexual abuse against my daughter started up about the time she was 13 12
1	He turns EVERYTHING around to be everyone else fault except his
1	The only time he admits fault is when he feels it 's necessary to restore the neat little order of him control things
1	I 've been married for 21yrs
1	My husband did n't show me that he had anger issues until we were married for about 6 months
1	It began at first with putting Visine eye drops in my eyes where he got so upset with me that he threw the medicine at the closet door
1	Later we began yelling at me for various things , even being physical with me
1	I was raised with abuse and could not recognize my husband 's abuse
1	I always thought I was the problem and he was right
1	Now , at 40yrs old I do n't believe in his views
1	I am tired of his anger towards our children
1	When he gets angry , he gets so loud , so degrading and he physically bullies them acting like he is going to do something to them
1	He just acts like he knows and he immediately punishes them
1	With me , he is not as harsh yet that does n't mean he is better
1	If I say no to sex , he will insult me
1	He frequently yells at me in front of the children
1	He expects his rules to be done to the letter of the law at times , and when I fail , I get yelled at
1	He snoops in my van for wrappers to foods that I bought so that he can make a mess in my van showing me that he knows that I ate something wrong
1	He checks my internet usage for the amount of time I spend on it at night when he is at work
1	He hates all my friends and does n't like me going out much
1	He rarely praises anyone in his family
1	Recently I stood up to him and told him that I wo n't take this anymore
1	I tried to explain how I see his actions but he wo n't allow me to finish my thoughts without interrupting me , yelling at me and trying to single out small points to make it my fault
1	He does n't want to hear his faults at all and I told him that I wo n't continue to talk to him unless he listens to me
1	He is now punishing me by not sleeping with me and refusing to talk to me
1	I was diagnosed with BPD almost a year ago and within a month of my diagnosis my psychiatrist bailed on me
1	She left me high and dry which sent me into a depressed and suicidal spiral
1	He worked with me for one session and when my family doctorFD discussed with him my previous diagnosis that was it I never had another session and so I was left in the hospital on lock down
1	3 weeks later I left the hospital at my FD request
1	Over the next few months she controlled my meds and set me up with her in practice Social Worker
1	We met weekly and she again confirmed my diagnosis of BPD after about the third week
1	In our next session she was distant and cold and very unfriendly so that was my last session
1	I returned to my family doctor and and she continued to monitor my meds while trying to get me a new psychiatrist
1	And then in the summer my family doctor left the practice and I was placed with a new doctor
1	She does n't even know what BPD is and she stopped all my meds except my depression meds
1	So I went out on my own trying to find a psychiatrist but I ca n't afford anyone as I have no insurance
1	Then this fall we lost our mental health unit for the county all together
1	I have no professional support and I have been spiraling out of control with the complete feeling of total abandonment
1	This is a favourite quotation of mine from many , many , many years ago , which may help you through stress
1	Speak your truth quietly and clearly and listen to others , even to the dull and the ignorant they too have their story
1	If you compare yourself with others , you may become vain or bitter , for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself
1	Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans
1	You ar a child of the universe , no less than the trees and the stars you have a right to be here
1	Therefore be at peace with God , whatever you conceive Him to be
1	And whatever your labors and aspirations , in the noisy confusion of life , keep peace in your soul
1	Hi all , I am new here , I have a question that will need some back ground
1	I have a brother who was diagnosed with BPD , he is either licking your boots or spitting venom at you
1	He has never had a relation ship with any one and can only report , he will call me twice a week and tell me what scores he got on his test at college
1	He is now in this relationship with a woman who is recently divorced and has two children , She is devout Baptist , and keeps trying to convert him , We went to visit our other brother last month in SC and our sister in law said fuk in the car on the way to dinner , he yelled if you ever say anything like that in front of Donna I will kick your   back to SC This is how he treats people on every level of talking to them
1	My question is how to deal with him , he called me to report and started to go on about how donnas father was coming for dinner and because he is going to vote for obama , and her father is not , she told him not to talk about the issue
1	ca n't he have a discussion with someone on a topic he does not agree with
1	He went off , and so did I unloading several years of looking the other way on him
1	Ok so me and my bf have known each other for about 6 years , we dated in high school but did n't work out but kept in touch
1	His parents are separated and his last gf was abusive towards him by throwing thing and hitting
1	Well in October 2013 we started dating again and everything was great I had just gotten out of a bad relationship as did he so we were happy to have each other
1	Long story short , we had our ups and downs during the first year since our exes would not get out of the picture , and something that strained our relationship was his ex girlfriend sending me an old tape of them having sex and her hacking into his phone and texting me she works for a telemarketer   but between all of this my trust has been compromised because I feel like he is hiding something , I mean there is a reason she keeps stirring up drama
1	She 's done it three times the last being December
1	Going into our 3rd year , 2nd in a relationship I noticed around last year in November thing seemed to change
1	Yes we had our occasional fights but they started to become more regular
1	Also he had this thing with calling me a , stupid or you 're acting like a   I did n't like it and eventually he stopped but going into this year we 've been arguing every other week
1	And one night in January we got into a big argument and he backed me into the couch and put his hand around my neck , enough for me to forced my hand through to break the grip
1	He was so angry he did n't even realize he did it until I told him and then he got mad at me for sayid it because he did n't believe me
1	This anger kept evolving and he would punch walls and the steering wheel just something when he was mad
1	He also began to get really controlling in my eyes and still is
1	If I mentioned to him that I felt like he was he would get angry and we would have an argument
1	I ca n't have guy friends , ca n't go out to a bar or club or even dinnerI'm in college he hates most of my friends and does n't want me talking to them or hanging around them he wants to know everywhere I go and if I do n't tell him my plans or if I decide to do something within plans he know he is upset
1	He got upset at me one day because I got lunch with a friendguy after my clinicals all day
1	When I was honest and told him of my day he got mad and gave me the silent treatment for a day
1	I had to apologize constantly and I 've been saying I 'm sorry more than he has in a month
1	About a month ago we got in another big fight
1	My grandmother was sick while I was on spring break and he was also dealing with problems
1	We had some miscommunications and he thought I did n't care and blah blah blah , he came over the next night and we were watching a movie well he brought up the situation and tried to leave and I tried to stop him by blocking the door because he ignored and cuts me off everything I 'm talking
1	Well I grabbed my wrist and yanked me forward , as I came forward I do n't know what happened
1	I told him to get away from me and he was apologetic and saying it was him to that that I 'm sorry etc afterwards he had a panic attack and I found my self caring for him
1	Afterwards we had makeup sex and he never talked about it again
1	Lately the signs are getting stronger and he never listens to me but always finds something wrong with me to pick on and I feel like I 'm walking on eggshells and he notices because I 'm scared to say what I feel since he is so sensitive and easily angered
1	But when I get angry I have no reason and he gets away with to much
1	I 've been searching signs and they 're there I just ca n't believe that it 's happening
1	I really just need to vent and get advice , I need someone to talk to
1	my parents have been divorced since i was in grd 3 now i m in grd 9 , i am fine with the divorcei understand it
1	he acts like a good guy around my mom but is awful to me when my mom is not around
1	he yells and sometimes he beats memy sister has been doing everything she can to get me in trouble
1	my mom is incredibly mean to me when her soon to be husband is around
1	my dad is a good guy but he does not understand any of this so i m scared to talk to himi am shy and i only have one friend
1	when something happens to her i am always there to support and help her but when i need help she ignores me and starts to talk about the latest gift that she got
1	i try to make more friends but it is so hard for me to open up or talk to someone unless i 've known them for years already
1	i tryec to talk to my mom but she only got mad at me and sent me to my dads house
1	please help me , i do nt know what to do
1	i feel so lost and my thoughts are everywhere my mind wo nt stop racing
1	i 've barely been able to eat i feel so sick , it feels like a lot of effort for me to get up to even make something to eat
1	I 'm getting terrible anxiety , my wrists get cold , my stomach starts hurting , my negative thoughts wo nt stop
1	I think about suicide 247 and i do nt want to think about it , is that normal
1	I try to tell some people who i m close to how i feel , but they just blow it off like no big deal , everyone just says   your fine   or   do n't worry about it it will go away your tough , that really pisses me off and makes it worse and makes me angry that no one is listening to my cry for help
1	I m up all night crying every nightI ca n't function I ca n't concentrate
1	I feel like I ca n't feel anything but pain
1	It hurts so bad and I need someone , I feel like I do n't have anybody , and I feel like you do n't want me home
1	I do n't know what to do anymoreWhat do I do
1	Do I have to fight this a lone , because if I do I ca n't make it
1	My mom brushes it off , so does my grandma and anyone else I try to give little signs too
1	I know that I need help
1	I barely even know what I 'm doing , my thinking is all messed up , my attitude and anger is n't me , I do n't feel like me , I worry all the time my anxiety is getting worse

1	i need to get my life back to track
1	want to spend time with kidsi get mad at almost everyone without a reasoni need some advise on wat to domakes me upset not being able to love my kids like i wanted to
1	A Asian girl has a terrible social communication and outlook on the world because her parents are acrid and ignorant because she is a girl they wanted a son , and they have to struggle to make ends meet
1	Because of this , she might not like socializing with others , have a very biased perspective , and severely punish herself for not meeting her parents expectations
1	SENARIO TWO Sorry I really want you to understand what I 'm talking about 2
1	Because of this accident , he can no longer play his favorite sport which he was about to get a scholarship in and now is going though a lot of suffering in order to adjust to this life
1	The reason they 're are scenarios like this is because if someone had a different mentality , they would have coped with these situations differently
1	I 'm mainly interested in with what not the obvious and why it 's done like you see a family in which everyone is fat and stupid yet they miraculously have a son or daughter who is sweet , slim , and serine
1	Alittle back ground info on my relationship , it started out pretty great on 3911 almost a year ago , he treated me amazing , like a princess he made me feel like nobody else mattered but me
1	But I had all these girls message me on Facebook telling me to watch myself and that he was a Cheater and that he was trying to talk to them and stuff , well I blew it all off for awhile then it kinda started to click when different girls were all saying sort of the same stuff , so I asked him about it he got upset and said no they are all just jealous because they wanted him
1	So I sucked it up and for once in my life trusted him , not that I did n't trust him , but because of family and past relationships I have really bad trust issues
1	But i really trusted him well after a couple months of being together he got kicked out of his moms house , and I do n't know why , but I left with him
1	I left my house my nice clothes myeverything to be with him
1	I know you all will say that was a bad idea , cause now I do know that so pleas do nt comment on that
1	I started to realize a lot and I found out he really did cheat on me and the three months we stayed at that house he tried his best to hook up with girls and talk and invite them over thing is , then he was n't working I was atleast 40 hours a week
1	Then we moved back to his moms , but in the apartment below her but only for a month and things seemed to get better , although I became pregnant , but i had an abortion because my mom was pushing it on me and he kind of made me feel like I trapped him , I stopped taking my birth control although he knew I was nt well once we moved out of his moms we moved into his half brothers very very trashy house
1	I mean roaches bugs forty very bad house
1	I cried the hole week before and the hole first week because that 's where we were gon na live
1	We fought all the time and his brother was a complete Assholeee to me because he said I was a
1	Then we got kicked out because they stole my cat while I was at work and took it to The spca
1	And we went and stayed at hotels for a month until we got our own apartment , once we got out of his brothers house everything got real good
1	I am now again pregnant , 27 weeks at the moment and he just seems so not interested , like everything else matters
1	He will treat me ok when he feels like it , but I can just see that he does n't give a crap anymore , then other day we got into a fight and he tried calling his dad in sc , we are from pa To move down there
1	Then lie to me about it after I already knew
1	He says he wants to be with me BUT he acts just the opposite
1	And I 'm at my wits end , I already feel like I 'm going to be a single mother
1	But idk I just do n't know what to do anymore , I feel like I made a lot of mistakes by giving him the second chances by getting pregnant again even though I love my daughter to death already
1	I feel like I should n't have gotten this apartment
1	I know it will be so hard without him
1	I do nt know what to do or how to confront him about it
1	If I say I feel this way he will be like oh you do n't love me and just go from there
1	But I do love him
1	I just do n't love what he 's doing to me
1	My husband who has been recently diagnosed is telling me he is going to commit suicide
1	He is currently living with his sister as I am looking after our 2 teenage boys
1	He is not coping with the seperation so has informed me that unless me and the boys keep in contact with him , he will commit suicuide
1	Through pressure from him , I let him meet with the boys and told them to be open and honest with them
1	They told him they did n't want him to ring them and they will ring him when they are ready which might be a while
1	He pulled me aside before we left and said you know the rate of suicide for this disorder , so are you prepared that this will happen
1	I felt enormous guilt taking the boys to see him and asking them to be honest with him
1	I 'm scared if he does harm himself , the boys will carry the guilt of having said to him that they do n't want to see him
1	We are under professional help , but he keeps changing therapists because he does n't like them confronting the issues
1	I want to provide as much detail as I can to get the most help
1	I decided to take in my distant cousin who I had no idea been living on the streets for over two yearsHis abusive father who had Schizophrenia committed suicide several years ago and his equally abusive mother moved to another state , leaving him to fend for himself when he was barely a teenHe then told me he himself had Schizophrenia
1	He lived on Social Security where his aunt became the payee but used his money for her own use
1	He had been beaten up several times and suffered even more types of abuse while living in a room and board until he ran away
1	I decided since I had an extra room in my house , he could live with me for a while
1	Maybe that was a mistake With his new surroundings , he was very happy that at age 26 , he finally had his own room , a tv
1	I provided him with all necessities and even food until his SS check came , but about a week into him staying with me , he began eating my roommates ' food and stuff that I had planned to make for my fiance on our anniversary
1	He came up with excuses that he had n't eaten well and was n't used to it but he would pay us back
1	I told him just because he says he will pay us back does n't mean he has free will to eat what he wants
1	I told him which food was his and not to touch anything elseI've now had to tell him several times but he is n't retaining it and he 's making my roommates uncomfortable when he sneaks up on them while they are cooking and asks them for food
1	They have also thrown food away when it was obvious he had picked at it , dipped his spoon in the ice cream or dug his finger in the peanut butter
1	He says he has learned to sometimes ignore the voices or he writes songs to the voices , telling them they wo n't run his life or he will giggle while he 's walking down the street , making conversation with them
1	I ca n't take him to the store or the mall because he will start skipping through the aisles , talking to strangers , scaring them or flirting with girls while their boyfriends are standing right next to them , rattling off philosophical quotes he says he learned while staying in Buddhist temples and mosques for shelter
1	He does a high pitched screech randomly , he talks in a childlike tone and moves his body in a very strange way
1	I wondered if he also had some sort of mental retardationI do n't take him to stores anymore
1	I did , however take him to a local mental health clinic
1	He was given Diphenhydramine , Zoloft , Deprol , Divalproex and Abilify
1	They said he was bipolar along with schizophrenic but I know there is something else going on with him and they did n't pick up
1	I made sure he swallowed each pill on schedule since he said he was n't taking any of his other meds
1	He says they make him even hungrier
1	His behavior has gotten worse since he 's been here for some months
1	I feel like I am constantly reminding him how to do things and what not to do
1	He does not clean up after himself , ca n't do his own laundry even though I taught him how several times but he forgets and broke off a knob on the machine
1	I 've taught him to put in the shower liner so that the floors do n't flood , he forgets and the floor is always flooded
1	He leaves the counters and mirror covered in hair shavings or toothpaste and once used one of my washcloths to plug in the drain so he could take a bathUpon learning this , I was so disgusted , I threw it away and wondered what else he had done to my thingsI took all of my stuff out of the bathroom and put them in my room
1	He is not allowed to cook anything on the stove because of the accidents he had burning pots , leaving the gas on , ect
1	He will often eat so much that he 's throwing up or clogging the toilet with his waste
1	It has grossed out many people who come over since I share the bathroom with him
1	I have had to fix the toilet several times because he 's using it so much
1	I tell him he ca n't eat 8 times a day because he ca n't afford a high food bill and he has to show selfcontrol
1	I did n't know someone could poop that much in a day
1	I am finishing up an internship so I can graduate college and he 's getting in the way of that
1	I already have too much going on in my own life and I have taken him on
1	I did n't expect this even though my fiance , who does sympathize and tries to be understanding , was right all along about me bringing him in
1	She knew I would n't be able to handle it and thought he needed to be in more capable hands
1	I feel like I have to check on him constantly , eat dinner with him , make sure he 's okay and it 's affecting my relationship with her , because with our busy schedules , we only see each other once a week and he ruins our alone time with his constant need for attention or does something crazyWhen she found out schizophrenia was genetic and my mother already shows major signs of it , along with an undiagnosed mental psychosis , she 's become a bit more uncomfortable
1	I am exhausted by him
1	He wanders off around the neighborhood and has caused trouble with people who came to my house talking to me in a threatening way about what he has done , such as peeping through windows , making gestures or dancing on people 's lawns
1	I do n't want him to say something to the wrong person and something happens to him or me because I 'm trying to defend him
1	Last night he said he needed to take a jog
1	I told him he needed to stay within the culdesac
1	He left around 7 pm
1	I fell asleep while writing an article and around 1 am , I wake up and he 's still not home
1	Ten minutes later , he comes knocking on the door , smelling like alcohol and giggling like a child
1	He said he crashed a party several streets down something he was n't allowed to do
1	I was so upset and overwhelmed , I took away the Xbox and turned off his internet while he was in the bathroom
1	I went in my room and when he realized what happened , he began pacing around the house , slamming doors , talking to himself and eating even more
1	The next morning , he starts yelling at me that he 's a grown man and he can do whatever he wants
1	He thinks he can handle so much and I need to treat him like an adult but has n't showed me he is capable at allHe has the mind of a child
1	He will start taking up bizarre and random conversations with my friends if they come over and they are n't sure how to handle him but they try to have a good attitude about itHe refuses to take any classes at the mental health clinic because he says the people there are too slow and believes he 's more normal than they are but his social worker thinks otherwise
1	He 's not allowed to obtain a driver 's license and he ca n't have access to his money
1	I try to explain that he 's not like me or any other person in the house
1	I ca n't provide him with what he needs
1	I feel like he is a full time job with overtime with no pay or benefits
1	I already have a mother who has mental problems and now I 'm dealing with him
1	I felt bad for him and that 's why I took him in but I ca n't handle it
1	My roommates are n't taking to him very well , he is n't retaining what I say to him , my already unstable relationship is going down the tubes because she thinks if we have children , they will have it
1	She 's also dealing with my mother and wellit 's a long story
1	My fiance goes through a lot being with me and I love her so much
1	She really wants to work it out but other factors are making her rethink things
1	My family nor his side of the family wants anything to do with him
1	If anyone can provide some advice , such as were he could live I live in Southern California , I would appreciate it
1	Hello guys , I need HELP
1	I was with my boyfriend for 4 years and we were living together
1	We broke up last March 2012 and spent 7 months apart
1	In the meantime , he was in a relationship and I was dating someone too
1	I started seeing this new guy like 6 months after we broke up and in the meantime , I did ask for my ex back but was rejected as he wanted to stay with that girl
1	Well , I was going in the right direction and getting better when my ex contacted me again at the end of October last year
1	He wanted me back and us to see each other again
1	He was going to break up with this girl if I say yes or no , and I did want to give it another try so I ended things with the guy I was dating
1	Me and my ex were seeing each other again so my feelings came out in the open one more time though he later confessed to me that he is not ready for a relationship
1	I still stayed as said to myself let me see how it goes but I could not deal with it that way so at the end of December I decided to stop things and he said he will accept losing me
1	A month down the line and I am finding it hard to deal with and some days I really see no hope but I keep on saying to myself that I need to get through this
1	Hey guys , I 'm in year 11 in high school and my stress is going through the roof
1	I 'm not normally a stressed person and normally I do n't get stressed about exams or tests but my year 11 exams are coming up soon and my stress has been crazy
1	I cry so much and it gets to the point where I physically feel like I 'm going to throw up for no reason , even if I 'm not thinking about exams or work
1	I ca n't concentrate , I ca n't think and I find myself reading the same sentence over and over again when I 'm studying
1	I m grumpy and tired all the time even if I get a 1012 hour sleep
1	I 'm healthy , I go to the gym and I drink plenty of water
1	I 've got plenty of study resources and and I go to the library a few times a week as well as studying at home
1	My family is very supportive and I 've tried to be in a positive frame of mind the whole time
1	I do n't have any mental disorders that I 'm aware of , but I just ca n't shake this feeling that I 'm going to fail , ruin my life and not have the opportunity to do something with my life
1	I do n't know what to do , I 've tried everything
1	We do exist , you know
1	I read these posts and I wish I had a daughter like the ones who post on here
1	My daughter is now 35 and she has been in jail twice , has been a drug addictnow supposedly soberhas had a child at 20 who she could not support and left with a bunch of people to take care ofuntil he finally was taken away from her
1	I raised my daughter myself until she was 7
1	Her father moved away , and never paid a dime to me for her
1	I worked my tail off to make sure she had everything
1	Then I remarried when she was 7
1	He was a wonderful step dad to her and gave her everything
1	Camps , great schools , clothes , toys , vacations just for her
1	No one would believe she is my daughter
1	Her friends and culture are as far away from mine as the North Pole
1	Well , they say you ca n't pick your parents
1	But you also ca n't pick your children or predict how they will turn out
1	You ca n't divorce your child
1	I know how painful these girls feel because I , too , am missing out now on so much joy I should be having , and could be having
1	To all the girls out there who post on here about their awful momsI am so sorry for you
1	My advice is do n't let it spoil your good nature
1	If you need them out of your lifeno one blames youat all
1	You know , most kids will do that on their own when they are missing a parental figure in their life
1	They will find oneto replace them somewhere
1	It may be the mailmanbut they will look for a mom , or a dad , somewhere , like they have a dousing stick for a mentor
1	So , if you are an adult childwith a lousy parent , you may benefit from that , too
1	There is a place out there for you where you can get out of your own head and give to others that will make you feel better and not so alone
1	Seek and ye shall findand remember Do n't ever UNDERestimate the power you have to change yourselfand do n't ever OVERestimate the power you have to change others
1	I feel sorry for meand I feel sorry for you
1	For about a year now I 've pretty much considered myself depressed
1	I 'm nearly positive it has to do with a chemical imbalance though and not past incidents though they do n't help it
1	I have a constant everyday feeling of worthlessness and extreme sadness that I ca n't seem to control , I have major concentration issues as to where I have to ask a person to repeat what they 're saying in order to understand , even things that I 've enjoyed for years I 'm unable to do even stand doing , I sleep literally all the time , I feel frustrated by even the littlest things , and I just have an overall feeling that I 'm a dead corpse
1	I 've been dealing with this issue for a year or two now because I was just terrified to tell my mother since she always takes pride in telling others how smart and great I am so I thought I would just disappoint her
1	I 'm going to be 16 soon though and I want to just move on with my life
1	I find myself uncontrollably crying everyday even in public places and I ca n't control it but I just want it to stop
1	I did finally tell my mom and her first reaction was disappointment
1	I immediately started crying and new I made the wrong choice but I ca n't go back now
1	Then she asked me why I was crying and I told her I do n't know
1	She then said she would try to get help and I made her promise not to tell anything
1	A month went by without her mentioning anything about it though
1	She did tell many people that I was depressed though including her friends , my sister , and my grandparents who all said there was nothing wrong with me and I 'm just going through a stage
1	When I finally confronted her about it again she said that she thinks I 'm depressed but it 's just something I 'm going to have to get over
1	I tried explaining to her I ca n't just get over it since it 's due to a chemical imbalance but she refuses to do anything about it and just keeps telling me You 're forcing depression on yourself because you want to be
1	Basically I have nobody else to go to about this since my family just tells me to get over it and that I have no reason to be depressed and I need to stop being so miserable all the time because it 's making them miserable
1	I do n't have many friends and my only friend I really thought could help got angry at me and told me I 'm not
1	I really just need someone to help me through this
1	I 'd really prefer not to call a helpline since I do n't want my mom to figure out she tracks my calls
1	Nobody else within the small family is willing to accept she has a problem and can often side with her and reenforce her episodes
1	We are currently forced to live with our parents while we save for a mortgage deposit until we are financially ready , which should be another 6 months
1	In the mean time I 'm worried about my partner having to take her constant mood swings , paranoia , delusions and made up stories that she then believes
1	She tells my partner to get out of her house , move out , find somewhere to rent etc , but when he says he will move out to his grandmothers because he ca n't cope with her anymore , she turns into crying and caring mother again and promises to change
1	Within hours she is back to abusive , argumentative and unhappy
1	She is threatens that if he leaves , he will not be allowed back and she will destroy his possessions and that the rest of his family will disown him
1	He knows he has to move away but I think he is petrified of losing his mother , and potentially other family members in the mean time
1	The upbringing he has had , has made him very nervous of confrontation
1	We do n't know what to do , whether to call her bluff and for him to move out , or maybe to attempt to keep her happy until we can buy our own home officially and try and build bridges from there
1	if he moves out , he will have to move to his fathers house which is even more of an extremely sore point , as even after 15 years of divorce , his mum sees her exhusband as evil and a threat to her and her perfect family delusion , which I think will cause even more emotional distress for her and if she truly has BDP , which I strongly suspect , I 'm worried for her mental wellbeing even more if my partner goes to his dads
1	Should my partner move out now and risk losing her all together
1	Does he stay put and put up with her abuse until he can get away when we are financially ready
1	I think both options will cause her great mental distress as she does n't like losing control
1	Getting her professional help is not an option , she wo n't listen to us
1	Since I tried to confront her nicely a few weeks ago about the lies she invents about me , she has banned me from the house and tells my partner we will never be OK ever again and she is disgusted with my partner for allowing me to confront her
1	She has told me my partner is a liar and has slandered her by telling me the lies she invented about me
1	All i did was ask that she stopped doing this , then we can have a nice relationship with eachother and she has flipped
1	She is walking around the house muttering to herself that there 's a Judas in the house , watch what you say about my partner
1	Hi I 'm a nurse of 16 years
1	My 55 year old brother called and told me he is hearing voices brining up the past when he did amphetamines 12 years ago
1	He went to the doctor and was told everything was ought of wack , however when he got off amphetamines at 43 years old he was hearing voices and was put on resperidal
1	He has not heard any voices since he took resperidal for 2 months 12 years ago
1	He recently changed jobs and is working with the people he used to do the drugs with and also has had a major break up with a girlfriend
1	He guarantees me he is not doing drugs however he said he is taking multiple vitamins ie excessive amount of vitamin c , vitamin d and vitamin e I do n't know if this has anything to do with it or not but I had him stop taking all the vitamins and told him to try glycine , Help I do n't know what to think or how to help him
1	He is reluctant to tell his doctor for fear of his new job finding out
1	I do n't know what to think but prior to doing the drugs he has never had anyother type of symptoms of schizophrenia
1	I thought schizophrenia did n't happen to people in their 40 's and 50 's that it happened in the teens and twenties
1	What suggestions can you give me if he refuses to go to a doctor
1	Hello everyone I 'm new , I hope you understand me , my first language is not English , but this is my experience trying to summarize a bit , two years ago , more or less , I having General Anxiety , some doctor told me I have also symptoms of OCD , and of course some depression , I have been prescribed , some wellknown medications , I get tired of taking them anyway because , it makes me felt that my life was not normal and I really did not like the way the medications made ​​me feel , for almost two months , I 've left the medications gradually , the beginning I thought it would be nice , but the anxiety started to give me problems especially on certain days a month , more exactly a week before my period , began to feel really terrified of my own thoughts , it 's hard to explain , anyway what I mean is that anxiety returned , more than a week ago I started taking the capsules of St John 's wort , the early days as I felt an improvement , but like three days ago , the anxiety is at its maximum point , I blame my PMS , apparently the herb St John is not enough these days , I had to take clonazepam , sometimes only half a pill because I had to calm down or go to sleep , I honestly do not know if , should go back to my psychiatrist or continue taking the SJW for longer to see if I finally feel a difference
1	I accept advice and opinions , thanks in advance , everyone have a nice day
1	I do n’t drink and I do n’t smoke
1	About three months ago , I had a lot of work , so I stayed up late for three or two nights
1	The symptoms I had are the following vomiting , dizziness , slight pain in my heart , and diarrhea
1	I could not even drink water , and I lost a bit weight
1	I visited a general practitioner who told me that it was due to fatigue , stress , or food poisoning
1	After a week I felt better
1	Almost a month and half later , I fell sick again , but this time it was very serious
1	He examined me again no blood pressure , no anemia , no diabetes , no heart problems connected my hands , legs and chest to a machine , my leg jerked when he tapped my knee with a rubber hammer , After almost 10 days , I felt better
1	Now it has been two months after the second time I fell sick , but some time during the day maybe once or twice a day , I feel a bit lightheaded and a slight
1	I live alone and far away from my family
1	I had never intended to datemarry someone with childrendivorced but life happened and i fell for him
1	When we met he was already divorced from both
1	Children are 9 , 14 and 16 the youngest is from his secondmost recent marriage i get along really well with the youngest and the oldest who is a boy
1	In my presence she holds onto her father continuously and previously sent me mail on face book calling me a witch and used all sorts of vulgarities
1	i got two emails at once and the next was her telling me the initial mail had come to me in error and was meant for an enemy
1	Falsei did n’t know she had any issues with me till then , , which she deniesi decided to distance myself from herwhich i know i should nt , however i am civil to her and discussed the issue at length with her father
1	The girls mother ex wife number one does not even respond to my greetings when we do happen to bump into eachother , she will however exchange greetings with my fiance
1	AS i do not know the woman i have decided not to bother with herHis last ex wife is pleasant and we say hello and chat
1	i have raised these issues with my fiance who has told me he spoke to the children etc in my absence as i am from another state
1	I feel overwhelmed , like i m not being heard
1	I have not been married previously and have no children of my own but grew up with several nephews and nieces
1	Please can soemone help me do things right and make the right choices so we can all be happy in the long run
1	I tried to talk to him tonight , to be honest I do n't know if I 've started the ball rolling in a good way or a bad   he did n't react very well to me attempting to discuss how he makes me feel when he calls me names   tried to get him to see my point of view in a nice , calm way
1	To be honest he flew off the handle at me two weeks ago yesterday   he had set the video recorder   I changed the channel without knowing   he never left a note   went totally balistic at me for it
1	I walk on egg shells as he has very bad arthirtis   is in pain a lot   therefore I try to make sure taps are not too tight etc in case something might set him off which it will
1	Therefore I 've been in the spare room for two weeks as I told him that I just can not go through this anymore but I do n't intend on leaving , I need him to get help for himself and somehow I need to get him to see this
1	I appreciate your imput   I really do want to support him
1	I have told him to think about things and to let me know when he is ready to talk
1	I 've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression by my doctor and was given Sertraline 50 mg
1	In February 2015 I started taking them and I got terrible shakes after a while but these seemed to have gone
1	I did n't think that the meds were helping me at all because I did n't see any improvements as I continued to feel anxious but less depressed
1	My doctor game me 100 mg to try and I 've been on them for at least 34 months now
1	I 've noticed that I 'm incredibly unhappy all the time and I 've been finding it difficult to sleep and will not sleep till after 4 am
1	I sleep through my alarms which prevents me getting to my university classes   I feel dizzy and nauseated quite often
1	I am 20 years old started the sertraline at 19 years old and I can not continue feeling so dizzy that I fall asleep and nap during the day , can not concentrate , and would prefer not to FAIL my university degree
1	I can not seem to get a doctors appointment as I can not get up to call at 8   and the receptionist wo n't listen to anything I say and suggests I book an appointment with nurse or pharmacist to renew prescription   but if I have side effects , I do not want to stay on these pills
1	I 'm too lethargic and it drives me crazy
1	I have random outbursts of over excitementhappinessjoy which last for an hour or less and then I because miserable for the rest of the day
1	I 've missed a few pills also , seems to be nearly every Saturday
1	I 'd missed 2 or 3 out of the 4 weeks in a month
1	I seem to feel very awake when I have not taken my pills
1	Also , someone mentioned to me that my contraceptive pill could be the reason as to why I have depression
1	That 's confusing but I 've taken Microgynon 30 since I was 15 and the only side effect I had was breast enlargement
1	Randomly when I was about 17 , they gave me Rigevidon instead , and would n't tell me why they changed my pill or give me an explanation
1	I am almost 23 years old
1	I have been medicated almost my entire life
1	I was on that for maybe a year at the most
1	Then I switched to Ritalin
1	About the 2nd grade is when I started taking Concerta in the morning and Ritalin around noon
1	I do n't know what dose of Ritalin I took
1	Some where in that time frame I also started to take Abilify which was at some point increased from 5 mg to 75 mg
1	By the time I was a senior in high school , I was still on all 3 medications
1	When I was finally of legal age , I wanted to stop taking medication all together but I knew I could n't just stop cold turkey
1	I had stopped taking the Ritalin the day after I graduated high school and have not taken it to this day
1	The other two I knew would not be so easy so when I was about 21 years old I had my doctor start decreasing my meds
1	I first the Abilify until I was no longer on it
1	Within a month or two I went from 56 mg to 36 mg
1	Within another month I 36 mg to 27 mg
1	Within another month I went from 27 mg
1	I stayed on 18 mg for maybe 3 or 4 months
1	Finally , about 3 weeks ago , I stopped cold turkey
1	I seem to be doing okay , but I can definitely tell that I am not medicated
1	I am very tired although I do stay up late a lot , I do n't focus as easily as I used to and I just feel different all around
1	I am definitely more sensitive emotionally which both my girlfriend and I see that as a good thing but I also seem to loose interest in conversation with people more easily
1	I will admit , I have been having odd thoughts lately
1	Is it weird or bad that I have these cravings for adventurous things that before I would have been afraid to try
1	i have always been down , i was diagnosed with social phobia a few years back and i have a psychiatrist whom i see every wednesday
1	I ca n't stand the way i feel anymore
1	Nothing good happens , i ca n't even have fun with my boyfriend anymore
1	I 'm so scared of what i am putting him through , he should n't have to deal with what ido to him and everyone around me
1	There is no one i can talk to anymore , i do n't want people to know how i feel , i do n't want to be that pathetic wreck that ca n't stop crying and shuts herself in her room for days on end
1	I ca n't handle going to school , i refuse to talk to my parents or my family
1	I just wish that for a day i would n't have to deal with this
1	I ca nt talk to my psychiatrist because he does n't know this is how i feel
1	Hello , I am not quite sure where to go as I wanted to ask some of you what you have went through before being diagnosed
1	My friend who is 27 displays odd behaviors but I am not quite sure if it is schizophrenia or paranoid personality
1	He was always very nice in person and then I noticed certain behaviors
1	I will list some of the behaviors or traits that I have noticed 1
1	Very hypersensitive to environment feels they are giving him dirty looks , laughing at him , smirking 4
1	Takes comments too personally and thinks comments are directed towards him when friends says people thinks it indirectly applies to him yet does the same when talking about others 6
1	Boastful and tells everyone how good he isonly in one on one settings yet says But I 'm not trying to say I 'm a better person to try to act humble 10
1	Paranoia thinks others are trying to make him mad at times ,   him off   11
1	Is helpful at times doing favours for other people but does it because he thinks it will bring him closer to god
1	Sensitive to rejection   says I had to go anyways if you initiate to get off of chat before he does , hard to get off the phone when you say you have to go 13
1	Thinks others are acting hostile when they are not accused me of having a rude tone when I clearly do not 14
1	When I opened up to him about my anxietydepression and was going through a rough time pretended like he cared but later threw it in my face and said he suffered more and what I am going through is nothing and he suffered way more than me or could even imagine
1	Tried to intimidate me through email saying we you trying to make me fight you over the most minor things such as laughing at him when I was n't 17
1	Believes he has some spiritual power can tell whether people are good or not by looking at them , seeing stars around people 19
1	I 'm 18 , and I 've been on a birth control called lutera for almost 2 and a half years now
1	My boyfriend of 2 and a half years and I have always tried to be as cautious as possible when it comes to ways to prevent pregnancy
1	Like me being on birth control , and if I 've taken antibiotics , no unprotected sex for an entire pack , and then not even having sex a full week into the next pack after the month I took the antibiotics
1	Well last night , I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend
1	And no , I do n't have to worry about STD 's , we 've lost our virginities to each other and have stayed loyal and faithful to each other this entire time
1	But anyways , we had sex , and he pulled out because it helps me to not freak out about having children
1	Anyways , when he pulled out , some of his sperm dripped down to my vagina
1	And I was n't freaking out too bad , except I got extremely sick last night and was unable to take my birth control pill until this morning
1	I have never been more than an hour late on my pill before
1	I need to know if I will have to watch out for pregnancy more than ever , or if I just continue to take my pills exactly on time I will be fine
1	My daughter has been acting all moody and angry the past few months
1	She always hurts her siblings with offensive words and always lets them down
1	Everytime i talk to her about her being responsible she responds with ' I do nt care'and she does n't take anything seriously and is careless about everything although she does well at school
1	I 've always talked to her about this but she never listens to me
1	When we talk sometimes she just blow up and starts shouting at me and acts very stubborn
1	She always locks herself in her room 24 hours
1	And as a mother it does hurt me when she mocks at me and hurts me with her razorsharp words
1	And what makes me concerned is when she 's very angry she hits herselfpulls her hair bangs her head at the door and starts shouting and crying
1	I try very hard to talk to her about this but her response is ' I do nt care about others , i care about myself onlyand i do what makes me happy ' which sounds a little bit selfish
1	Sometimes i think that she might be mentally ill Should i take her to a psychologist
1	Hello , I am unsure if I am pregnant or not
1	I had sex for the first time on July 28 after my predicted ovulation date July 26 I have been tracking my period and know my cycles are between 2730 days long
1	We did not have any kind of contact without using a condom and the condom did not break or slip at all , I am currently not on the pill
1	Afterwards we did not touch each other until we had cleaned ourselves up and put underwear on
1	I was expecting my period around August 9 and was having my usual pre period symptoms , cramping white discharge , acne breakouts but my period never came
1	I 've taken 3 pregnancy tests so far one the day before my period , the day after and the last day of my expected period today
1	I used two types clearblue and first response early detection all three were negative and I plan to take another this Friday
1	I keep feeling like my period will start and cramping but then it goes away
1	I 'm not sure if I am overthinking or freaking myself out or like my boyfriend keeps saying that because it was my first time having sex my body is adjusting
1	I know stress can delay my period and I do have a doctors appointment in a few weeks , I just would like to ask women out there as I do not have any close female friends and my mom passed away when I was young
1	I am 16 and have had the most wonderful life
1	I have the best parents in the world and have everything I could wish for but i can not be happy
1	For the last two years I 've been constantly moody and I ca n't remember the last time I was actually happy
1	I feel so bad about it because I know it will break my mum and dads hearts if I tell them I 'm unhappy because they 'll blame themselves and it 's not them , it 's just me and I feel so bad because I have no reason to be sad
1	Last year my friend tried to kill herself twice because of this girl who has caused some pain in my life too
1	This year I seem to have got worse and I hate it so much
1	I have anxiety and was diagonsed with it in October after becoming paranoid about my health I got weird head sensations , visual snow , lump in throat etc anxiety symptoms
1	Anyway , I 've tried to ignore the fact I have anxiety and move on but I 'm so low all the time
1	Like i said I have everything , but I 'm never really happy
1	I ca n't even go a week without crying its so bad
1	I do n't want to tell my parents because it will make them so upset and I do n't want that because i love them so Much
1	I 'm sick of it , I 'm so scared I 'm not going to pass my a levels because of this
1	I seem fine at school , but I 'm not
1	I come home and I break down and I do nt even know why
1	Before the holidays began my depression meds stopped working and now I am not doing well
1	My daughter and I help manage my mother 's care giver situation
1	I shop for her once a week and do her pill boxes
1	I have been to see my psychiatrist a few times and told him how severely depressed I am and how I struggle from minute to minute on a daily basis , but all he gives me are antipsychotic or antiseizure meds which are not working
1	I have bipolar depression and they put me on the lowest dose of lithium and I was zombied out and it had a very strange reaction with my thinking so I quit
1	I tried to see my counselor but it does n't seem to help
1	I bought a book on mindfulness and I am trying to incorporate it into my daily life
1	I brokeup with my exboyfriend because I did nt want to be with him in an abusive controlling relationship anymore
1	Afterwards all of his family and friends teased him because I would totally ignore him when he would come around , I treated him like he was a total stranger
1	Later on he called and apologized for his conduct and he wanted to meet and talk
1	I rode with him to his apartment and we had dinner and we talked
1	He said that he was going to go get some ice from around the corner at the 7'11 but never returned
1	Around 330am in the morning he came back and I was crying asking him to take me home and I explained to him that this was another reason why things were never going to work out between us and that it was over
1	He beat and raped me
1	While he was ejaculating inside me he was pushing himself inside me more as if he was trying to impregnant me on purpose
1	I was afraid because he would always threaten to have someone kill me
1	I believe him because he knew a lot of dangerous people that did nt mind doing him a favor
1	His controlling and deranged father came and begged me not to press charges and he also threaten me if I was to pursue it further
1	A few months I found out I was pregnant and I asked him for abortion money and he disappeared
1	My friends refused to help so i eventually asked his family and they refused as well
1	Nine months later my daughter was born
1	9months later he came over to visit and his mother asked could my daughter come to visit with her
1	He kidnapped her and took her over to one of his girlfriends houses
1	He had done to me what he had been plotting to do with his other daughter one night with me and because I did nt agree with him he beat me to a bloody plup
1	After calling the poilice he eventually bought my daughter home
1	ANother incident was when he came over to visit and it appeared that he had his fingure in my daughters mouth like he was teaching her how to perform oral sex
1	He may have been prepping her then now that i m looking back
1	We went to court and now we share custody
1	when she was 114 I over heard her mention that she had been sleeping with her father
1	I went crazy and cursed him
1	Prior to that I remember having to beg him for extra money to get her the things she needed cause I wasdnt working at the time I was sick
1	After I cursed him out about him sleeping with her he started giving her money all the time
1	A little while after that my daughter starte acting really sexual and was taking half naked photos with the monewy her father was giving her and sending it to a little boy in school
1	We had a big blow up and my daughtrer promised me she would nt do it again and then did it again the next day
1	She was lying to me about being sexually active all the wasy until i took her to the OBGYN
1	Later the following year my daughter was caught playing hooky from school and she was over yet another boy 's house having sex with him
1	You would think that she would have learned her lesson because when I took her to the OBGYN she was told she had HPV
1	One day I remember seeing her father scratching and it appeared that he may have had the crabs it was disgusting
1	When my daughter came back from her visit she was acting really strange and I argued with her that nite for being a smart
1	a few days past and one nite she fell asleep on the sofa watching tv do so I went and got in her bed
1	I woke up and a few days later I was itching
1	But she always lets her cousin wear her clothes and she difintley was having sex
1	Now that she s with him while she s going to school I really wonder if something is going on because everytime I call her she s getting in the shower and he does nt answer and she does nt answer and they always say the same thing and have the samwe excuse
1	One day i called her and I told her i was coming to get my phone from her and that I would call when I was on my way but I just popped up out of the blue
1	It took him a moment to answer the door but I asked him where my daughter was and he said she was in the bathroom
1	Sh ewas in there awhile and he did nt tell her i was there
1	His apartment is really small so i m sure she heard me thru the door
1	I knocked on it and asked her what she was doing and she said she was getting in the shower
1	I looked and her fathers clothes were on the toilet and her clothes was on the dirty clothes hamper
1	He was acting really strange and I asked what the hell he was looking so funny for and he just said nothing
1	i asked her wass he touching her or wass he making her touch him and she said no but she clearly is a liar and so is he
1	I told my therapist and she does nt think its nothing I spoke to another counselor and he told me that the legal age in MD for a child to have sex is 16 so if they are having sex then it would be conseual unless my daughter admits that he s forcing her
1	I asked her the othe day and she said no
1	I even asked him and he never says anything he ignores me completly and acts dumb
1	I think she s scared of what might happen if she tells thr truth
1	My daughter has two different personalities when she with me she fine and happy but when she with her father she s tempermental and angry as heck
1	She tends to las out at me a lot and when I offer my help she lashes out more and yells at me and tells me tnothing is wrong
1	Is she protecting him becauwse he may have threatened to kill me like he used to do me
1	I have a 3yearold and an now 32 weeks pregnant with second child On a daily basis i get up get my son to school and go to school for landscaping from 8a330p Big and pregnant or not i make sure i get up and do what i need to do to take care of my kidsand what does my bd do
1	When i first meet him he had a job and a olace to stay and everything but shortly after i found out about the first baby its like he stopped doing everything
1	He s 9 years older than me but in my opinion has the mind of a 15 yearold Not to mention also after i found out about my son
1	I found out he not only 3 kids like he told me after talking to his mom he had 6 kidswhich he does nothing for either
1	So now thanks to my 2 he has a total of 8
1	The only reason i have 2 is because i listened to the hype that he was going to do something with his life and he came to live with me and i believed we were going to stay together stupid if me to believe i know
1	But we live and we learn but
1	I said all that just to say i m so sick of dads making up excuses for not taking care of their kids while moms will break their neck to do what ever it takes to take care of their kids
1	Even if we were not togethet as a couple you still wo nt do anything for your kids and you kno they need all the things you need to live
1	I know my kids are ok and will never want for anything but i just hate the face that i have to do it all on my own when i did nt make these kids on my own
1	For past month I have developed a constant chest pain , also a shooting sharp pain to both sides of chest occationallyI will also have frequent abdomital pains that float
1	I run a couple miles every day , hit the punching bag for half hour or beter , and work out abs mostly for a while
1	if i could work out all day , i would
1	its the best I feel all day
1	When I am done working out , about 1520 minutes later
1	i only started the working out a few weeks back , the pains had started before i started doing thisThe sharp paiins are new since I started this
1	2 or 3 days out of he pst few weeks , i could barely find energy to do any thing
1	But once i could get going , I was ok untill a sit down and stop
1	I stop to see a doctor , blood presure is fine , breathing is fine , he told me be not going to be arterys
1	Could not really get any sort of answer out of him , I am wondering if any one out there has had this symptoms , and may know where i should go looking for answers
1	I recently got married to my sole mate … Happy News
1	He has an 11 year old son and an 8 year old daughter
1	I have an 11 year old son and a 6 year old daughter
1	It has recently been brought to our attention that his 11 year old son attempted sexual intercourse with his 8 year old sister
1	By attempted I mean he stuck his hard penis into her vagina , but when she started to cry because it obviously hurt he stopped
1	Ok I get that the “ definition ” of rape is “ the unlawful compelling of a woman through physical force or duress to have sexual intercourse ” and if he stopped when asked it might be difficult to call it rape … but I ’m not buying it
1	He is an extremely intelligent 11 year old boy I have often said he is a 30 year old man stuck in an 11 year olds body which even it is oversized for his age
1	I know this because he has NO modesty at all
1	He came out of the bathroom after showering one day with nothing on but a smile
1	I just so happened to come around the corner at just the WRONG moment and there it was
1	I shouted at him to cover himself and continued by saying there are young girls living in this house too , and behavior such as this is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated
1	He responded by saying I was overreacting
1	Moral to this long story is he knew what he was doing was wrong and his response once “ caught ” was “ I was curious and angry ”
1	I know it is normal for an 11 year old boy to be curious but once you cross this line it goes much beyond that
1	Sexual abuse in any sense is wrong , but there is a BIG difference between rubbing and touching out of curiosity verses penetrating your younger sister with your very large for your age penis
1	We ca n’t seem to get a straight answer out of either of them as to exactly how many times this happened
1	Such has him “ humping ” her while lying in bed together , him fondling her , etc
1	I know there are several questions such as why is he angry , why were the children sleeping in the same bed , etc
1	Background is my 11 year old step son was angry about his parents getting separated , and was even angrier that his little sister the victim was n’t angry about it
1	It has always been common practice for them to sleep in the same bed together if one or the other of them was frightened for some reason
1	Even when their dad my now husband still lived at home with them , this was common practice
1	He says as they got to be about 7 and 9 he told the mother that he felt they were getting too old to be sleeping together and she responded by saying they had raised good kids with strong Christian values , and they would never do anything inappropriate to one another
1	Now that the abuse has happened she continues to use the “ Christian ” approach and has both of them “ dealing with it ” by telling them “ the devil made me do it ”
1	Do n’t get me wrong I have nothing against religion , but telling children that the devil made them do something so horrible is n’t a healthy way of helping them deal with it nor is it a way of making the boy take responsibility for this horrible act he choose to commit
1	I know I am rambling , but I am so angry myself
1	I am angry that this happened to my stepdaughter , I am angry that my stepson is hurting because of the guilt he feels , I am angry that social services justifies it by saying “ these things happen and there isn’t’ anything we can do about it , I am just sad and angry all the way around
1	What I want to know is Is it a safe and healthy situation for both of the children to be allowed to stay in the same house together even though certain ground rules have been put in place to TRY and prevent it from happening again the mother has to sleep sometimes , and besides each time anything has happened she has been home , or should one or the other be removed from the environment until they can both be counseled
1	What my husband and I have proposed to both the mother and the social services is that we take my stepdaughter for a while until my step son can get counseling and they can try to get to the bottom of why he did this horrible act and most importantly how capable is he of doing it again , and secondly she can get counseling that is healthy and will allow her to cope and deal with this in a healthyhealing way
1	Would we be causing the children more harm by separating them even though only for a short while
1	If it helps , even before any of this stuff came out my stepdaughter begged us to let her live with us
1	When we would ask her why she did n’t want to go home she would just say the typical stuff you expect from kids coming from a split home
1	Mommy yells too much , I do n’t like Paul her step dad , my brother is mean , I have someone to play with here my 6 year old daughter
1	In reality I know it is the structure our house offers that she urns for even though she is too young to understand that is what she likes
1	my mom always used to get overly mad at me
1	she 'd throw me against walls for accidently spilling salt on the counter
1	she 'd tell mee how much she hated me and how she never wanted to see me again , then she 'd drive me to my dads house at 2 in the morning
1	one day , we were in the car and everything was fine , she asked me to call my uncle and i did
1	i hung up and told my mom he did nt answer
1	she started going OFF on me cuz i did nt leave a voicemail , Jesca what the hell
1	do you do this to all your friends too
1	then she slapped me across the face and cut my eye , i could nt see out of it for the day
1	my dad got so mad and threatened to take full custody of me
1	she got pissed and left me
1	she moved to england with her fiancee who she did nt even tell me about , i found it out
1	then she came back for a week wanting to see me but i refused
1	she went to arizona for a month then came back again but yet again i refused to see hershe left once again to arizona
1	my mom had always lied to me , she hid bad bad things from me and i ve found out MANY things bout her for the past nine years
1	she scared me for life by some of the things shees done
1	I am 50 years old virgin , got my ultra sound done very recently for the whole abdomen as adviced by doctor on account of having missed my period for the first time

1	my gynae cologist gave me a progetrone tablet called ' cycloreg ' to be taken for 3 days , two times a day
1	She said that i would get my periods and the cyst will disappear
1	She says because egg could not mature there fore turned into cyst and the reason why i had no periods
1	She say after this medicine we will wait and see what happens to the next period whethr it comes on time or not to decide further course of action
1	she also said the we need not do anything about fibroid as it sometimes disappears on its own
1	I FEEL ALL THIS HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE OF MY RIGHT SWADISHTHAN PROBLEM
1	please let me know what you have to sayWrite a reply
1	Hi , I 'm a 16 year old girl , and often in the mornings I felt unwell , which my mother decided was due to a hormone imbalance , so she gave me oil of evening primrose , which I took
1	About week ago , I started to become very depressed   I have had mood swings before , and am prone to quite low lows , if that makes sense
1	Sometimes I felt better again , but a simple , trivial comment fom my father like no , cut the potatoes a bit bigger would set me off again back into my depression , feeling like I was hopeless and could n't cope , an could never achieve anything in my life
1	I am not the sort of person who can really talk to my parents , i find it very difficult , as I do not get on very well with my mother a lot of the time , who just gets irritated if I am not my normal , happy self and struggle to expres my feelings even to my dad , who I am much closer to
1	Both of my parents dismiss anything negative , such as concerns about my appearence , as normal teenage stuff , but I feel I have it wose than I should
1	Friends as well are out of the question , as I do not really have anyone I trust and who I feel cares about me enough to listen another thing which worsenes my depression , and vice versa
1	So , my question is , is this connected to the oil of evening primrose supplement or my menstual cycle in general
1	Stupid question I know , but I have never felt like this before , wanting to just disappear and wishing my life would just end although i would not do that to my family
1	I started to improve over the last couple of days , and today I got my period , which has been the worst it 's ever been , with awful back pain and nausea is this also connected , and does this mean anything
1	I do n't know what 's wrong with me
1	At the beginning of this year I wanted a future I wanted more kids
1	I do n't want kids I ca n't picture the future I have this since of doom over coming me like my time is coming
1	I 've been having problems with my gallbladder , I have gallstones yet I ca n't find a doctor who will help me I 'm supposed to find a family doctor which is BS schedule three months out and for what
1	So they can schedule me with a surgeon
1	That whole thing has me all worked up and I only have insurance through the state for a year and if I do n't get help soon I do n't know what I 'll do
1	My father died 4 days after he had his gallbladder taken out
1	I have no idea why state of Iowa refused to preform an autopsy on him to determine cause of death
1	Said if we preform autopsy then you have to transport the body my family has no money for that kind of stuff
1	With me facing the same issue my father did I 'm afraid the same thing can happen to me
1	I do n't feel alive like I 'm rotting inside out
1	I 'm always tired but when I try to sleep I ca n't I 'm never hungry I have n't eaten in 3 days I 'm never thirsty
1	I 'm over weight I 'm not eating not losing weight
1	I 'm lost I try to think but my mind is so clouded I do n't feel pleasure happiness excitement I 'm empty
1	All I feel is sadness , like I just want to die , but no one wants to help me
1	I have a therapist appointment July 12 , but what if he does n't help me what if it 's to late what if I do n't make it
1	What if my insurance runs out and I still need help
1	My family they are all busy
1	My husband goes to school and college full time when I lay this on him I feel like he is just annoyed with me because he already has so much on his plate
1	I ca n't live my life like this anymore
1	My husband and son deserve better but I 'm so lost I do n't know what I can do
1	I 've lived my whole life like this off and on
1	Offs I 'll be great happy ready to live but every time I fell back into the slump it 's stronger more intense harder to pull myself back Everyday I get worse
1	For the past few years I have realized that I exhibit odd behaviors compared to everyone else
1	I discovered that I may have schizophrenia when I was researching paranoia , as I seem to have that also and they said that it is often a symptom of a more serious disease such as schizophrenia
1	Should I see a professional with these symptoms blank vacant facial expression sleep disturbances hypersensitivy to criticisminsults recurring bouts of depression and feelings of hopelessness low motivationenergyenthusiasm inability to form relationships social isolation increased withdrawal becoming lost in thoughts and not wanting to be disturbed by people replaying and rehearsing conversations outloud sometimes I do n't even realize that I 'm doing it until someone else has already noticed lack of goal directed behavior deterioration of academic performance inappropriate emotional responses I laugh at sad or scary eventsmemories frequent moveswalks that lead no where and serve no purpose ruminating thoughts becoming incoherent when trying to speak only happens when I feel nervous difficulty expressing thoughts verbally difficulty focusingconcentrating very poor memory Obsessive compulsive tendencies overpowering feeling that people are talking about me or watching me feeling that I am being watched spied on with electronic devices thinking that people can read my mind delusions of granduer erotomania not with famous people but often with professors I have experienced visual hallucinations twice in my life once within the last few months and the other when I was about 10 yrs old I know this is quite a list of symptoms
1	I feel like I 've gone about this with a level head and I certainly did not add symptoms that are not present
1	The warning sign that really made me think that I may have a mental health problem was the other day I feel I have very mild erotomania in that I always feel that my professors are attracted to me , like I mentioned
1	Anyway the other day my professor wore a sleeveless dress that exposed part of her back
1	I felt as though she wore it just for me
1	I also thought that as she was walking back to her desk , she was looking at the reflection in a glass cabinet to see if I was checking her out and looking at her exposed back
1	I wrote this in my journal and realized that there 's something not right about the way I 'm thinking
1	I guess I 'm just scared
1	I know with a list of symptoms like that I 'm probably going to need to see a professional
1	It 's just embarrassing and I was hoping I could talk to some other people on here about it
1	When I was a young child about the age of 5 , my parents got into a fist fight , my dad came home drunk and wanted me to go with him but my mom would n't let me , I remember this perfectly , my mom picked me up and my mom and dad got into a fist fight , I remember getting hit in the face
1	About a month later I moved in with my great grandma and lived with her to about the age of 11
1	When school started I was 6 , I would have nightmares every single night , this lasted till about the age of 11
1	Every night I would be scared to go to sleep because I knew I would have a nightmare
1	These nightmares consisted of people chasing me , me getting killed or finding dead bodies and even monsters comming out of the closet and grabbing me
1	When I turned 11 , I moved in with my mom , when she moved into the city
1	Those nightmares I had still affect me today even though I do n't have nightmares that often , I am scared to sleep by myself and I am almost 17 years old , this is a major problem for me
1	I can sleep fine though if I watch TV
1	to get rid of all the ghostmonster thoughts trying to grab me when i m trying to sleep or if i m at a place that makes me happy
1	I hate the dark and its hard for me to close my eyes because I have this paranoid thought that something is beside me , but when I look nothing is there , no matter how many times I tell myself that nothings there , I still think there is
1	I have bad depression and very low self esteem , I tend to have thoughts of suicide from time to time , I think my life is a living horror and that the only way to get rid of the pain and problems of my life is to end it
1	I have tried talking to my family members but they all think i m crazy , no one listens , no one understands
1	I am very poor at decision making skills , and in school i m probably one the shyest people around , I have problems keeping people as friends because i m scared that I will say something that will make them think i m weird , but i m so shy around people that I actually do start acting weird infront of people
1	I have trouble concentrating in school and I hate school more than anything and I feel as if no one understands me
1	I m only mostly shy infront of people that I want to impress , and I was popular in school I had quite a few friends but I gave all that up
1	people who I know like me as a friend I can be myself
1	I also find my self hearing voices in my head for example if i m thinking of my great grandma who I love and took care of me as a child ill hear a voice in my head saying something like I hope she dies even though that is not true
1	Since my dad and mother did n't get along , could this mean I ca n't get along with myself
1	If anyone could help me thank you
1	I am an 18 years of age and for at least 2 years now I have been seeing my doctor about severe lower abdominal pain and pain in and around my kidneys
1	My health has slowly decline and I am putting on weight for reasons beyond me
1	In the last 6 months my weight has risen from 9 stone to 13 stone with no physical change in my appearance
1	I constantly have trouble sleeping , shifting my own body weight and walking for long periods of time
1	I have been on the contraceptive Depo injection for 4 years
1	As a result of that I have no monthly period
1	This is seriously affecting my lifestyle , my self confidence and mental stress
1	I have been recently told by my GP that I may possibly have endometriosis , this was then more recently dismissed by a specialist as possible IBS
1	I have had various ultrasounds , to diagnose ovarian cysts but these tests were inconclusive , I have had only one set of gynaecological swabs mainly for cancer this only one test was also negative
1	As a result of this no other GP in my region will refer me for another test as as far as diagnosis 's are concerned this leaves nothing left but possible tumours or cancer
1	Am I correct I thinking a CT or MRI should be performed
1	i am 23 yofor the past 4 years i have been feeling differentit is getting worse and worse , and i am slowly loosing my friends and family over iti have an extreamly bad , short tempure , i ca nt tollerate anyone , im fidgity , im on edge , im anxious and my mind is constantly going ten to the dozeni have lost most of my family because of my tempure , i just ca nt tolerate anyone and i end up arguing with them , then after i regret itits like i get in such a state that its like its not me speaking its someone else and i ca nt stop myselfthe worst thing is my kids , im constantly shouting at my little boy , but i ca nt help it , its over stupid things asweli just feel rotten , and i know that something is not right , and if i do nt sort it out ill loose everyoneiv lost friends because they come round to my house , and somedays i m ok , but most of the time i m horrible to them and say nasty comments and i ca nt stop myself from doing iti feel so withdrwan from everyone , i do nt know how to have i civil conversation with people anymoreim just wondering if anyone has anything similar to this , or mabey knows what could be wrong with meim scared to go to the docs because i think they will fob me off and put me on anti depressantsany thoughts would be greatly appreciated
1	Back again , and with a few more questions   My boyfriend and I recently took part in manual sex
1	Although he never had any preejaculatory fluid on his hands , he never ejaculated , and I never touched my own vulva , I 'm still very nervous
1	We took part in this act about 4 weeks ago
1	I took one pregnancy test 10 days after we had manual sex , and one 15 days after as well both were negative
1	I had my period last week , and it was the same flow as always , and lasted for 7 days
1	I 've read many of your articles , and it says that manual sex poses no risks of pregnancy , but honestly , I 'm still very nervous
1	Some people say that you can be pregnant and still get your period is this true
1	My abdominal area has been pulsating , and my round ligament seems to act as if it 's being pulled and I 've read online that these are two common symptoms associated with pregnancy
1	I started birth control last Sunday , and I 'm guessing this is what has been causing my nausea , breast tenderness , carsickness , fatigue , and painful bloating
1	I know this is probably all in my head , but I do need some reassuring advice
1	I wanted to see if anyone else had a problem with this and how they 've maybe learned to change or deal with it
1	My father physically , emotionally , and sexually abused me growing up
1	He aslo physically and emotionally abused my two younger brothers
1	We were forced to put on a front as a result we all struggle with showing any type of emotion
1	We all learned at a very early age it did n't matter whether we lied or told the truth the result was the samebeating , screaming , belittlingsp
1	I am now happily married for 6 years to a man who has completely changed the way I view the world
1	He pulled me out of my shell and taught me you can show emotion , in fact , it 's necessary to live
1	He 's my protector , confidant , and basically my everything
1	There 's no telling where I 'd be without him
1	I am in counseling , but , here 's what I struggle with
1	I guess I do n't know how to seperate little white lies with the big ones
1	I lump them all in to one group
1	Logically , I know it 's not the same as what my father did but , I ca n't emotionally get over that
1	Once my loyalty is given to someone , I expect them to view it the same as me
1	I 'm extremely loyal , as my dh says loyal to a fault
1	This usually ends up in me being heartbroken bc I found most people do n't have this much passion about loyalty
1	Counselor has suggested one of our goals be a reality testDoes anyone know actually what this means
1	So since about February I 've been struggling with the idea of possibly being gaybisexual
1	I had a thought from my past
1	That I have n't remembered in years
1	I 've never ever wanted to be with a man nor have I evert thought about it
1	But around February one of these memories triggered me going crazy and doing whatever I could to figure it out
1	It drove me nuts thinking I 'm gay or bi
1	I did some research and found out that I might have hocd of course be of my impatience and want to find answers I commuted with all the rituals of have an intrusive thought looking to see if I find guys handsome if gay porn gets me aroused etc
1	I did watch a gay porn video once and it got me a little aroused but afterwards it grossed me out
1	At points I 'm fine and I do n't even think about it but sometimes its drives me up a wall
1	Around march I experimented with a close friend and it made me really uncomfortable
1	I 'll admit his lips were soft
1	Its only gotten worse and worse and more ibtrsuge thoughts just pop into my head and convince my mind and my body that its possible i m bi
1	But I 've never ever ever felt that way before and it was always so unappealing to me and my heart also disagress with my mind and body
1	I know the mind is a powerful so Idk if I 'm just   with myself and are slowly convincing myself of something that 's not true or if I 'm truly bi
1	I feel like experimentation will help but at the sake time I do n't want to do it
1	I do n't have the motivation and the first time made me so uncomfortable
1	I could n't breath and I almost fainted
1	This has practically ruined the last 6 months of my life
1	My relationship with the girl I want to marry went downhill and it put me into a state of suicide at times
1	I apologize for such a long passage but short and simple does n't work for me
1	Thank you for any support I do get or advice if I get anyAlso I 've never had feelings for a guy and I do n't get that butterfly feeling in my stomach and etc or have the emotional draw and attraction that I was reading about and saw videos on
1	And I tell myself but I want it
1	But I can picture myself in a relationship with a man and I do n't want to be
1	I 'm looking for help for my bipolarADD son
1	He has been struggling for 6 years to get stable
1	He currently takes Abilify , Lamitcal and Vyvanse
1	Now the dr will not let him go to a higher dose because that is the max and he does not want the liability if something happened
1	My son now can not stay awake through the day
1	He literally is half asleep all day takes several naps and sleeps through the night
1	He became obsessed with surfing the internet and he started shuffling his feet , hunching his shoulders and squinting
1	Vyvanse did not do that to him
1	I ca n't believe how hard it is to get him the help he needs
1	Any ideas on what we can do or how we can get the help he needs
1	My dad died unexpectedly a few years ago
1	I watched him die for 14 days
1	It was very traumatic for me and my family
1	After that , I had a long period of worrying about my own health and my families
1	After that , every new ache , I thought I had a new serious problem
1	After a year of that , I slowly got over those thoughts
1	They were replaced however by muscle pains which I feel are from stress
1	Work is very stressful for me , I have added strain from increased family responsibilities with my dad gone , etc
1	I worry constanty which makes my upper back , shoulder , legs , knees etc , ache
1	I just had a physical a month ago and the only issue I have is a below normal vitamin D level
1	I have been taking Vitamin D 2000 iu daily for the last 3 weeks
1	I am 6 foot , 195lbs and for the most part a fit person   35 years old
1	The only times I have relief are intense exercise , sleeping or if my mind is totally distracted
1	I now am even starting to hurt after sleeping and my sleep is interupted
1	Please give me your opinion of what my next steps should be
1	this is n't really about depression but it has the teen element So I thought I 'd post it here too So I 'm pretty close to losing my best friend
1	I 'm always mean to her
1	Okay yes I am probably very mean to her
1	But it just does n't seem mean to me because I 'm pretty sure I have schizophrenia , or at least a form of it
1	But I always think SHE 'S the one being mean , and I guess I just get into a bad attitude sometimes
1	Call her or one of her other friends a name she yells at me that I do n't ever say sorry
1	I want to say sorry so badly but when she tells at me a little voice in my head is like you ca n't say sorry now , she 's being just as mean to you
1	Yet I constantly rehearse apologies in my head to her
1	I just ca n't tell her how I feel
1	We are very close but I ca n't tell her i 'm mentally ill
1	I once tried to tell her in a joking matter and she got very mad at me
1	She said that I should have told her earlier and that she could n't trust me anymore , so I told her I was just kidding
1	I honestly do n't know what to do anymore , this makes me so sad
1	so , i have been on here before and it helped a lot writing everything down i ve tried calling the suicidal hotlines but its just so hard to sit there and try to cry and talk about everything that s upsetting you to a totally stranger who you know feels bad but only can tell you everythings gon na be alright which i m starting to lose hope on
1	i honestly do nt even know where to begin before i do you guys will have to know some things first i m 15 i live with both parents now an important person to know is Billy who is a boyfriend that i dated for 10months after that i was on and off with him for awhile and were back together we are very close i let myself be vulnerable to him and i ve let him touch me in ways i d never let anyone touch me meaning yes we have had intercourse something to know about my past is that i used to cut from 5 till the end of 8th still a little on and off here and there
1	i m about to be in tenth its about 2 months away
1	now here my story   2012 was a pretty great year i had a wonderful boyfriend who was with me all the time doing everything with me , 2 great bestfriends who were my sisters , my amazing dad who worked 6days a week sometimes 7   but i had a horrible mother one who would hit me when she got mad at her boyfriend on the side or when she did nt have pills to make her happy
1	having 4 people by my side to help me through that was everything to me i could nt stand on my own two feet
1	in the beginning 2013 my mom started to come around meaning she stop hitting me and taking her anger out on me but i still till this day ca nt forgive her   my sister had told me she was thinking about moving far to north carolina i live in ohio   this crushed me i could nt even deal with knowing i was about to lose my sister the one i ran to for everything because i knew when she moved down there things would nt be the same and they really are nt
1	after that happen me and my boyfriend broke up two days before are ten months and i was so attached to him i cried for days i did nt even wanna get outta bed i withdrawled from everything it was crazy   a couple weeks after that i found out that my daddy had cancer
1	a tumor in his brain and he had stage 4 in his chest
1	guys are you listen   are you still there
1	the day we found out about my dad having cancer he asked me to be strong for him to let him cry on my shoulder
1	and that s what i did   i think that i took it wrong because every since then i stopped letting people see how i felt i became this girl who was so strong onthe outside but truth is i m soo weak on the inside that i m suprised that i can even fake that smile   me and billy have been on and off but i feel like things will never be the same because he ca nt get over what happen with us he says its his fault that he can never make it up but i really love him all the past erases when he s holding me tight when he has his lips pressed against mine the whole world fades away and its just US standing there   me and my sister barley talk but i try to talk to her every once and a while   my dad had surgery and is doing ok but i fear that he s become like me hiding his emotions away from us to look like he s stronger now and not the guy who cried for hours when he first found out   me and my mom were ok i guess i still try to avoid her at all cost   my other sister and i are trying to get close but honestly she has so many problems of her own i feel bad to put all mine on her to   and finally ME   i ve become that girl who cries herself at sleeps but she s smiling in the morning acting like her life is nt crashing down around her   i ve wanted to just end my life but i care about these people way to much to hurt them in such a way   people have asked me why do i cut some say its a   move if you wanna die then kill yourself but honestly i do it because i become so numb where i ca nt even cry out the tears have all fallen down my cheeks my mind erases everything and i just lie there until i feel myself moving to find the blade and as it touches my skin i feel no pain when i do that s when i stop
1	and i do nt even try to hide them my parents never notice just some friend and even then i have the perfect lies if they do nt believe me i let them think what they want these are my battle scars i m staying alive for the who has my heart , my daddy , my sisters , and the women who gave birth to me and that s it the others i could give a   about there opinion of what i do with my life doesn bother me and never will but if your one of those five you best believe ever word you say to me good or bad i replay over and over like a cd skipping   but anyway i really do nt know what else to write this helped me a lot with the pain i was feeling now better then cutting
1	a year ago i was on zoloft after dislocating my shoulder and waking up with numbness in my skull   for 3 monthss it was like it til i met a chiropractor who showed me proof it was my c1 and he cracked my neck into place 3 weeks later pain was gone i was feeling 100   again   sadly i was still on zoloft i weened off them and always felt like my emotions were turned down a notch i m not as scared anymore and such i thought over time those chemicals would build back but i kept having nightmares waking up in cold sweat i was glad though to be away from that pain last monday i had a stabbing feeling in my eye after having a hard week finding out my dads cancer spread i was slouching heaps going hard with exerise but at the same time trying to do the right thing when i noticed my feeling are not showing as much as it should i should be upset or mad next day someone crashed into my car and took off without leaving a note i felt like i cracked abit but i should of been more mad then what i was   then i realised that stabbing feelings gotton worse so i went to a dr and he said it was stress strange enough i stood up straight instead of slouching and the pain vanishes   right now i have no pain but the anxiety is bad i never wanna go back to a vegetable thinking i was mentally sick when i was nt sorry if this is messy i m writing this down on a tablet
1	I have had issues with my 2 adult stepchildren since marrying their father 9 years ago
1	I helped to raise the younger son , and he refuses to speak to me since we moved to Hawaii five years ago
1	He acts like I do n't exist
1	We give them gifts and Dad is the only one who gets thanked
1	Birthdays are n't much bettermine are basically ignored while Dad gets the treatment from the grandkids phone calls , cards etc There are things that have happened that I do n't want to go into , but this treatment is very hurtful for me
1	I have tried my best to be nice and include them in everything
1	The son , who has never said thank you once , used to call and wish me Happy Birthday and Mother 's Day , but since we moved , he basically told Dad he had to pick between him or me
1	I do n't know how I am supposed to actI do n't want to participate anymore as I feel they are controlling the situation and let me in when they want and push me out when they want
1	I feel I am setting myself up for getting hurt if I allow myself to get close to them or their kids
1	I do n't have kids of my own and basically feel that it best I just let them go and not get sucked into the situations
1	so , i m a bisexual girl , please do not judge me for this
1	since 6 years ago i met a girl and fell in love , we 've been dated for 4 years and through the bad and good conditions together
1	Actually i have n't check to any psiciatry but i m sure that i have BPD
1	i m 19 now and my gf is 20when we argued , i always ended say i want to break up , but she dooesnt want to
1	she is so patient to me even she know about my BPD
1	i have a bad enough mood swing , but i think she is my soulmate because she always be able to calm me down
1	the way she look at me makes me believe that she loves me and will end up in good relationship that we 'll grow old together
1	6 months ago , she cheated and left me , i m so depressed because she treated me really badbut after i can forgive her and try to move on , she came back and 2 months ago we try it all over
1	but now , suddenly , she left me because she thinks i will much happier if she is not around , it makes me more depressed
1	i ca nt let her go , nor move on
1	leaving alone is so hard because i m to depending on her this whole time
1	i m so afraid that i ca nt love again , and i m so afraid that i ca nt start my new single life
1	I have some indications that I might have this
1	Like , I worry that some of my frineds will eventually not want to be frineds with me cause they do nt want to deal with me
1	I continuously have to be reasured that they are n't mad at me and it'sstarting to annoy them that I ask all the time
1	Sometimes i am way too hyper around them cause I ca n't help myself sometimes , like , I am so wound
1	I get incredubly anxious over the probablility of them being mad at me and when anyone is mad at me , I get incredable y upset and have to make sure they arne't
1	Like , I worry that they will block me on AIM and constantly have to check and i always worry that people are talking baout me cause they secretly do n't like me
1	there are times when I am soo happy I ca n't even control myself and say dumb annoying things , i m just soo wound and then later in the day I am bwling my eyes out feeling really depressed that either the kid I like does nt like me back , or my frineds are mad at me , whatever
1	I love people , I am outgoing and love interacting so its just when Ia m alone mostly that I feel that way but it is always in the back of my mind
1	I have generalized anxiety and I take medication , it works so well compared to where Iw as a few years ago so my meducation is working well but this whole thing still makes me anxious a bit , there is alwasy somehting ont he back of my mind
1	What do you tink , do I sound borderline or what
1	I am 14 years old and going into the ninth grade
1	I 'm sorry for the length of this , I just need help
1	I 've been talking to myself for as long as I can remember , well , since 2011 anyway
1	I used to have lists that I kept by memory
1	I remember in the 4th or 5th having one list with like 2630 and others with anywhere from 1017
1	And as for the lists , I still make them from time to time , some in my head and some in my memos
1	More so in my head and by memory , and I did a few by paper
1	The ones by memory are n't as big now , but the ones I 've had on my phone in my memos have went past 30 and I think to around 40
1	Those lists are things I planned to talk to myself about , and even if I never did , I felt assurance having them
1	I still viewed them and ran through them , saying something small about them and what they were
1	Sometimes I ca n't find the words or I do n't like the way I word them as I talk , so I get stuck on one topic on the list and go on and on
1	I have n't made one on my phone in a while , though
1	I mean now , I usually try and just say it when I can
1	But it gets hard to move further when I ca n't say them
1	When I struggle to say it how I want to , I said it aside for later
1	And sometimes they open up more or something else happens and they all pile up
1	And sometimes I just want to cry because I ca n't say them right or because I 'm bothered so much by them
1	Several times I could n't complete classwork or tests or something school related because I was too busy trying to talk about something
1	And I get scared that people see me sitting there , muttering beneath my breath
1	Several times of not countless , I 've pretended to be working or something when I was really talking to myself
1	And sometimes I guess I somewhat zone out trying to talk to myself and I have to do write at least something from time to time so I have something on my paper
1	In lunch one day , I kinda like , zoned out and sat away from everyone else so I could talk to myself
1	I think I had people come up to me , but I would just say I 'm thinking
1	I had my hands over my mouth talking into them
1	I think I 've got away from people several times to focus and try and say it
1	If I do n't I get overwhelmed and want to cry or just , I do n't know
1	I 've went outside claiming to check the mail , and I did check it after like 10 minutes of talking to myself
1	Sometimes they pile up and I try and talk about them all and remember them all
1	I 've sat with my earbuds in like I 'm listening to music when really I 'm talking to myself , or at least having the conversation in my head
1	If I do n't , I get restless or frustrated
1	Like , today for example , I made sure my guitar pick was where I left it and I ran back to check it like three times even after I had seen it
1	I had to go back , I just , I had to
1	And eventually after several back and fourths , I went back and tapped it just so that I knew I had touched it and that it was there
1	I did the same with some rolled up gum wrapper the day before
1	I was leaving for a friends and I made myself touch that on my way out
1	I just , I have to do certain things before I allow myself to go further , otherwise I feel discontent
1	The need to touch something or feel it , to read words on a sign in Walmart just for my comfort
1	I 've read whole lists of things , like what 's on a box or book or magazine simply for my assurance
1	I do n't know how I deal with these things , but please , help me
1	Greetings , I 've been having very strange symptoms that NOBODY has been able to figure out
1	I did get diagnosed with Hepatitis B during the summer so of course my concern was liver cancer
1	I found out about this because I kept having a feeling like I was going to pass out or faint
1	Since then , I 've seen a number of doctors and specialists MD , Neurologist , Cardiologist , ENT , etc
1	who could not find anything wrong with me other than Hepatitis B and suggested I had a vestibular dysfunction of some sort
1	However , sometime in AugustSeptember , I had pretty rapid weight loss
1	I went from 212lbs192lbs in a matter of a month , and this was without any exercise
1	On top of this , I 've been very weak lately , lost a lot of muscle mass in my arms and legs , some loss of appetite , wake up neausous every morning along with stomach ache , which go away once I get moving on top of this , I 've been having an issue where I ca n't sit in elevated levels bar stools , stadiums , work chairs , etc
1	as I feel like I 'm being pushed from behind and I 'm going to fall forward or just pass out and faint   but I never have
1	Asked my doctor about it and he said I should not worry about cancer , mainly because of my age 36 and I was not having bloody stools , blood in urine , clay colored stools , real pain anywhere , etc
1	Everyone keeps telling me that since my bloodwork showed no cancer , I should not be worried
1	I also went to a Reiki healer who works specifically with cancer patients , and she told me she was always able to sense the negative energy from cancer patients in all stages and she was not able to detect any in me   and everything seemed organically fine with me Yes , I know it sounded crazy to rely on this but I am willing to try anything to help symptoms I keep having
1	I have a ten yr old step daughter that lives with us 4 day 's a week
1	Her father does not disipline her at all and anything i say goes unheardMy problem is I need to know if me and several other people are crazy , The ten yr old when she is with us lay 's all over her dad , will not play with other kid 's and was even sleeping with him until i put a stop to it
1	He was also letting her come in the bath room with him saying she was to young to know anything
1	She will also do evrything in her power to keep me and him from sleeping in the same bed when she 's therer
1	He say 's she is his best friend and i thought your wife was your best friend
1	Anyway people have started to question me about her actions with her father
1	Do nt get me wrong i do not think he is abusing her , but there is a unhealthy relationship between her and himHe does not not see it , he is a only child also and does not understand that there is lines not to be crossed when they reach a certain age
1	I just need help here trying to explain to him what she is too old for and such
1	She is also like this with her grandfather and step dad
1	I 'm worried about her because she does not act like a ten yr old child
1	and i need to know how to handle this or my marriage is going to be over
1	Hi , I 'm 17 years old , I 'm a senior in High school , and I live in average middle class home
1	Nothing is really wrong with my life , I 'm healthy , attractive , popular , and intelligent , but even though I have a family that loves me , a group of friends at school , and a best friend , i still ca n't help but feel so sad all the time
1	This feeling of being so low started about a year ago , I think what sparked it was when I broke up with my boyfriend
1	But the thing is , even when I was still with him several months before , I remember sitting in my room and wondering how is it possible that i 'm still not happy
1	So I know that this sadness was creeping up on me long before I broke up with him
1	I find myself sulking around more and more , and a genuine laugh is so rare for me now
1	I used to text everyday , and now I text maybe once a week
1	I 've also gained 7 pounds , and I have gotten more acne
1	I 'm a lot more emotional , little things make me break down and cry
1	I cry all the time , sometimes I 'll start wailing when nobody 's home , but there 's no particular reason why
1	My best friend contacted my dad and told him she thinks I need to see someone professional , she 's the only one who really knows what 's going on
1	I tell the rest of my friends excuses almost daily , but I think they 're catching on
1	My parents asked me if I was depressed , and I lied and reassured them I was fine
1	I just do n't want to cause anybody trouble , I do n't want anyone to worry about me , but it 's becoming a problem
1	Lately , I 've been having thoughts of suicide , even though I know i 'd never really do it
1	I keep thinking things like what 's the point of even being alive , or I just want to end this suffering
1	It 's so scary that these thoughts are actually running through my mind , a year ago I would've never imagined I 'd get to this point
1	It seems like it 's just getting worse and worse , so I do n't know if i should start seeking help or stay strong and push through
1	I really do n't want to take medication , I do n't believe in that
1	And starting therapy does n't seem like it 's worth it since i 'm moving away to college in less than 4 months
1	I do n't know what I should do
1	I 've tried Paxil , Effexor , Wellbutrin , Celexa and others , but always seem to suffer with some pretty bad side effects on all of them
1	With the Paxil , I had insomnia , really bad night sweats and GI problems
1	With the Effexor , I had really bad insomnia , heart palpitations and anxiety
1	With the Wellbutrin , I actually got more depressed and even had a road rage incident while on it
1	And the Celexa reacted badly with my blood pressure meds causing ongoing PVC attacks and bouts of afib
1	So , I 've pretty much given up on them at this point
1	The doctor also gave me Xanax PRN , but I have been taking one 1 tablet on a daily basis , and it seems to be helping more than the previously mentioned meds without the side effects other than some really weird dreams
1	The only issue is that my doctor calls Xanax a high , and does n't believe it should be taken daily
1	However , it has been working for me , so when I go to him this Friday for a follow up on the Paxil , I am going to tell him that I want to be put on Xanax as a daily dose and that I really do n't want to be put on the AD meds anymore
1	Ok basicly I 'm 15 and for the last few months I 've been haunted by a nickname that I despise with a passion
1	One of my best friends thought of it one night and it could have died that night but others kept it alive
1	Since then I 've been refered to it by everyone I know at school btw and it makes me want to snap just hearing it
1	I 've begged with my friends to stop , I 've shouted at them and even stopped talking to them
1	There is one in particular who I just started to despise weeks ago
1	Just the sight of him makes me want to hit him
1	and they know I hate it but keep going on
1	Every week or so when I get so pissed with them it 's all ' Oh , I love you really '
1	but if they did love me they 'd stfu
1	I 'm very , very close to dumping them but I do n't know what to do because I wo n't have any mates then
1	I have important tests coming up in school , which start tomorrow and the last thing I need on my mind is this
1	Can you answer am I depressed and what advice can you give me
1	I 'm desperate at this point , Please help me
1	Four weeks ago , my 16yearold son , Will , lost his best friend in a very , very unexpected suicide
1	And ever since then , it seems to me like he 's been in a deep depression
1	His eyes have no light in them , and he 's eaten so little that he 's lost a frightening amount of weight
1	His sleeping , too , has been affected , and it 's like he 's going to collapse from sheer exhaustion
1	And when I try to even talk to him , he just ignores me all together and acts like he did n't hear me
1	He 's been going to school , but he has n't done any homework at all , as far as I can tell , and according to the online gradebook our school has he 's pretty much failed every single quiz and test he 's taken since his friend 's suicide
1	Will 's very intelligent and his studies are important to him he wants to go to Yale , and he knows he has to get good grades
1	And he quit the varsity soccer team as wellsoccer was his life
1	And this morning , my 10yearold daughter accidently bumped into him and he completely flipped out
1	Like , he screamed at her for a full minute and threw the box of cereal he was holding at her face before stomping up to his room I 'm just glad it was n't something more dangerous
1	And that 's the most emotion he 's showed in the last three weeks
1	I think that the grief and guilt and stress he 's carrying around have completely buried him and I 'm worried for both his safety and ours
1	I know he needs help
1	I 've never seen him like this before , and every day it gets worse
1	And my gut is telling me that something is seriously , seriously wrong
1	So I scheduled an appointment with an adolescent psychologist for yesterday
1	Should I force him to attend a session
1	I 'm a single mom , and he 's much taller than me
1	I 'm so worried for my son
1	I have been taking Celexa 40 mg for 8 months and Adderall 20 mg XR for 2 months
1	Quickly — however — negative sideeffects surfaced and continue to worsen to this day More apathetic Reduced affect display and emotional response Difficulty feeling and discerning emotion Libido almost nonexistent Little enjoyment in things I usually enjoy I feel Celexa 's negatives outweigh its positives
1	Taking Adderall also increases my heart rate , and I feel physically more nervous , despite anxious thoughts not being present
1	I would like to remain on Adderall , as the treatment for my ADHD has given me a substantial boost in confidence and learning , which has been invaluable and overshadows its negatives
1	I have been having difficulty breathing where i have to keep taking deep breaths , feels like my heart is racing at times , have some muscle twitching all over my body and my throat feels like it has something stuck in it , although the symptoms never seem as bad if iam not thinking about it sometimes even go completely , but when i do have these symptoms it drives me crazy , i am only 18 and its scaring the   out of me , i went to the hospital and had an ECG done and the nurse said my heart was slightly beating to fast also had my BP done and he said it was slighlty high but he said it might be because i was stressed about the test he also checked my oxygen levels but they were fine , i also had a chest x ray and nothing was wrong with that , also had blood tests and they were also fine , i really do n't know what is wrong with me , maybe its anxiety or depression , i am seeing my doctor tuesday for more information about it , what could this be
1	PLEASE HELP ITS DRIVING ME UP THE WALL , its also stopping me from going out my house to see my mates , it has also put me off eating , sometimes it scares me that much i think i am going to die
1	Following the trip to the hospital i went to the doctor , she took my BP and said it was fine , she never done any other tests on me because she said there was nothing wrong with me because i had the tests at the hospital and after telling her about why i might have anxiety she agreed and just sent me on my way
1	I m currently 16 Last year i suffered from depression and had paranoia when it came to realtionships with friends and family however i have some incidences over the past few months which have really scared me , my parents left me home alone and i was sure that there was something outside my door and that i could nt get out of my room , my prents had to come home and i was on the floor screaming , we do nt really talk about it they think somebod slipped me drugs that s the only conclusion they can come to

1	My daughter is 4 years old
1	Her father has rarely been in her life
1	He told me at the time that we got together that he was in the middle of a divorce
1	My pregnancy came as a complete surprise as I had been on birth control
1	I found out at that time that his supposed divorce was not true and that he was married the whole time
1	He dumped me and had nothing to do with me until I sued him for child support after Melody was born
1	He never told his wife anything
1	She found out when he was served with child support papers
1	I was almost 40 when she was born
1	At one point , they almost delivered her 2 months early because they thought I was in liver failure
1	My job was great and very flexible with me but I was out of work for over 4 months during the pregnancy and after she was born
1	Because the pregnancy was a surprise , I had no short term disability and had no money coming in and no help from Melody 's father at all
1	Thank God for my family because I would have been out on the street without them
1	Gary refused any contact at all and would have completely walked away from the entire situation if I had n't sued him for child support
1	The initial hearing took place when Mellie was 9 months old and even then , he insisted on a paternity test
1	So , the first time he laid eyes on her was when we had the paternity test when she was almost a year old
1	Gary 's wife told him that she would only stay with him if he promised never to see Melody or have anything to do with her
1	He saw her sporatically after our initial court hearing and said that he was sorry for being such a jerk and that he wanted to be a good father but it had to be in total secrecy   he only came when he could lie to his wife and get out of the house , but this last year , he has not seen her at all
1	I have accepted long ago that he is a loser and will never be a real part of Melody 's life
1	It is beyond me how anyone could not be involved with a human being that they created , but I ca n't make his choices for him
1	I still struggle with the grief I feel for bringing a child into such a terrible situation
1	She is a lovely and wonderful little girl , and I consider her my late in life surprise angel
1	I try not to feel guilty for her growing up without a father
1	I am divorced with a teenage daughter who spends a lot of time with her father , and so it is even more apparent to Melody that her dad is not around
1	She talks about him and is always talking about the time he picked her up from daycare and took her to lunch in his big red truck
1	She thinks it happened recently when in reality it was the last time she saw him over a year ago
1	I believe that she may never see him again at this point
1	How do I answer her when she asks about her father
1	Do I give her presents and say that they are from her dad
1	Do I tell her she may never see him again
1	When she asks , I 've been telling her that he lives far away and ca n't come to visit her , but she 's growing up and that excuse will not suffice for long
1	I would really appreciate any advice and suggestions that anyone has for me
1	My gynecologist prescribed me lo loestrin fe to help with irregular and painful periods
1	I started taking it the first day of my period , Dec 25
1	I continued to bleed until Jan 20 CD 27the last white pill before the brown placebo pills I also had sex on Jan 21 around 100 AM using the withdraw method correctly
1	I took a pregnancy test Jan 28 and it was negative
1	I was also having my usual PMS symptoms backache , bloating , cramps , dizziness , nausea , breast tenderness   then started bleeding like a normal heavy period on Jan 29 would be around the time my next period would have been if I did not start birth control
1	my cycles were around 3335 days which lasted until Feb 3 6 days
1	I took a first response early detection pregnancy test with 1st AM urine on Feb 5 16 days after sex   it was negative
1	Since then I have been having nausea , breast tenderness , fatigue , mild cramps , headaches , dizziness , depression   major anxiety which are also side effects of the pill for the first 3 mths
1	In the past I have fooled myself into thinking I was pregnant multiple times when I have never been
1	I am worried that I may be pregnant despite having bled for 27 days straight on the pill , using the withdraw method only time we have not used condoms , having my period and having 2 negative pregnancy tests
1	I also take my birth control every single day to the minute   have never been late , skipped a pill , or taken anything to interfere with the effectiveness
1	i m a straight male i went out to a party 2 weeks ago and was roofied thankfully we left the party and went to a bar before the roofie kicked in at the bar i remember nothing though all i remember is falling down and hurting myself , and then a stranger asking me to get out of his car i fear that i was anally raped i m very paranoid and this fear has n't left me in 2 weeks
1	if i had in fact been raped , how would i feel the next day
1	i had no anal pains the next day and my clothes looked clean and on right but 3 days after the party , my anus started feeling a burning sensation maybe because of the alcoholroofiestress and diarrhea and 10 days after the party , i developed a perianal abscess i get these from time to time i have been having breath taking panic attacks daily over the thought of possibly being raped anally
1	i think the stress has even given me intestinal problem too my intestines are cramped and they hurt please , can someone open up and tell me if you feel pain the next day after anal rape
1	or do you feel pain a couple days later
1	mine started at the sphincter as a burning sensation now i feel as if i m being poked by a pin in my anus like a crawling feeling just in the anal opening please help me out
1	I had depression on this incident And if someone touch me i think that guy who touch me prick me with contaminated needle , , I posted this thread to hepatitis and hiv expert forumi think my palpitation came from this incident I was on the hospital to check my blood sugar level and S Creatinine for my monthly check up
1	The nurse open the new needle in front of me but i refused to use the needle that she open on me
1	The nurse then put the 1st needle on the table and she ask me to get a new needle and open it
1	Even a single second i did not miss to look away to that needle but when the nurse drawn my blood she inform me not look and i follow her
1	I check the table when i reach there
1	The nurse who took my blood was the wife of the man who was terminated in the company i m working in 1
1	Do you think I ’m in risk if the nurse picks up the other needle or maybe if that other needle was used to someone else
1	In your expert opinion do you think I need to forget about this thing and move on or I need to be get tested
1	I ’m thinking the reason she ask me not to look during blood extractions was because she will get her own blood and wants to transmit diseases on me
1	Do you think I have a reason to be paranoid for this case
1	Reply The Dr prescribe me with meds for my palpitation and palpitationPrex 75 mg pregabalin and inderal propranololif you can give meds or advise for to remove my phobia so my palpitation will goneplease

1	I was smoking about 10 cigs a day for 14 years
1	But , my lung functions in 2 different tests were   9095
1	Recently for last month or so , I am feeling lot dizzy and get frequent numbness in legs , hands , head
1	Went to emergency and they did CT scan of head but could not find anything bad
1	Should I wait for a couple of months and see if that goes away on its own
1	I was very healthy until last March and now I am never the same again
1	I am a 17 year old male currently a Junior in High School
1	I have a job a Burger King at the moment , I am so lost right now , my grades have slipped up really bad ever since freshmen year
1	I feel like I ca nt make it , I want to attend college and make something of myself but I do nt feel like I have any help at all
1	I am living with my grandmother   3 Years , I do nt really know my father have nt seen him since I was around the age of 5
1	My mom has chosen some bad decesions in her life , and is nt in my life anymore
1	I have spoken with my school councilor about a plan so I can go to college , and what I need to do , I have to retake 7
1	Classes Online , so I can have a good enough GPA to get in , I am also doing horrible at the moment in my Junior year
1	I am not dumb or stupid at all , its just I have had so much stress in my life the past couple years I ca nt see me having a bright future anymore
1	To add on to all of this my grandmother has been hounding me about money for my cellphone bill , insurance bill , I have to get a car soon , I owe her 350 dollars , she always tells me I need to learn how to get my   together , and budget my small paycheck from Burger King
1	I am extremely behind in my school , which I need to have caught up , I have bills to pay , I have a job , I have a really divided family , I have become non social with alot of people
1	I do nt really have alot of great friends in my life at the moment , I do nt go anywhere , I just need someones
1	My new friend and hopefully girl friend has been through similar things , and tells me to just stay postive , but I just ca nt
1	She is the only thing that I am actually happy about
1	She s a senior and will be leaving soon so I do nt know what to do
1	My grandma is complaining about bills to me , behind in grades , family issues , I just do nt know what to do anymore
1	Maybe somone here can give me some good advice , and help me out with some postive ideas
1	After having had a hysteroscopy which found ' no serious problems ' , but did show some Atrophy , I 've been prescribed Vagifem 25mcg pessaries
1	I 've started using them but was concerned to find on reading the patient leaflet that these are HRT and I 'm wary about the risks
1	I 'm 61 and have been postmenopause with no menopausal problems for several years
1	As I do n't have any of the troublesome symptoms of vaginal itching , burning , soreness , dryness , which it seems are the usual reasons for using these pessaries , I wonder if the risk of using them is worth it
1	I 've also found on the internet that the 25mcg has been discontinued in the US I 'm in the UK and that only Vagifem of 10mcgs strength are now used there
1	I rang the hospital to try to speak about this to the prescriber but was told by the gyno 's secretary that I would have to ask my GP
1	I 'm now waiting for a GP appointment and using the pessaries meanwhile , but I wondered if anyone on the forum has experiences of them
1	i have a long distance relationship with my girlfriend , we 've connected emotionally like nothing i 've ever known , a few months ago she revealed to me that she 's been sexually abused by her father and despite her best control and refusals time and again he manipulates her back into that position again , i do n't consider it cheating because of the circumstances and i do everything i can to support her through it and get her out of it but she wo n't get help or let me go to the authorities on her behalf because she 's afraid of the damage it would do to her family , i suspect her mother is already suspicious of what s happened but has no proof , she was asked once by her mum about it and she denied what s happened out of habit , i 'm the first and only person she 's ever told and i 'm doing everything i can to support her but i 'm having difficulty coping , if it was just helping her deal with her past it would n't be so bad but with the fact it 's an on going thing that she ca n't get him to stop and she thinks wo n't stop until she leaves home it 's difficult
1	also is the fact i want to get along with her family because they dislike and mistrust me but my anger and hatred towards her father makes it all the more difficult , how do i help break her of this vicious cycle without destroying her family and how do i keep my mind whilst doing it , i love her more than anything but every day coping with the distance and this makes it harder and harder
1	well i have this problem ever since i was a kid but its getting worse with age i m 21 now
1	when i was little i used to be more active in my head as in i used to think alot about life fantacies or making plans etc n because of this i think i m unable to read for more then few mins n its really hard to keep working on something without thinking about it or something n hearing my own voice in my head talking about the things i m thinking and even when i m in class or watching something on tv or even while driving n i get so involve in it that physically i pause n i pause n my auto pilot thing takes over n thn my body do its work on its own but it mostly just screw up coz thn i do things like i used to do it or how i mostly do it
1	n once we were in a class n i was trying to focus but in head i was planning on how to deal with that topic n how i m gona work on it when i will get home etc n i kept going for like an hour n thn my teacher called out my name n said r u listening to me n i said yes
1	he thn told me to come to his table n asked me i know u get bored in my class right coz u think u do nt need it n while he was talking i started thinking again n i did nt knw what he said to me he thn again said r u listening to me
1	n i said yes n thn he said ok thn tell me what is the last thing i was talking to u about n i said u said r u listening to me n he said no b4 that n i did nt know what he was saying so i just stood there n thn he started saying that most of the students r physically here but there minds r somewhere else n thn i started thinking about something n again he said AHMED
1	n thn he made a really bad face n told me to go n sit down   n its not like i do nt try to focus on things i do try n sometimes i try so hard that i do nt get the whole thing i m reading or listening n because of that focus my head starts hurting so bad   n i do this while driving n in my auto pilot mode i kept driving n thn when i focus around me sometimes i m way out of my route n i do nt remember at that point that how did i get there n i do this while walking talking etc n its getting really bad   n once i came home n normally i go to my room put my things on my desk n lay down in my bed but i start thinking at that point n when i regained my sense i was in my car n i was backing my car n my clothes were changed n my cell n wallet were in my pocket n everything was in place except for i did nt want to go anywhere n i had no idea what was i doing there   so i went back to my room n i guess u guys get the main idea that how bad is this thing n this phase of thinking can b really long or short like from few seconds to mind to HOURS
1	n while i m in this phase my basic instinct kick in n my body start to do work on auto pilot mode
1	n SOMETIMES while thinking about one thinking like may b working on some project n thinking about it n thn randomly i start thinking about something else n one thing lead to another n thn i forget that what i was thinking about in the first place n thn i retrace my steps n it takes a really long time mostly n thn when finally i figure out all of it thn i get back to my original work
1	i m REALLY tired of this thing n idk if its coz of something or is it normal idk but i really wana get rid of it coz its getting bad
1	i have never told anyone this coz they will think i m making this up or i m a dumb person coz many characters in tv shows or movies do these kinda things but they r stupid n i know i m not stupid coz my iq is really high so PLS if anyone know what is this n how can i fix it thn do tell me coz i wana do my work without this thing distracting me n i wana read like normal people
1	my head is just a mixture of an ocean of imagination n while writing this i got distracted by this thing atleast 6 7 times n sometimes i lost it that what i was gona write next LOL anyway i m waiting for ur answers TC ps i do nt wana tell u guys this coz i do nt want u to consider these things coz it could through u off but still i m suffering from borderline personality disorder n clinical depression but pls also try to think of something without considering these 2 things bye
1	I am a 25 year old healthy male
1	I had a very traumatic experience about two years ago with a scare with hepatits C it caused a lot of stress in my life
1	Long story short I started developing these pains in my hands and feet and now can be all over at times
1	I am not very sexually active only one unprotected partner in the past two years of unknown status
1	I have been an athlete all my life thought maybe my body was breakingn down a bit or something but I doubt that at my age
1	Thank you for your time and help
1	Hi , i m a 19 year old girl , a type of person who loves to mingle with everyone , meet new friends and attend rave parties
1	But suddenly it all   up like my grades went down i ve become an irregular student in college which means more effin years till i graduate
1	I do nt know i seemed lost
1	I lost focus at everything like i do nt know what to do with my lifeI feel so alone that s why i m trying to fit with everyone else
1	Maybe it all started out when i knew i was adopted when i was like 14
1	I was pressured by the idea that i was adopted like everyone my relatives know it while i do nt it pressures me in a way that i must be that good girl who must be good at school have a good job
1	I have the idea that i want to prove that i am worth it to my parents that s why i went for engineering for college
1	But because of all this pressure in my mind it seems that i do nt know what to do
1	Things have changed lately i became unsociable no more parties no more jammings and its like i do nt have interest in school at all like i m absent most of the time and just lay on my bed and be alone
1	And i get tired of getting along with everyone like i want to be alone
1	I have loving parents and i know they will do everything for me but i just feel different from everyone now
1	And i never attempted to commit suicide or whatever it sounds stupid its like it will not solve any of your problems
1	Now my question is what will i do
1	How will i cope up and motivate myself to go on with my life
1	And should i stay away from my college friendsfor my sake
1	Becaude i think its diffrnt from my friends back in highschool
1	They do nt care at all like they are there only for good times , they are the people i ve been with in my college years should i be alone and focus in my studies
1	Today i have been to doctor , Some days before i was over smart or was that my necessity i that i left one medicine and told to doctor today
1	I was scaring he may be angry but he didnot but still I know i am not well
1	better directly say it never cures keep medicine forever , I never saw anybody get rid of it , May be for some days or some month ok , Poision regrows
1	I will be automatically disconnected with medicines cause i ca nt afford it and everest will pop up again
1	I read others some are mental from 7 years old , 11 years old , some taking medicine till 20 years , my brother is also taking
1	sujects used to come , differet god thinking this that used to come , first i used to live in city , i escaped outside city because i felt hard on paranoid later i felt angry and loved it
1	Its like daily life , I go to city sit at coffee shop , and paranoid , but it also on and off , But symotons are same ,
1	But i even do nt know something has confused me and reducing medicine is just a confusiong or real working , But when i reduced medicine from 200 mg to 100 there was so much huge communication happened
1	Or i should do more communication , Communication is something like too much thinking , too much repeating , blowing in thoughts , and that makes mind exercise
1	There is another difference betweeen past and present that when i reduce medicine from 200 mg to 100 mg that time when i reached at home , a very strong and power wave used to move on my head and that used to move my body very very voilently i was like a frog whole night very scary
1	And when wave strength it high it make me feel somebody putting a very heavy stone over my head
1	if i have purchasing power i will be taking it and will be chef will be educated more
1	BY taking medicine i was fine i was manager either every thing was smooth
1	I 'm Jana
1	I am overemotional and have cryinglaughingangrylonelyhyperexhausted bouts in an average day wo medication
1	I am currently taking Wellbutrin and paxil so the daily emotional tangents are much lesser
1	But I find it very hard to cope with stress no matter how many times i try to tell my brain to slow down and assess situations reasonably
1	So living my life this way , it was a year ago that I developed this problem with facial pain during stress
1	Yes , when I feel sudden , acute stress that carries on for more than an hour or so , my actual cheek BONES feel sore on the inside , under the skin
1	I am not taking about the undereye bags , this is lower , closer to the bottom of my cheekbone area
1	They look like I just suddenly developed two wrinkle lines through the middle both my cheeks
1	The thing is , once the stressor is gone or dealt with and I return to normal emotional levels , the pain dissipates in my cheekbones and these lines fade some , and then completely after a day , sometimes two days , until the next time I feel extremely stressed , and the process begins again
1	I have not found ANYTHING online about this kind of thing , and it is absurd to me , and frustrating as well
1	A little more medical information about me I have chronic knee pain that gets worse after sitting to long , being up and about to long , when i m cold , and when I 'm stressed
1	It started when I was 19
1	They also creak , crack , pop and feel grindy when you touch them and move the knee up and down
1	I am 22 years old
1	Hi , I am suffering from my loved one 's illness
1	I feel guilty and I am not sure why I have n't gotten divorced and stop talking to him and the other people
1	I think I love them
1	In otherwords , life is not fun because these people are always ill and extremely hard to deal with , I am constantly getting evicted and have major problems feeling anger which seem to transgress from the Borderline personality disorders my partner suffers from or his seizures
1	He was hospitalized and went into numerous seizures and each doctor we see gives him something and nothing is working
1	He acts in rages and gets upset over name calling which he starts
1	It is so upsetting that I cry alot because what are my neighbors thinking
1	I know mental illness is everywhere but he is a true nutjob , I am so tired of these unpredicable episodes
1	I can not live like this anymore , I ca n't relax , I thought he would improve but I am finding he is truely getting worse and I am feeling sick from the constant burden of trying to figure all of this out
1	I have had enough but he calls my friends , jobs , everyone I could get help from and lies to them creating a really worse story
1	He twists all of our arguements into true lies
1	I finally got him to the emergency room and he got on lexapro which was working but now he is worse again
1	Usually , he feels bad for others but he says he feels bad about his self , and this is a change
1	I hate him right now but just writing this email makes me feel better because I am starting to see there may be a way out because he is a sick man
1	My husband is getting worse , throwing things and making our home which we are losing a really bad place for our neighbors and myself
1	I 've been in and out of the hospital with him 36 times within a year
1	It looks like his eyes are dialated again which makes me feel he could be taking something behind my back another VA bad prescription , or is seizing again
1	We are under stress , but the day to day life activities of functioning in NYC seem to be too much for him
1	HE is driving me to have anxiety and I started taking something which I do n't need makes me forgetful and slow
1	I am afraid to leave him alone but every saturday night turns into a fight
1	The medications are making him less careful slamming things and he is not careful if I get hurt , so I think he is become like a monster more and more
1	Luckily I am not hurt but can this medication escalate his moods so that he hurts someone or himself , he may be taking too much and his behavior mood changes are getting worse
1	Just this year I broke up with my partner of 8 years who abused me
1	I saw a couple of counselors during my very low times
1	While seeing each of them it was suggested that I also go to Al Anon
1	I am now away from my former partner and with another woman who is not at all an abuser of alcohol , drugs , or me
1	I have a lot of work to do for myself and we both know that
1	She would like to see me go to Weave for therapy since they specialize in abuse towards women
1	I agree , but I do n't have the money to pay for any counseling services at all and do n't have insurance either
1	When I have suggested going to Al Anon , she kind of lectures me about why I should n't because I am no longer in a relationship with an alcoholic
1	When I try to explain that I have developed behaviors that are specific to spouses of alcoholics , she still does n't get it and I 'm not good and explaining it because I am such a coward
1	My mind goes blank , I fill with fear , and then I say ok , agree , or do anything to get out of the conversation
1	Am I right in wanting to go to Al Anon or is a waste of my time
1	If I should go , what do I say to explain that I am still a victim of my old behavior
1	I want to talk to her so that she hears me , but I am so afraid of being wrong while I 'm trying to explain something I think is right
1	I feel like in the end , she is probably right because her life is on track
1	Mine is n't so obviously the choices and way I think must be wrong
1	Just writing this , I see how I sound
1	Okay so it 's been two days since it happen That guy that I was dating for 13 months left me march 9 th and he left me for my friends and needless to say she is no longer my friend and on April fools day he sent me a text message sayingHey I have something I really wanna tell you
1	I miss you and really want us to be together and everything back to how it 's support to be or at least was
1	When I was with you I felt like my life was perfect , like I had everything I ever wanted and needed Now that we are not together I feel empty and like I 'm missing something and I realized that it was you
1	When we split up I lost a part of me , a part of my heart and I really wish i waswith you and that i could call you mine and that it was me standing next to you holding your hand knowing that you will be there beside me whenever I need you Then I was so confused and lost and I did n't know what to say and then after like five minutes he said Haha april fools you thought you know i do nt want you back and I 'm happy with my new gf and I do n't need you any more NOw I do n't know what to do I ca n't stop thinking about how that made me feel and I do n't know what to do I ca n't stop crying it 's like this no one knows how I feel about this not even my best friend I ca n't talk to her because all she ever says is I never liked him anyways you do n't need him I do n't want to hear about it any more so I feel so alone about all of this it 's really depressing and all so I need someone 's help

1	My ex gf has been investigated by CPS in the last 3 years I believe 13 times now for neglect , sexual abuse allegations against male roommates in her household , and child abuse
1	I am now fighting for primary care of my son since the last 3 investigations regarding abuse , and neglect involve my son
1	I have found that CPS has closed previous reports with no indicators because they could not keep up with my ex 's many moves 6 times in 3 months
1	My son is now having serious nightmare since the court has ordered 5050 time sharing and my son is being taken out of state for 2 weeks every month
1	Her new boyfriend has been arrested for simple battery with family violence , hindering a 911 call , and criminal trespass and lives in the home with my ex
1	My son tells me this man spanks him and that he is bad
1	I have now been in contact with many of my ex 's previous neighbors that have agreed to testify to the neglect , and of the abuse they witnessed on the children by her previous boyfriends , but since the case has been closed with no indicators how do I insist that something be done
1	The neighbors state they spoke with CPS and told the investigator of the horrible living conditions my sons playpen was in the master bedroom closet and this is where he slept , animal and human feces on the floor , more than 40 bags of garbage stored in the home that was removed when she was evicted again for non payment , lived without electricity and water for weeks , the neglectmy 2 year old son outside alone for more than 15 minutes at a time wearing just a diaper , children begging for food , children inappropriately dressed for cold weather , as well as the abuseboyfriend choke slamming son on a bed after he he hit his sister , being smacked in the back of the head on many occasions , being left with whoever for 5 out of 7 days of time sharing with no contact with the kids and CPS never documented any of these statements
1	I also wanted to mention even after taking my son to the E R for a black eye , what appeared to be a belt strap mark on his inner upper arm like he was blocking his face , and serious bruising the nurse called CPS and I have found now that they never involved the police
1	I am fearful that with her past bad decisions and continuing to make the same decisions were her boyfriends are concerned that my son is going to end up being severely hurt or maybe even worse
1	How do I get the case reopened or get their attention before it 's too late for my son or maybe one of his siblings
1	So me and my ex of three years broke up a week before Christmas
1	We had been fighting so much and he said he was broken
1	He told me he did n't think we would get back together and said to see how this goes though
1	Everything was fine until I found out he was going outof state to spend new years and I got really upset and he promised me he would spend new years with me
1	He hugged me and held me too and said he was sorry that he did n't realize it would upset me so much
1	After Christmas , I got him a really nice pair of headphones and he got me some nice things we were still okay
1	2 days after Christmas though he started acting strange and would n't really talk
1	I got him to bring me a movie a needed , but he brought over more then that
1	He brought over all my stuff
1	Well I was sitting in the car talking to him and asked if we were still doing new years and he said no , that it was for the best and he was going to go ahead outof state
1	I started crying and just went through such an emotion of betrayal that I started slapping him and screaming
1	He has put me through stuff like this beforeI felt like it was my breaking point
1	I started telling him I hated him and when I finally got out of the car I started kicking it and telling him to   leave and never come back
1	He seemed so scared , and I had never done that before
1	I feel like such an idiot , I really do
1	I sent him email tonight telling him I am sorry and that I felt bad to the bottom of mmy heart
1	I feel like I ca nt forgive myself though
1	Do you think over time that he may want to see me again and continue being friends , or did I hurt him and scare him too much
1	If I pick up the pieces , show I am doing okay , do you think it would be safe to confront him one day and tell him I am sorry face to face
1	I picked up running again to help with the pain and I quit smoking , something he hated
1	I ca n't sleep at night and feel like major crap
1	How can I get him to trust me again and talked to me
1	Hi Everyone , I 'm wondering if anyone can shed some light on my situation
1	I am 27 , and in December of 2010 , upon returning from vacation , I got sick with a cold
1	It lasted about a week , but then I got severe constipation and went to the doctor
1	I upped my fibre intake , and the constipation turned to diarrhea
1	My stomach issues were persisting , and I started cutting out certain foods
1	I had one instance of blood in my stool , which led me to believe it was colon cancer
1	I started to also get severe dizziness , which my doctor attributed to the fact that I had just returned from a cruise
1	She suggested I wait it out , which I did
1	The glands in my neck got really swollen and painful , but I had no sore throat
1	I changed my glasses four times in a period of a month
1	I asked to see an ENT , who told me I had bad acid reflux although i never had heartburn
1	He said it was so bad , it was going into my nasal passages
1	He put me on Tecta twice a day , and most of my facial symptoms went away
1	It was CONSTANT twitching , all over my body
1	I started thinking that I had ALS or MS My eyes had gotten better at this point , with the occasional sharp pain in the eye happening once in a while
1	I should also mention that throughout all this , I was also getting random nerve pains all over my body , and a heat sensation on my scalp
1	The twitching was persistent , and I was scared to death of ALS
1	It happened in my jaw , my neck , my arms and my legs
1	I went to the doctor crying my eyes out , and she did a series of muscle strength tests which she said were normal
1	She sent me to a rhumatologist who essentially did the same thing , also normal
1	both my family doctor and the rhumatologist did blood work on me
1	The rhumatologist also tested me for some markers which are not typically tested , and she said everything was normal
1	However I started getting this buzzing sensation in my feet
1	It would first happen at the heel of my right foot , but then it started on the top of my left foot
1	a week later , i felt it in my left knee
1	Another odd sensation i am feeling is heat in my legs , and also the sensation that i have worked my legs really hard at the gym but i have nt
1	i can still walk on them , and i can walk on my tippie toes and all thatbut its really hard to sleep at night with the heat feeling , and the pain
1	I am scheduled for a brain MRI on the 19th , and EMG testing on the 30th
1	My doctor thinks it is stress , and has prescribed me with Cipralex
1	I have nt taken it yet , as i 'm unsure if it will help
1	I have done a Gastroscopy , which has come back normal
1	I was on Effexor for 7 years and was finally able to come out of it about 15 months ago
1	I tried stopping it before by taking it every other day , but the dizziness and other withdrawal effects were so terrible , I had to stay on the minimum doze for about 2 years
1	After doing some research and pressuring my doctor to find a way out , he finally prescribed a 10x10 tapering kit very effective
1	where a lab customizes the dose for you and remove 10 of it every week for 10 weeks
1	The last weeks were the most difficult I felt super emotional and very tired
1	I had never felt so tired in my life and became extremely emotional
1	Fortunately I have a very good naturopath and a great psychologist that have helped me a lot
1	The naturopath did a hormone test and found my adrenals working “ overtime ” that explained my tiredness and prescribed a few supplements St John ’s worth , fish oil , B6 , skullcap and 5HTP
1	Slowly , I ’ve been regaining my strength and no longer feel as tired
1	However , I ’m still quite sensitive and have short periods of sadness that take me back me of my former episodes of depression
1	Both my doctor and my therapist often remind me that these episodes are much shorter and that is not the same
1	However , my poor boyfriend who ’s been a sweetheart during this process often pays for my moments of anger and my extreme sensitiveness , and I ’m often catch myself afraid of pushing him away from me the relationship is sort of new
1	My therapist says that the withdrawal effects are about 3 months , but that everyone is different , so this may vary
1	Also , I do n’t want to blame everything I do on my withdrawal process and try to keep myself in check as much as I can
1	I try to keep myself active , by running for short periods of time , dancing , meditating or doing yoga , but the fear of being depressed again or losing my relationship still haunts me
1	I ’ve been exploring other forums , but most of them focus on the reactions while getting off the medication and do n’t say much about what happens after you are totally off
1	I had a occupational injury 7 months ago , I have been on wcomp for 4 months now
1	I finally had surgery 12 days ago
1	I was in a walking bot for 5 months and now with a triple subtlatr joint fusion with ligament repair I am unable to walk and recovery will be close to a good 812 months
1	ANYWAYS the entire experience with Wcomp and a awful HR deptcompany I work for has made my experience awful to say the least
1	I have Noticed a SUDDEN shift in myself I CANT or Do nt sleep well
1	I CANT eat or have little to No appetite I have nausa 80 of the time and feel not blah but can pin point it
1	I shower at night right before my spouce comes home , and am in Pj 's all the time
1	Now his part may be due to what is easiest with my mobility the shower Pj thing
1	I was on a 2 low dose pain meds for the 1st week
1	I ca nt describe how I feel , I do nt have any random or scary thoughts but I KOWN this is not normal for me and I do nt like it at all
1	I think that my entire injurywcomp ordeal may be the key
1	I think my anxietydepression problem stems around my relationship with my boyfriend
1	I am starting to think he is bipolar
1	He verbally abuses me on a regular basis
1	He makes me feel so low , I cry for a couple days after a fight
1	He has called me a idiot , loser , crazy and that I have to earn his respect whenever I try and defend myself he gets in this rage and the insults start
1	Here is a example of a argument we recently got a new Mainecoon kitten , I was trying to get him to look at him play , my boyfriend roles his eyes says he is too busy because he is getting ready for Burning Man may I add at the last minute , then I get upset and confront him about it , then he goes into this rampant rage
1	He grabs my arm so hard it made a bruise and then he knocks his knuckles on my head
1	He blames me for everything , if something goes wrong its my fault
1	May I add I have never insulted him once
1	Later when he calms down he seems to regret what he did and he starts being very nice
1	He is also very hyper sexual , I am started to think he is just using me as a object
1	I am just so confused , I hate living at home with my parents , I do n't meet or connect with people easily , the only kind of people I seem to connect with are ones with mental or emotional problems , its like I would rather be abused by my boyfriend than move back home and be stuck in my room alone
1	i am a college student and under tremendous stress and have been for the past month
1	since then , i have had this weird feeling that i am not real and that i am not controlling my actions , but yet i know i am
1	i know i am real and i realize i feel strange
1	i can go through a day normally , but when i am by myself sometimes and alot of times at night i do nt feel like i am real
1	i have felt this feeling before in my life , but just for like one day at a time
1	i am away at school and do nt feel real when i am here
1	but when i go home and i am in my comfortable home environment i feel normal
1	let me give you some background
1	i am a sophomore in college and something really bad happened to my friends and i the summer after high school
1	i was in the last car with my boyfriend
1	in front of my eyes , his car spun three times and was on fire
1	i remember this like it was yesterday and i never actually got over it and dealt with it
1	i never let myself think about it because i was toobusy , my first year at college and the thoughts just made me sad
1	i am scared that never letting myself recover from this is why i feel so weird and i do nt know if i need to get help
1	i am also very stressed now so that could also be a reason for why i feel the way i do
1	I 'm a middle schOol preteen and I think I have depressionI've been cutting myself just to feel something I want to die so bad my family goes to church and learns about god
1	I keep thinking hell ca n't be as bad as life is nowI think my depression started when I was in the 5th grade I got into a big fight with a friend and I started to cut myself later on the depression lessens but soon when I hit summer it grew back because my family was going through troublesmy siblings hate meI do n't feel safeschool is suffocatin me my mom yells at me 247 my dad died a few weeks before the depression started I feel like I 'm locked in a cage and I ca n't get out , everyday trying to convince myself that I 'm not apart of this world
1	I want to die I m cutting so much nowit hurts less and less and I 'm doing it more oftenI might as well bleed myself to deathI only have this 1 friend who understands me and listens to meI have other friends but I 'm not truthful to them they ca nt c through meI just want to die I hate life so muchhelp me Please pleaseif I decide to die I 'm going to make sure the world hates me so that no one will miss me
1	I want to die I feel hopeless   please someone help me
1	So my boyfriend and I have known each other for 6 years   been together for a year and a half
1	Since we 've been officially dating he 's really done nothing but hurt me and I know it 's my fault that I stay and put myself thru it but he 's literally a psycho
1	He cheated on me twice that I knew about and confronted him and I catch him talking to or texting other girls all the time but every time I try to leave he goes nuts
1	Says he ca n't live without me , brings our unborn child into it , threatens to stalk me , attempts to hold me hostage til I change my mind about leaving , he will even get violent and try to hold me down or choke me when I 'm not giving in to staying with him so normally I just do bc I am scared
1	We just got into a bad fight bc I found out more of his dirty secrets
1	I 'm bruised up , scratched up , a blood vessel popped in my eye and he even hit my stomach
1	I had to beg and plead and cause a scene nearly getting the police involved just for him to take me home
1	I 'm safe now and he 's at work , but I really want to talk to his mom to see if she can just get him to leave me alone
1	I 've gotten really close with his family but Idk if that is the right thing to do
1	I just know he will try to make me look like the bad person and he will try to play the victim when all I 'm trying to do is protect myself and my son

1	Hi I married 15 yrs ago
1	After marriage I left my job , career , home and went abroad as he was having a job there
1	After marriage I got to know he is a very different kind of person
1	He does n't respects any one , he has a very proudly behaviour that he is earning so much and is educated
1	After marriage he started making me feel that I am dependent on him , he never appreciated me in any terms , his parents never liked me as they expected a lot of dowry which my family should give   bfr marriage my mother made it clear she ca n't give dowry at that time there family behaved like they only want girl which their son liked and no issue of money
1	With time passed fights between me   my husband increased on sex , on maintainence , on lifestyle , on choices etc and as I want dependent on him I have to listen to him
1	On every time if I ask for my basic needs also he used to call my mother and say your daughter is demanding a slipper , a lip gloss etc
1	My mother in law always supported his son saying to me that its female who have to adjust in new family
1	Now my husband has started saying he was n't interested in this marriage and it was me who emotionally black mailed him
1	Whenever we come in contact with my in laws we have fights and issues , my husband blindly trust on them and even reveals our bedroom secrets in front of her
1	In July ' 15 I decided to stay back in my home country and do n't go with him and have started searching and applying for jobs
1	My family is too much worried as my husband does n't even talks properly with my mother
1	His family has cut off all connections with me saying its a husband wife issue and no one will interfere in that
1	He does n't have any regrets of fighting and insulting me in front of any body
1	He always claimed he never enjoyed me as the rhythm which he can make with his hand can not be made directly
1	He also claims he has been practicing musturbation since Hus age 16 so he has the capability of controlling his ejaculation but that frustrates me as he is n't able to ejaculate even a single time in my vagina which makes me feel good
1	I had a horrible panic attack the other night as I started thinking about my future
1	I 'm a premed freshman in college and I 'm terrified I 'm making the wrong choice as a career path and will regret it
1	I have a hard time making friends and so I have no one to talk to but my mom
1	Anyways , I told my mom about my panic attack and she did n't really engage me in any conversation
1	When I told her that her constant lack of interest in anything I say makes me feel hurt and insignificant she got very angry and started shouting
1	She said it was because I was being stupid
1	She said she 's sick of me always complaining and that she 's sick of my constant depression
1	She said she does n't care about my problems and that they are trivial
1	She said she buys me everything I could want so I have no right to be so depressed
1	She also said that unfortunately she ended up with a kid with issues
1	My father agrees with her
1	So I am upset and though I do n't feel anger or hate towards her , I do n't think I can go back to our relationship
1	I know she has her own problems and stress but I ca n't help but feel betrayed and a little scared
1	Scared that now I have no one to rely on for emotional support but myself as I try to fight my depression
1	I 'm afraid this is never going to go away and everyone is sick of me
1	Hi , Just signed up to this because I am in a situation I am not coping well with and I do n't have anyone in a similar situation to ask for advice from or can relate
1	My girlfriend and I are both divorces , I have 2 children of my own aged 7 and 9 both girls who come and live with me and my girlfriend every weekend
1	My girlfriend of 3 years has 2 children from previous relationships aged 17 girl and 22boy who live with us full time
1	We bought a house together a year ago
1	I do n't get on with her son at all where all communication has broken down completely now
1	He is very difficult to get along with as we think he has autism
1	He is a little boy trapped in a mans body although he smokes , drinks and is constantly going from girlfriend to girlfriend
1	He works for a gypsy for £ 30 a day cash in hand 4 days a week
1	He does n't acknowledge my children at all , Does n't get involved in any family things and does not really seem to accept the whole 2 families becoming 1 scenario
1	I Ca n't talk to my girlfriend as we end up rowing about him because she gets defensive just me mentioning his name
1	As his mother I can see her wanting to support her son but I feel I do n't have her support and I am lost
1	I Love her and I accept she has children and I have no issues with her daughter and she is fantastic with my kids
1	She wants to get married and although I want too this issue with me and her son has stopped me from proposing
1	Hi , This is the first time I am seeking help online , and I am really thankful to the people who will take the time to read this
1	I 've been struggling with depression for a year now , with many ups and downs , mainly due to anxiety , not knowing what to do with my life , feeling utterly lost and crushed by the sense that everything is meaningless
1	I have been quite an overachiever during my childhood and teenage years , always highest grades in my class and graduating from hs with the highest grades in my school etc
1	I then applied for a Medical School I 'm from Europe , where unlike in the US , it is possible to begin medical studies right after hs in some countries
1	But I soon began to realize that it was n't what I wanted to do even though I still do n't know what I want to do
1	And it 's a demanding career , am I ready to spend 912 years of my life studying something I do n't really like
1	The thing is , my mother brought me up as a single parent
1	My parents got a nasty divorce when I was 2 or 3
1	My mother remarried when I was 6 but her husband cheated on her and they divorced 1 year later
1	Following this , we suffered from some financial difficulties from when I was 7 to when I was 14
1	I only met my father once or twice he lives in a different country so I do n't really know him , but my mother often told me when I was younger that he never loved her , treated her badly no physical violence , disrespected her
1	But I think there must be things she 's not telling me because the amount of anger she has toward him , it 's insane
1	I 've been trying to come to terms with it but I still find myself resenting her for taking it out on me She has the habit of calling me names and being really mean with me whenever I display a personality trait I supposedly have in common with my father
1	As you can see , my mother did n't have a very happy life , and she always told me that her biggest wish was to see me succeed in life
1	So I guess that could be where the overachiever part of me comes from
1	She was also emotionally dependent on me and suffers from mild paranoia and hypochondria
1	Most of the times , I had to act like the adult in our relationship
1	All in all , I had always tried to be a good daughter to her , seeing as how she had been so unlucky in her life
1	That 's why even though the field of study I had chosen was n't really to my liking , I still tried to make an effort
1	Because she was so happy and proud when I chose the medical field
1	And then , came the burnout A part of my mind was always saying ' What are you doing
1	You surely ca n't be thinking of doing this your whole life '
1	but I always tried to push harder , thinking that maybe if I kept it up I would get used to it eventually
1	I was living in dorms and I began skipping more and more classes , my grades began to drop … I was feeling tired all the time , could n't get out of bed , could n't stay awake more than 2 hours without crying
1	By the time I realized what was happening I was already in too deep
1	I did n't want to see the disappointment on her face
1	I did n't want to be another source of unhappiness in her life , even thought I know I already was , because I am the daughter of my father , and she made it clear that I always reminded her of him
1	Eventually , I had to move back with her and it 's been hell ever since
1	I really need someone I can talk to because I just feel so lost
1	I know I can be disagreeable when I am anxious or sad but she feels “ assaulted ” whenever I say something , even if it 's only “ Have you seen the keys ”
1	And if she 's not pleased by what I say , she either ignores me or lashes out completely , there 's no in between
1	I ca n't tell you how frustrating it is when you ask for help and you just wanna talk to the one adult who you think knows you enough to give you the appropriate counsel and you just find yourself talking to a wall
1	When I prompt her for an answer she becomes completely hysterical She shouts , cries , throw and break things , and all hope of conversation is gone
1	I 've had thoughts of killing myself more than once but I ca n't do it
1	We have relatives , but we are n't close with them at all and they are scattered across the world
1	I ca n't really talk to my friends because they only know the happyandoutgoingme and I was so ashamed of my failure I 've gone completely off the radar
1	I 'm planning on getting therapy soon , but it 's really really hard for me
1	I am not used to share my deepest thoughts with people
1	The thing is , I can see that my mother could use some therapy too , because she 's clearly unhappy
1	I 've tried to introduce that idea to her and she wo n't acknowledge that
1	She keeps saying that psychotherapy is for crazy people which I clearly am according to her and that she has no problem whatsoever
1	What can I say to make her consider seeing a psychiatrist
1	a year ago i was on zoloft after dislocating my shoulder and waking up with numbness in my skull   for 3 monthss it was like it til i met a chiropractor who showed me proof it was my c1 and he cracked my neck into place 3 weeks later pain was gone i was feeling 100   again   sadly i was still on zoloft i weened off them and always felt like my emotions were turned down a notch i m not as scared anymore and such i thought over time those chemicals would build back but i kept having nightmares waking up in cold sweat i was glad though to be away from that pain last monday i had a stabbing feeling in my eye after having a hard week finding out my dads cancer spread i was slouching heaps going hard with exerise but at the same time trying to do the right thing when i noticed my feeling are not showing as much as it should i should be upset or mad next day someone crashed into my car and took off without leaving a note i felt like i cracked abit but i should of been more mad then what i was   then i realised that stabbing feelings gotton worse so i went to a dr and he said it was stress strange enough i stood up straight instead of slouching and the pain vanishes   right now i have no pain but the anxiety is bad i never wanna go back to a vegetable thinking i was mentally sick when i was nt sorry if this is messy i m writing this down on a tablet
1	I am currently on Wellbutrin 150mgday
1	I just started this medication on Sunday
1	My Doctor changed me from Paxil because I had gained an ungodly amount of weight in the 6 months that I was on Paxil
1	I have also been on Cymbalta quit because it did n't do anything for me Lexapro quit becuase of sexual side effects I am having major issues with the Wellbutrin so far
1	I have cried every day , I feel helpless , lonely and like I ca n't take care of myself
1	My husband does n't help me at all
1	I feel that he has abandoned me
1	He tells me that he is not my mommy or my daddy
1	I am 30 years old and my mommy and daddy have basically abandoned me anyways so I do n't have one of those
1	I have been having panic attacks for about 2 years now
1	They are either daily or every other day
1	I sometimes have 5 minute panic attacks and sometimes 2 hour panic attacks
1	It just depends and there is nothing that starts them they just start
1	I also have some rage issues but sometimes I think it is because I am trying to get my husband 's attention and he just does n't ever say anything
1	I do n't feel loved by him and I do n't know why
1	It seems that he loves his children with everything he has but not me
1	I do n't know what is wrong with me but I thought I would post this just to see if I get any replies
1	Right now maybe bc of the meds my stomach hurts terribly and my legs ache
1	I have heartburn everyday no matter what I eat and it is very painful
1	Sometimes I feel like my brain is going to stop
1	Help or give me advice if you can
1	Hi I been in a disabling state with depression for atleast 6 months
1	Despite many things with health and what not happening in my life I have never felt into a depressive episode
1	I did have a relationship breakup and it was all going well but possibly rushing it and thinking ahead stressed me that relationship was 6 months and is now over
1	I did n't get physcosis just normal symptoms after use but I noticed a week or so later I got heaps of worry and could n't sleep etc and still find myself in same situation
1	I have tried anti depressants lexapro whic made me feel worse and I 've tried others which helped a bit but also with some side effects stopped
1	I feel thpughts improved slightly but still suffering this depression and feel there is no way out if I go out etc I get no enjoyment so I 'm pretty mch bedridden
1	I m sorry my question is not about BPD but about NPD another personality disorder its important and mental health forum is always shut
1	I really need some information and I believe it is very important
1	I am not writing here about myself but about another person a person who I believe may one day put one of my friend ’s lives in danger
1	My friend is in a relationship with her boyfriend they are both 18 and have been together for 2 years
1	He uses her like a sex doll he ’s raped her , screamed and shouted at her , thrown chairs around but never hit her he has also cheated on her many times
1	He abuses her emotionally and sexually as well as physically but to an unknown extent
1	He shows extreme signs of an exacerbated narcissistic personality disorder , he has to control every single aspect of her life , assert his power over her in every conceivable way , he has such a strong desire for power over her its unbelievable
1	In addition he is very socially withdrawn and does not socialize at all outside of his one or two ' ' friends '' which is commonly a underlying characteristic in these kinds of cases
1	One thing that I find quite worrying is that i ve suspected he has a severely narcissistic personality disorder of some kind for quite some time now
1	I have ' ' known '' him for 8 years we were never friends
1	He seems to be devoid of any signs of empathy or remorse and even to some extent you could argue fear as well
1	I do n’t want to go as far as to say sociopathy I know its a very debated subject with many scientists believing due to the nature of in some cases the sufferers being unable to feel emotions leading to the desires of rape and murder etc
1	I ve never believed it is that serious but what I am trying to say is that he seems to be bordering on many of the signs
1	I guess I wish to find out if there is anything documented that is similar to what I have discussed but not to the extreme extent of actual sociopathy because I believe he overlaps the diagnosis of NPD by quite considerable margin
1	Thank you for your time
1	I have been married for nearly 20 years and have three children aged 11 , 13 and 16
1	My husband is my best friend and a lovely , kind , successful person
1	However , for years I have kept the secret that I do n't find him physically attractive at all
1	I can see that he is handsome , and he is slim and fit , but I ca n't make myself feel desire for him
1	I knew this when I married him but I was very young and he was so in love with me , experienced , kind and made me feel so safe , so I decided it would be fine and I would ' learn ' to love him in this way
1	It has never happened   we have sex intermittently but I often turn over and weep at the lack of intimacy   I do n't want to touch or hold him , and I ca n't bear to look him in the eyes and hold him afterwards
1	I have a desire for sex , but not for him
1	I dream desperately of meeting someone , falling in love with them and having a full , happy relationship
1	Most of the time I keep this buried   busying myself with children , house moves , career , voluntary work , caring for my terminally ill mother she died 20 months ago , seeing friends , etc
1	We have tried so hard   we had a holiday away together earlier this year without the children at a luxury beach resort   we had sex three times a day but it was so lacking in emotion , and I ended up weeping in the shower , and spending as much time as I could reading , listening to my ipod or going for a run to try and distract myself
1	After a very difficult family holiday last week , I summoned up the courage to tell him how I feel
1	I was so horrified at hurting him , but he begged me to tell him everything , so I did
1	He was gutted , devastated , but deep down he knew
1	I told him that I think he deserves someone who truly loves him , and he was so touched that I thought of him
1	We had a 4 hour conversation   no shouting   and he is so supportive
1	He understands that we should separate and we are going to live with this thought for a little while now before we tell the children and he moves out
1	I hate myself so much   I have n't slept for days   what am I doing
1	I will never find someone so kind and loving ever again , and I am 43 so who is going to want me anyway
1	If I run back to him , he will be so grateful , but that would be so unfair on him
1	This post is not only very uncomfortable for me to write but also causes me great shame but I feel I need to open up or this will kill me
1	Well I was adopted by my aunt when I was 3 months old my mother was only 14 and she left me in a crib for 3 days alone in July in winter sleeper my aunt came to visit one day back then in the 70 's no one really locked doors thank God she did n't when my aunt came in the house she heard me crying and from that day I was her daughter I was about three or four and my aunt allowed mymother to come get me omg that was a mistake things where fine at first and then one day I remember I had a younger sister that lived with my mother she was in her walker and I was really hungry my mother was preparing some food I climbed up on a chair and reach on the counter my mother had a knife in her hand cutting some carrots before I knew I had a knife through my tiny hand she did n't have any sympathy she told me to go wash my handoff in the bathroom and she was n't taking me to the hospital it was my fault to this day I still have the scar when I asked her about it when I became an adult she said she did n't remember it
1	Moving forward when i was about 10 yrs old I remember my first sexual violation with a close member of the family I remember he came for a visit and I was hanging my clothes up in my closet and he came into my room I remember feeling is breath on my neck and his hand on my breast telling me how much I grown and touching my butt he told me it was our secret this was the worst feeling I ever felt
1	My relatives trusted him so much that my lil sister and I shared a room together we had two beds and they allowed him to sleep in my sisters bed during his stay and my sister and I shared a bed she slept at the head and I slept at the foot one night he came in smelling of alcohol I pretended to be sleep I guess I was n't a good pretender because he whispered in my ear I know you 're not sleep and proceeded to pull my nightgown up and panties down and sodomized me I wish my Sister would have woke up but she did n't
1	Then when I was 12 my girl cousin started touching me and have sex with meI was so confused and the violations continued with another girl family member then a couple of boy cousins I was so afraid no one would believe I never said anything I see all these people now they have moved on in their lives and I still feel like a dirty rag
1	I really did n't know how bad I was affected until adult hood when one of my bf
1	I have struggled to cope at times with my 11 year old daughter 's behaviour and have done for quite a few years
1	she can be very aggressive , runs off slams doors screams and shouts , throws major hissy fits and has what I would call a very bad attitude and seems to have a problem with rules and boundry 's , having said that there does seem to be two side of her as she also is polite , loving and a dream to be with , she is always very popular in and out of school and as we move house alot due to husbands carrer she always make friends quickly and easily and becomes very popular quickly although things at home seem to be worse
1	we have recently placed her into boading school due to the disruption of moving and new school 's and thought with a steady routine and the stability etc would do her good and possible sort out many of the behaviour problems and that she may even apprieciate the time with us when she 's home at weekend 's and holiday 's
1	However we have been informed by the school of an unusal incident and a major hissy fit where she informed them that the reason she behaved that way is due to voices in her head , that tell her to act in that way , she also said she has said this many times in other school 's but they did not beleive her and obviously we have not been informed of this
1	I must admit that even though she has not said that to me before she has said that she ca nt help in the way she had behaved and did not know why she had behaved like she did and is alway 's very sorry and regretfull
1	I have no idea what I should do anymore and a way forward please help
1	Hey , i 'm a guy and 20 years old I get trouble with anxiety , but i 've started feeling depressed lately
1	on others ' advice , i went back for 1 more year to top it up to a full degree
1	however , i left because i did n't think it was going anywhere
1	the job i 've got is only parttime 8 hours a week
1	i asked for extra hours before Christmas but they took on christmas temps and said afterwards , i 'd be able to have extra
1	after christmas , they offered interviews to those Christmas temps   as well as me for extra hours   yet even though some of them are really bad at their job they just chat and do nt get on with it , they allowed them to stay on permanently with fulltime hours
1	i was unsuccessful based on my interview and not based on how i work so i 'm stuck with 8 hours a week
1	i always try my best in anything and I get told i work well
1	even other workmates say i 'm good and they were shocked why i did n't get extra hours even though i 've been there 2 years compared to the 2 weeks the Christmas temps had been there
1	i 've been applying elsewhere but it 's all online now no one ever emails back , i 've gone to 2 interviews in a week and i 've been unsuccessful
1	it 's for retail jobs   just to give me extra hours until i find the job i 'd love to have
1	i studied photographymedia at Uni and in the future , i would love a job in television
1	I know it 's hard to get into , but i 've set my mind to it and when i set my mind to things , i need to get there
1	I seen the top highest manager about extra hours and he said he 'd let me know , but because people are chatting about me i get anxiety that i 'm not liked by othersstupid i know but i 've had it years and i just feel really depressed because it 's like no one wants me
1	i 'm good with customers , regular customers always have a bit of a laugh with me , i will admit i can be shy , but i do n't think i 'm that bad a worker
1	people say i need to come out of my shell more
1	i 've always been confident around friends and i get told i 'm funny , but lately i 've just been feeling like doing nothing
1	like when i wake up in the morning , i used to jump out of bed
1	my Grandad , Great Nan   Great Auntie all passed away in 20102011 and I really miss them all too
1	it 's like I ca n't get it in my head that they 're no longer here
1	i wish i had the confidence in love
1	I wish i had a girlfriend
1	it feels like i want to talk with someone about it but my Doctor is useless , my family never seems to want to take me seriously either
1	I just like want a big hug and someone to tell me it 's all going to be okay
1	Me and my wife have been super happy and married for over 3 years , Our relation has been like a fairy tale where every birthday or hers or any special day I try make it as gorgeous as possible taking her wherever best I can , I ve been a heavy gamer all my life Xbox   Playstation where From the period of December to April I have had a lot of conversations with a female Whose face also I have not seen but still I did speak quite a bit while mostly all of it was about politics and games etc
1	I have mentioned in a joke that I am allergic to Condoms , 2
1	In a museum we saw dinosaurs and this girl asks me how were they and i joked saying they were naked and thirdly once I spoke of the word ' Dk ' in reference to ' Bananas ' for reasons I have no idea but I never spoke much about this to my wife , I have casually mentioned about her 23 times but not said there are times we chat online for an hour or two etc
1	  ofcourse , the above is very brief but point is I know I have done wrong   On our vacation to Italy , she went thru my phone chats , and she now is devastated , and I always have advised her in life , never ever be with a cheater , and here in this case it 's me who cheated , is there any way I can make her believe that while I was dumb during speaking to someone online , It was not a genuinly reason for me to cheat
1	I have never even had sexual discussions with the person , nor any such feelings but wife feels when I joked about allergy to condoms I was hinting at it , I do n't even know where this person lives or anything but I do understand my wrong is wrong , it 's been over 4 months now and as of last night wife has even moved out , she s been the reason for every smile or mine or every reason for me to be happy in life , can I please ask how to get her back
1	I know some of you may call me scum etc , that s fine I am , but I seriously want my wife back next to me i m willing to do anything for this but I want her back please
1	In primary school i was bullied and because of that i have found high school really difficult
1	The bullying was nt really terrible but it effected me so much more than i realise
1	I just want to cry all of the time and i just feel so sad and lonely
1	i do nt have many friends at school and the ones i have are horrible to me
1	But i have lots of best friends out of school at my church
1	However i do nt see them very often and things have changed so much that we do nt really know each other properly anymore so its not the same
1	All this and stress form exams and stuff going on at home has really been getting me down but even when i have had a really good day and things are looking up i still want to cry , but not for any reason really
1	I do nt like the way i look and i have an unusual name that everyone teases me about
1	I could never get a boyfriend in a million years either and my social life is very nearly non existent
1	And when my mom caught me crying and i said i was like that all the time she said she was a bit worried about me cause i might have depression
1	She forgot all about it but its stuck with me
1	But i thought that maybe i just wanted something to be wrong with me so that it was nt just me , so i told myself i did nt have it and that it was just in my mind
1	But one time my parents were out and i looked on the internet a i took an online test thing that asked me ten questions and i had to answer them truthfuly and i did
1	You have to answer Yes or No and i answered 7 questions Yes and it said i needed to seek medical advice
1	But i did nt really believe it so i searched for more and i did others but they all came out the same so i thought maybe i did have it
1	I wanted to tell my mom but i could nt , i do nt know why but i just could nt
1	And then i was going to tell my friend as we have been opening up to each other about our problems but i could nt tell her either
1	But i do nt want to have something wrong with me , i just want to be able to get on with my life finish high school and get on with my life , but then what if i m still going to be like this then , what if the future is nt going to be better
1	i m just really confused and i just want to know the truth about it
1	Hi , I 've never told anyone this before and it has never been mentioned by the people involved , but I have been thinking about it for years and wondering if it was normalwhen I was young i 'm not sure what age but i remember when it started I was n't old enough to feel uncomfortable about it , but I got older and gradually began to feel more and more uncomfortable my grandmother used to sit me on her knee and bounce me up and down pretending to be a horsey , while she did this she would pat my ' private ' regions which she had a special name for and repeat the name , but like in a fun happy way , as if it was a game
1	I remember the last time she did it my dad saw and he told her to stop it , I remember feeling really uncomfortable and confused about what was going on and why she was doing this
1	I still do n't understand why , I 'm really confused , do you think it was just normal silly behaviour or
1	I had quite a hard childhood aside from that living in a house full of alcoholism , domestic violence , neglect etc and always knew i had issues steming from those things , but i 've always had a problem with sex and intimacy and a feeling that I 've been repressing something , but that is the only memory I have of something happening that I think might be inappropriate
1	What do you think about that when you read it
1	I ca n't ask anyone I know because I do n't want to put it onto anyone
1	I made a post a few months back saying I believed I had depression , and I was told I was just not eating enough which I was n't
1	I began eating regularly and I still feel like I have depression
1	Summer started for me two weeks ago , and I have been avoiding everything
1	My friends have been asking me to hang out and I just do n't feel like I want to go out , and if I say yes , I eventually cancel the plans because of unknown reason
1	My motivation has really gone done , I 'm currently a young artist who draws digitally , but lately I haven them able to finish projects , or I just feel so insecure of the so far progress of it that I just close out of my art program to never see the partially finished piece again
1	And today and for the past few days actually I 've spent over 15 minutes crying because I 'm just completely sick of myself
1	I 've been thinking horrible things in my head on how to change myself , or how to please others who complain about things I do
1	I 've been so touchy with my emotions lately , so the littlest insults or anything really can push my over the ledge and make me over analyze it into something about how horrible of a person I am
1	I really just want to know if I have depression or any other things going on with me before I speak up about it to my mom
1	I have had a lot of sickness from work in the last 12 months or so and was referred to a doctor at occupational health
1	They both agree I may be suffering with a mood disorder so am now being assessed by my local mental health team
1	They need to see me over six weeks to see if my mood changes before a diagnosis can be made
1	I 'm scared they will dismiss me , as I know I need help
1	My mood is very depressed where I can barely function at times , hence sickness at work , and the next I can feel hyperactive , talk lots and feel more productive and spend money , but that not so often
1	My mood can change within hours and I 'm very irritable and angry which is not me , although I ’m not sure who I am anymore
1	I know I need help , as I ca n't cope with anything anymore and get so stressed
1	Just need advise please and do you think I will get a proper diagnosis so I can begin getting my life back and feel normal again
1	I have actually had thoughts about harming myself and even looked up ways to end it , which I have not had in the past to this degree anyway and it scares me
1	I do n't even know what I 'm asking you for , just need to vent I guess and speak to like minded people
1	I am with the love of my love life , We 've been best friends for over 20 years , we have been married going on 6 years
1	We have a son who will be 4 in April
1	We have had the worse year ever he lost his job last Jan and everything went downhill fast since then as of now we have no income at all coming in
1	I am a stay at home mom it took me 10 years to get pregnant and finally did after we stopped trying it happened 2 weeks after I graduated from collage and it was a high risk so I never went to work in my major
1	So I 've been looking for work to no avail O over the past year my husband changed and turned into someone I did n't know and I found out it was due to drugs and since I found out he has gone to detox , joined a methadone program but he 's just getting worse and I 've done my best to hide it from our son
1	The past 2 months I 've kicked him out twice but let him back because of the man he used to be and he gave me promises and his word he would stop and yes I wanted to believe him
1	But now I have told him it 's rehab or divorce
1	My question is to you guys is how do I help my son deal with his daddy leaving either way
1	All he knows is that 's my daddy , he can do no wrong , I love him , he 's my best friend
1	He is a great dad but the drugs are starting to get the best of him and he is in complete denial at this point
1	Nicole a scared mommy PS I just want what 's best for my love of my life MY SON
1	and honestly I wish the best for my husband but not here anymore
1	My bf , although he has n't been properly diagnosed , has ALL of the 9 criteria for BPD
1	All of these issues came to a head when he and i began our relationship
1	Toward the end there was verbal and even indirect physical abuse he hurt me while trying to wrestle me off of him in an attempt to get him to stop hurting himself and even choked me at one point , but the last blow out we had woke him up i think , hurting me was n't his intention , i know
1	Anyway , he checked himself into rehab immediately after that last incident and is now clean for the 1st time in 4 years and is talking rationally about his black and white thinking , abandonment issues , lack of control over his emotions , etc
1	He even took responsibility , admitting he is ill , for everything that he had previously blamed me for provoking , etc , and is going away to a psychspiritualrehab retreat for the next couple of months and claims to want to follow that up with intensive counseling and treatment
1	He told me he struggles with irrational emotions , still , of course , but is now more selfaware although in the very beginning phases , and although he wants to either hate me or smother me , he knows he loves and wants to be with me the right way , and ultimately the right thing to do is to be single while we both heal , but remain friends during the process and resume the relationship in a couplefew months
1	I see him working so hard and it makes me want to stay , I want to more than anything right now , but I 'm not sure what I 'm getting myself into
1	Is he more prone to up and leave me out of the blue one day
1	Does he really love me he claims what we had was n't really love although we have a beautiful chemistry and potential , but a manifestation of his tendencies , and he wants to do things slowly and the right way now
1	I 'm never going to allow my boundaries to be crossed again , and wo n't tolerate behaviors of the past , but I wonder if this relationship can ever be genuine andor fulfill my needs for true emotionally mature intimacy
1	And can he ever love me for , or even see who I truly am
1	He claims he does amongst all of the crying in his head , but it 's currently hard to sort through all of that
1	I have been in a relationship for 22 years married 18
1	When the kids were young , I was a stay at home mom and as a result my self esteem and self worth went down the drain
1	My husband made me feel like I was a second class citizen because I was nt bringing any   in
1	He also has a short fuse and gets cranky and angry quickly so i found myuself constatnly on egg shells trying to prevent that from happening
1	He makes promises to our kids and then does not follow through , he s passive aggressive with backhanded compliments or just outright mean to me and the kids
1	As my kids started getting older , I started working part time   but only when they were in school so that I could still care for them and not have to pay for babysitters
1	Over the years I took on more hours and now work full time and still manage the day to day functions of our household
1	I make maybe a third of what my husband makes and he constantly makes me feel again like I am a scond class citizen   that my work and the   I bring in are nowhere near as importatnt as his job and income
1	About 2 months ago he came very very close to hitting me which he has never done before in front of our kids and then told the kids that it was their fault and that if he did hit me he would have to leave and it would be their fault that we were n't together anymore he knows that if he ever hit me or had an affair   we would be done
1	I have tried multiple times to talk to him about the severity of him almost hitting me and the severity about his words afterwards but he scoffs and avoids the subject   i ca nt get past it
1	He also shows me no affection very little sex since September
1	Over the past year I have lost about 50 lbs and have gotten in shape and look pretty good for a mother of 2 in her forties   and again if he compliments me it is along the lines of you look good wow look at how saggy your   is
1	About a month ago   he used the threatening fear tactics on my 16 year old son and made him cry for fear that his dad was going to hit him
1	We never know what mood he s going to be in when he walks in the door either and when he rants and rages   we all scramble trying to difuse the situation
1	Over the years i have lost most of my friends becasue he would make me feel guilty going out with them and have been pretty isolated and alienated from my family
1	i m tired and do nt want to live like this anymore but fear that i wo nt really have any support if i leave him
1	He will be very very mean to me and use our kids as pawns to manipulate them against me
1	I ve made my bed do I sleep in it
1	Hello , I am an 18 years old male and I have had this problem for several years
1	Whenever I 'm in social situations or around people I find it very hard to talk and be active in conversation
1	I 'll be in conversation and I will be genuinely interested in what someone is saying to me but I will appear like I 'm uninterested or I 'm annoyed by the person
1	I 'm completely aware when it happens and I try so hard to not be like that but I will always have to fake a laugh or a smile or expression to try and seem more like a normal person should act
1	People always tell me I 'm very drab or someone even told me I do n't act like a human once
1	I will feel awful and be thinking of things like suicide but then in a few hours I will feel amazing and it will go back and forth like this and it really interferes with my life
1	I always feel low on energy and I feel like its related
1	When it happens I just feel like I do n't have enough energy to show how I feel in my expression or body language
1	But the tired feeling I feel is n't as if I did n't sleep enough or something its more like I do n't have enough mental energy
1	oh , this may not be important but I am always always cold and I feel like that 's a result of the low energy as well
1	But I 'm not always like this and some days I will feel great and be energetic and funny and my speech sounds very well formed and intelligent and I will feel like I was perfect this day but its very unpredictable and the next day I might be back to a bad day
1	I 've been dating this girl and I feel terrible sometimes because it will happen to me and I feel like I 'm acting really uninterested in her , I really like her but I ca nt help it
1	I really want to get rid of this and I 've tried so hard to correct it
1	I consider myself in good physical health but this did not help me
1	I 've tried lots of things to try and get better sleep at night
1	Sometimes it wo nt even help , I 'll feel very awake and alert but still feel like there is this wall in my head keeping me from acting like I should
1	I 've even tried meditating but I have trouble getting into it
1	Every time I have a good day I will sit there and analyze it and look at what was unique and compare similarities between them
1	Some days I will have an especially bad day and feel back at square one
1	I 'm at the point where I do n't know what else I can do
1	I know that I can get rid of this problem because I have good days when I 'm perfect but I want more days to be like this
1	And when I talk to people online I 'm fine because i have that extra second to think of something good to say , so I know I have it in me
1	With this post I was hoping to get more of an idea of what this problem is so that I could make a new strategy to overcome it
1	I 'm sorry if this was n't the best category to post in but I feel like it has aspects of a few different disorders and was n't sure where to put it
1	I 've always had occasional bouts of depression , never lasting more than a few hours
1	About a year ago I had to have surgery for some issues with endometriosis
1	Before the surgery I was suffering a lot , and I was very upset about what I was going through
1	I remember one day when I came home from school I sat down and just screamed my lungs out for several minutes , I was so depressed
1	But after the surgery I feel much better , but I 'm still a little depressed
1	I 'm on Prozac 20 mg but I do n't think it seems to be doing much good
1	I still love my mom and my family , but as for my friends at school , and the people I used to think I could n't live without , I just do n't enjoy being around them anymore
1	I withdraw from social situations , I 'm extremely shy , and I do n't like talking or meeting new people
1	Most of the time I avoid having to talk at all if I do n't have to
1	I only feel like I really suffer from depression once or twice a week or so when I need to just lie in bed and cry for a little while
1	I need around 12 hours of sleep to be able to get through the day without a nap
1	my sister 3 weeks ago she went wrong , perhaps stress , perhaps something traumatic from excessive fear due to incidents in my country , do n't know , I just need to know which kind of doctors to consult
1	she then felt the pulses in her whole body , neck , the back , even in the legs toes a kind of earthquake in the whole body
1	As she felt ok , she started back to study today for her thesis , soon a relapse occurerd , heat in her brain and a new symptom appeared she ca n't bear loud sounds my question what kind of specialist we should consult ie
1	Also she ca n't sleep unless the air cooler is on during the whole night and even in daytime due to excessive heat in summer
1	Hi , everyone , well most of you know my story , married 30 years , he had a midlife crisis and left his family for a 22yr old neighbour , it has been 10 months now and our pregnant daughter has asked him and I to talk and become friends for the baby , it is important to her that her child has grandparents who like each other
1	I have tried every hard and he fought me all the way , so I said enough NO more thankyou
1	My daughter went off at ex hubby and now he is trying to be friends and Jess asked me to give he a second chance , which I have
1	He is no longer with the young girl and swearing to our daughter that nothing happened between them , I do nt believe it at all
1	He has told the kids he wants to see if he can fall in love with me again
1	He said he wants me not to date or sleep with anyone while we are tryingHowever I said to him do you have feelings for me and he said , I have no loving or romantic feelings toward meThen what gives , I was doing fine without him , and now I know in my head that I do not want this man , but the kids really want it and I am tried of pleasing everyone and not me By the way I was n't asked if I wanted to tryeveryone has decided for meSo give me your opinion
1	I 've been living with my abusive boyfriend since october of 09
1	He hits me for the slightest thing and talks to me like I 'm his slave
1	I 've been convincing myself that hell change , and I still think he will but the choice was recently taken from me
1	I 've never told my family about the abuse because my dad would literally kill him
1	Recently my mom asked if he 'd hit me , I told her no but my father showed up at my work today and told me that he and my uncle are moving me out of the apartment and they were n't having any arguments about it
1	On one hand it feels good to release some of the stress from dealing with this alone and I feel much safer now that my dads involved but he 's threatened to kill me on more than one occasion which is why I 've been so afraid to leave him
1	My situation is much better than most I imagine
1	My father is moving me into a new apartmentt , but my boyfriend knows where my dad lives where my mom lives my grandma , et cetera
1	I do n't know what hell do when I 'm not around my family like during work
1	My son is four years old and very smart
1	Up until about 8 months ago he was lovable and really into doing things with other kids and me
1	His biological dad left when he was 3 months old so it has been just me and him up until he was two and i meant my boyfriend who has been his father since
1	His real dad has a bad temper and i am wondering if he have gotten it from him
1	I have noticed a difference in my child
1	He does nt seem to want to do things with other kids and is mean to them
1	If they make him mad he will hit them
1	When he wants something he does nt ask for it he growls and yells at me like I knew he wanted it
1	He never asks for anything he tells me what to do
1	And when I tell him i am not giving it to him until he asks for it he growls at me
1	I thought this was a phase but its been like 6 months he has been doing it
1	When he gets mad he throws things and comes up to me and grabs my arm and tries clawing it
1	It makes me want to cry because he is nt the same lovable kid that would come sit on my lap and watch a movie or to cuddle
1	He has alot of anger towards my brother who has cp
1	I have no idea why but he always feels the need to yell at my brother and act like he is going to hit him
1	We ca nt even take him many places anymore
1	He is mean to people who try to be nice to him
1	When they ask him his name is replies with a growl
1	Since my relationship with my partner has gone on I seem to get angrier and angrier with him , I ca nt stop it , I try and just stay calm or even ignore him to stop going off but to no avail
1	It can be just something simple or to me something extreme for example ask him to go shopping with only a short list of items and he will somehow forget one of them this sets me off , or the mess he can make like just throwing orange peels on the floor and say oh will clean that up later , how hard is it to put things in the rubbish for goodness sake , or we just got KFC takeaway and he has eaten the chicken while driving and throws the bones in the back to the dog farrrr out
1	But wait there is more its never ending most people start there day even if they do n't have much to do , unless you are sickunwell by having a shower , brushing ones teeth and most of the time having breakfast but no not this guy , What the
1	To me I have reasons to suggest he does n't do those things , or do somethings like put rubbish in the bin , but he thinks I am going on about nothing , Can anyone suggest what I may be able to say to make him change his ways
1	my last time ws about 9 years ago
1	where i used to be a daily smoker , and i had a bad trip , where i got depressed after that night , i got panic attack , and the 2nd day i felt depressed and it went on for the about 6 months , as i used to get the feeling that i have a heavy cloud in my head , feeling it in my forehead and something pressing at the back of my headi started getting into the awareness of what my subconsioness doas is how am i breathing , how am i talking , how am i understanding what i am being toldhow words connect , how this and how thatand all this , and it is really bothering and annoyingand since then i stopped smoking weed till about a week agoi smoked a joint , and all went well , nothing of the sorti am in a situation now that is very stressful , and have a lot of problems and unemployed for the last 6 months practically , as everything seems to go the opposite way in my lifeanyway

1	i have n't even been on this site since like July
1	i started high school in august and immediately i started making new friends and i thought maybe this wo n't be so bad
1	i do n't really feel like i have a best friend , i do n't have anyone i can genuinely trust or go to when i 'm lonely
1	no one knows my story here and i do not plan to tell it
1	today we had our freshman retreat , i wanted to take it seriously because in the past i 'd really been helped and inspired by retreats
1	one activity was we had to write down something in our lives that weighs us down and then rip it up into a basket at the front of the room
1	i almost cried because i decided to write down my depression
1	i went up to the basket on the verge of tears and then i saw shreds of what other girls had written
1	most girls wrote schoolwork or my boyfriend or my personal favorite homecoming dress
1	i realized today that i 'm so different from the superficial girls around me
1	do n't get me wrong , not all of them are superficial
1	some girls are really nice but i still do n't fit in with them
1	another activity was we had a paper on our backs and people had to go around the room and write something positive on it
1	we took them off our backs and got to read the messages
1	the first thing i noticed was that i did n't have nearly as many as the girls around me
1	then i read them , most of them were a simple word like nice or pretty
1	how is ew jk ily supposed to make me feel when the girl next to me was being called inspiring and confident
1	i came home and asked my mom to see a therapist in a way that could 've been interpreted as sarcastic
1	my dad got mad at me
1	he said i should n't joke about those things and all teenage girls should be depressed
1	he says I 'm just a brooding teenager
1	i laugh but he does n't know how offended i really get
1	then he asked me if i really was depressed and after his whole speech about how i should n't make my mom waste money like that i did n't have the heart to tell him what i was really feeling so i said no
1	i feel like i 've missed my only shot at help
1	I am a sixteen year old girl and I am pretty sure I 've been depressed for approximately two years
1	I 've been feeling hopeless , sad , worthless , numb , I have suffered from insomnia , changes in appetite and suicidal thoughts
1	During this period I have been to two therapies I am not sure how to call therm but they were pretty much weekly meeting with a psychologist without any medication or help from psychiatrist
1	Each lasted a few weeks and ended up after the psychologist advised my parents to take me to a phychiatrist
1	Since I started feeling this way my mother has been extremely unsupportive towards me
1	She actually makes me feel even worse every time I try to talk to her about it
1	For example when a few months ago for the first time I told her that I wanted to die which unfortunately is true up to this day she told me that I am selfobsessed and selfish
1	She literally thinks that I have made up my sadness or that I am doing all of this for attention
1	I have lost hope that she could ever help me
1	She makes me feel that I am not worthy of help or love
1	This month is especially hard for me because I have A LOT of homework and tests due next week
1	And at the same time I feel terrible and I am unable to study
1	At least we have winter holidaywhich end in 3 days and I can spend all days at home
1	My friend advises me to go to the school counselor and I am afraid of doing this
1	Unfortunately , in my city to start any private therapy I need to go to the psychologist with my parents
1	Right now my mother is at work and I started to think about trying to talk to her and asking to take me to a psychologist but I am afraid of her reaction
1	Please tell me what you I should do
1	Thank you for your advice
1	I remember it being horrible , but because of my completely nonexistent memory , I do n't remember all of it
1	I know only one other person who has been on effexor xr almost as long and we have similar problems with our health
1	I ca n't find anything on the internet about the long term effects on your body , like kidneys , etc
1	I am on my first day of cutting the 300 in half , so I am ok , but I know and am very scared about what 's to come
1	I went on the med for severe depression and anger issues and I really hope it does n't come back
1	I am going off of it because all I want to do now is sleep or sit on the couch and watch tv
1	Not exactly where I should be right now in my life I am also having medical problems and wonder if any are from the effexor xr
1	I was standing in the kitchen perfectly fine making food when a loud bang when of in the kitchen from the gas stovetop I of course assumed the worse thinking the house was going to blow up , it was just the gas running out immediately my heart was pounding like crazy and all that normal anxious stuff which I get a lot cause I 'm quite an anxious person
1	However it did n't end there , I must admit i was still stressing about the gas and the noise happened a few more times , I started getting more sweaty and clammy which i did n't think much of either but It was really bad and I can still feel it as I write this , I also got shooting stabbing pains down my back which mixed with the sweat felt horrible , my head was hurting and I somehow convinced myself that I had n't eaten enough so I finished making food although my hands were shaking throughout it so i was moving really slow and kept almost dropping things
1	I was also spent all my energy on just standing up , not sure how I did it guess I was determined to eat the food as I thought it would give me energy
1	I searched my symptoms online and while most sounded really wrong panic attack symptoms sounded slightly similar
1	I felt horrible and it was definitely painful and everything but I was n't exactly terrified and I did n't feel like I was dying I was more like my body was glitching and my mind was just watching
1	I have had weirder more painful experiences than this when I thought I really was going to die so maybe that was why I was n't that scared Overall I am really confused and just do n't want to have on again , I only thought it was a panic attack cause I got a huge fright and then my body kinda freaked out and sweating and shaking and there was stabbing shooting pains down my back and I got all weak and only just know after 15min after it ' ended ' I feel normal again
1	I hope someone can send me in the right direction because as i said before I have had weirder but similar things happen that ca n't be virus related as everything goes back to normal about 15 min after
1	Hello I 'm 25 years old and I have depression that sets in and stays for days to weeks
1	Its been going on since I was a girl along with it I pull out my hair and have chronic pain and fatigue
1	I have weight gain and feel worthless most days
1	It does seem to go away when I get out and about but the simple things like a bill or a phone call can change my mood and Its so hard to get back from that point
1	Its getting to the point where life is not as promising as I thought it was staring at the barrel of 30 years old
1	I fear I wo nt ever finish college or own my own business
1	I have great dreams but get derailed several weeks at a time
1	I 'm mother to a wonderful 6 year old
1	He is my world and I would love to be more active with him but as I write this I am in bed
1	In bed is where I am most days
1	I only ever remember feeling balanced when I was pregnant with my son

1	Girls it is highly unlikely you can get pregnant from oral sex fingering , licking ,   you are fertile all the way through the month and so can get pregnant at any time although some points your more fertile than others
1	If you are scared that you might be pregnant wait until a week after you miss a period then take a test first thing in the morning as that 's when its most accurate if it shows that you arnt pregnant then wait another week and test again it could be too early to tell if you keep getting negative tests and still have nt come on your period its probably because you are stressing but go to the doctors just to get checked out incase
1	Lots of women have many different symptoms of being pregnant so asking how you should feel at that moment in time does nt mean that you will feel the same as someone else who is pregnant
1	If you do nt want a baby do not have unprotected sex and do nt just rely on one form of contraception as they can fail , for all the girls please do nt just have sex with anyone make sure you have thought it through anf use protection also makr sure it is your decision and do nt get pressured into anything it needs to be up to you
1	I know we are all from different backgrounds and different parts of the world so we all have a different education
1	I m not trying to be rude just trying to educate the ones eho arnt so sure so that they do nt get slated and upset from others writing rude comments on their posts
1	If any of you want any questions answering about anything please feel free to email me I personally do nt mind answering any of your questions
1	Instead he wants me to start taking estrogen cream and progesterone cream because of borderline low estrogen and my menopausal symptoms of hot flashes , irritability , insomnia , fluctuating periods
1	He says I 'm not in menopause but that its prob a pituitary issue
1	I 'm a little concerned because I 've had abnormal paps and thickened uterine lining that comes and goes and fibroids that have been getting slowly bigger , as well as mildly high can 125 for a few years
1	Is it safe for me to take this hormone replacement therapy if I 'm not in menopause and still have all my parts , especially if I 've had abnormal paps and an increased risk for cervicaluterineenfometrious cancer
1	My periods have been stable the last few months but I usually have either normal or too close together periods
1	Maybe the meds will help but I think I have thyroid probs more on the hyperside but because I 'll have an abnormal test but then a normal test , the abnormals are being considered flukes
1	I 'm so tired of chasing my tail
1	Hello , I 'm a single female   30 years old no kids , never been married
1	I 've always suffered from some sort of minor depression , OCD tendencies , anxiety ,   severe insomnia
1	I went through a break up around the holidays in 2013   that triggered the escalation of my depression
1	I have 3 college degrees up to a Masters   had plans to relocate this Fall   find a job in a new city to help get me out of this depression
1	However in June I got a misdemeanor charge of possession of Marijuana
1	I 've been forced to put off my plans to move because of it
1	Due to this ongoing charge I ca n't really get hired anywhere outside of min wage job , which wo n't help me pay off student loans
1	However I ca n't go into the classroom until charge dismissed , which could take up to a year
1	Basically because Marijuana is the only thing I 've found that gives me some sort of piece of mind in the evenings , I 'm forced to put my whole life on hold for possibly a year
1	I feel like I 'm just falling further   further
1	I spend nearly all night crying   if lucky enough to actually fall asleep I wake up in tears
1	I 'd rather just lie under the covers all day   not do anything
1	Every time I 'm alone , especially each day during my 1 hour commute one way 2 hrs total , I 'm crying my eyes out
1	I feel like I ca n't breathe
1	I feel like I 'm nothing   thus will amount to nothing
1	I know eitherway I 'll never have kids of my own or be married because how can anyone possibly love me
1	However I m lucky to get 3 hours max
1	I 'm so tired of being tired ALL the time believe me , I 've tried EVERYTHING meds   natural remedies galore for sleep
1	I hate taking any sort of prescription drugs , I only use herb Marijuana nothing helps with my anxiety , depression   insomnia , but that
1	I 'm on the verge of giving up entirely because I 'm just a waste of space
1	I am 15 years old and have always had anxiety which recently got worse
1	I am just starting to see the heavier effects of puberty growth spurt , voice change , etc and just started to get extremly depressed to where i do nt want to talk to friends , go to school , play my favorite sport , lost motivation , constantly wanting to sleep , always thinking about past mistakes , worrying about every little thing , and getting sad at random times
1	I started using marijuana a year ago but have been using it alot more in the past few months to help cope with the constant stress and anxiety but i think it may have been too much since its all i want to do anymorei would use it every day over the summer and every weekendsome week days during school
1	I am going to see a therapist soon to see if i can get medication to hopefully help offset the marijuana addiction
1	Hello , I am a graduate student in my midtwenties who is at a loss of what to do regarding my best friend of 5 years with BPD
1	She is intelligent and knows what the consequences of her behavior will be , but ca n't stop making the wrong choices , ie
1	She is living off her parents money , and has been without a job for year though she could easily obtain a part time job
1	Though that is perhaps none of my business it bothers me because I value hard work and would never take money from my parents unless I had no other optionto me it seems she is taking advantage of them
1	Our friendship has had its ups and downs as you can probably imagine
1	She seems to warp situations in her mind when she is going through particularly difficult life circumstances so that everyone turns into the enemy
1	During these times it 's exhausting to be her friendI want to be there for her to listen , but eventually it starts affecting my life negatively because she can be so demanding and combative , even though I 'm on her side
1	She has really high expectations for how she should be treated by her friends , but has been rude and extremely inconsiderate to me in the past
1	Any time I 've tried to explain to her calmly and respectfully that sometimes the way she treats me makes me feel bad she becomes extremely defensive and turns the situation around , becoming angry that I 'm expressing these feelings
1	As I mentioned before , she recently encountered some trouble with the law as a result of being a relationship she knew was horrible
1	When I asked her if she still wanted to go , she became really mad , eventually sending me a barrage of text messages with things like I 'm going to be sad either way , I thought the trip would be good to get my mind off things , but if you 're just going to be frustrated with how I 'm acting we 're not going to have any fun so I wo n't go
1	I was just asking to be considerate of what she was going through , I did n't want her to feel like she had to go if she had other things she needed to take care of
1	That is just a minor , most recent example of an interaction with her , but it demonstrates how confusing it can be to be her friend
1	When that happened I just felt so exhaustedI spend so much of my time listening to her about her problems and trying to be a good friend and I do n't feel like it 's appreciated or reciprocated
1	My other friends tell me I need to distance myself , that I 've tried all I can , and that there 's nothing I can do to help her be happy
1	Right now I 'm feeling like that 's my best option as well
1	I feel guilty because I do n't want to abandon her but I do n't feel like my friends should cause me as much stress and heartache as she does
1	I 'm disperateSo let 's beginI'm from Romaniaa country where educational systems are oudated and full of useless informationsbasically too much information for brain to retainand i 'm in a highschoolThe good part is that the teachers are friendly and help me a lot at everythingI was dumb at chemistry but now since the teacher adapted to my style of learningit workedIt will happen rarely to get bad marks at everythingBut the math teacher is like a ninjaShe is good with who knows mathat perfectionbut with some students like meI'm really a good person who is focused at her lessonsBut i do nt understand anythingHe give us to many test papersI mean alotWhile at everything we have barely 4 gradesShe does n't help me and i told herMy parents wo n't believe that and acuse me that i 'm the culprit   in this situationIm bad at mathreally badShe wo nt talk with me or say helloIm scared of her more than i should be of lionsIn our country if you get bad marksyou will not pass the class and you should go in autumn for an exam to pass named corigentaIf you do nt pass ityou will never pass the classI have nightmaresI really cry a lotHow i can became again a manI hope i wrote right the story because english is not my first language
1	My daughter , who will be 5 in a couple months and in PreKindergarten
1	Last year , August 2006 , I recieved full custody of my daughter and my exwife recieved only supervised visits a couple Saturdays a month
1	During that time , my fiance became Mama to my daughter
1	This was not pushed by me , my fiance , or our families
1	This came from my daughter one night
1	She had replaced my exwife on her own and found my fiance to be the kind of woman that she wanted in her life
1	In March , my exwife decided to act upon her visitation schedule and see my daughter
1	The first visit lasted 4 hours and after those 4 hours , my daughter had recessed from the previous 8 months that my ex had not been in her life
1	During this visit , my ex told my daughter that she was going to take her from me and my fiance at a grocery store for her to live w my ex forever
1	This disturbed me and my fiance
1	Two weeks later , my ex saw her again
1	Two weeks after that , when my daughter saw her play therapist , it came out that my ex had told my daughter that she was going to kill her and herself so that they could be in heaven forever
1	This disturbed me , as it would anyone , to the point where I violated the court order and got a protective order for my daughter against my exwife
1	She then did n't see her for another 4 12 months
1	A judge granted her a chance to continue supervised visits and she did for one visit on August 18th
1	Since then , she has cancelled one visit and did n't show up to another one on Sept 8th
1	What kind of emotional damage or psychological damage could come from the actions of my exwife toward my daughter
1	Hi , I need to make sense out of my anxiousness that I get
1	I mean , It feels like I want to call it paranoia because I get anxious and tense in my mindhead and am in an unrealxed state
1	This comes on in response to constant worry , and when I stop worrying , and just realize I need to calm down I begin to gradually become calm
1	Actually , I have been under constant concern and worry to some great extent about things for a while now , especially since a nervouse breakdown I had a year ago , still not recovered really
1	I feel like I have to relax myself , and get away from interacting with people when this gets bad
1	I mean it is almost always happening to some extent , but soemtimes it is hardly there , sometimes it is not there at all and I feel basically relaxed and well
1	I mean not fully well because I am still telling myself that I am still getting better from that nervous breakdown I had a year ago
1	Also , my head is often very tense , and my temple veins swell
1	If you have any insight please let me know
1	Hi , I have been diagnosed with borderline personality structure   disorder very recently although supposedly I have had it for years
1	As far as I can remember , I have not been sexually abused
1	I 'm turning myself inside out trying to work out how and why I developed this
1	I 'm trying to work out if I have repressed the memory of being sexually abused
1	But I do n't know if this is because I 'm getting a bit psychotic at the moment
1	A doctor told me that I could have it because I was bullied at school and my parents did n't validate my feelings growing up
1	I ca n't quite believe him
1	I had some traumatic experiences with an exboyfriend of mine committing suicide because I broke up with him but this was n't till I was 17 , and I thought to get BPD you had to have trauma at a very early age
1	I have looked at the DSM criteria for BPD and as far as I can tell I have all of the symptoms
1	In 2007 , I was diagnosed with bladder cancer , via a FISH urine test
1	Instead , I submitted to a cystoscopy every six months
1	I did this for two years 20072009 , and one time between 2010 and 2013
1	In 2014 , I did another cystoscopy , and FISH urine test
1	They also came up negative and of course , this means I can not receive treatment , BECAUSE there is no target location to direct the treatment
1	My doctor urologist describes this as a “ slow moving cancer ” , which will manifest at some point , and I will receive a targeted treatment
1	So , here I am   eight years after the initial diagnosis of a killer disease , WITHOUT TREATMENT
1	I am petrified of this so called “ slow moving cancer ” spreading slowly , and doing me in
1	My boyfriend of a year or so recently broke up with me
1	I know its for the best as he was emotionally abusive and had some issues as well with ptsd from the armyand i pushed him away as i do everyone
1	It has taken me a while to realize that but i understand now
1	But I still really love him i know he has some problems and i know deep down he is a good person if he would just let some one help him
1	His best friend and his parents no longer speak to him becuase of the way he treats people
1	He had an ex wife who he treated bad as well
1	Before we broke up we were aruing a lot i moved away to be with him and could nt find a job so i was stressed outand had recently lost my mom
1	When i moved out he helped me pack all my stuff and drove the moving truck for me   i live 2 or so hours away   to a storage and helped me un pack everythingnot to mention paid for all the gas for the truck i had to drive him back and since it was a long drive i stayed to get some sleep and he kissed me on the cheek the next morning and bought me lunch before i left
1	i thought he was just being nice or feels guilty becuase the whole time he kept telling me how much he still loves me and how hard this is for him
1	He texted me that night and the next night from there we both have texted each other , the other day he told me he may have a job overseas he text me and was so happy i was happy for him and i recently got offered a job where he lives well were we lived too
1	it was from an old app i put in and he told me to take ithuhhe will start the texts happy and then sometimes its like i m bothering him
1	almost like he is waiting for me to tell him i want him back i m confused why is he even texting me and why he is happy one moment then irratated the next
1	I do nt know maybye were playing games i do nt know if we are being honest with each otherIm tired of the pain

1	i suffered from bpd for years
1	It ruined my life , relationships , family , and almost lost my daughter to cps , or her daddy
1	Once I accepted the bpd , I started a therapy called DBT
1	It taught me that my feelings were valid , but that I was in my emotional mind
1	I was taught to use my reasonable mind to find a middle ground
1	You choose what target behavior you want to change , but do n't talk about it in group , only to say you had a target behavior that week , our that there were none
1	If I do get into a tizzy and really need some help , I can call our text my therapist , and she will give me 3 skills to try so I can regulate my emotions
1	I am much more even , calm , confident , happy , and my life is so different from a year ago when I started
1	I graduate in december
1	It us a 6 month program that you repeat once , you 'll find this helpful
1	I just realized that my family member most likely has BPD
1	I should have realized as I studied psychology for awhile
1	When we first because close it was like she worshipped the ground I walked on , always came to me for advice , always wanted to take tons of pictures together whenever we were around , would tell me she could n't wait to see me again and loved me like a best friend or sister
1	This went on for several months but there would be some times where she would kind of stop talking to me so much and I noticed she was making these grand proclamations about other people new friends instead of me
1	Then she 'd come back to me and I was surprised because all she would talk about was how much she hated those same people   for very irrational reasons aka she did n't like my post on Facebook
1	Now all of a sudden she stopped talking to me , stopped answering me when I tried to reach her , and when I reached out to see if everything was okay she basically said leave me alone
1	So does this sound like she has BPD
1	Is she in a devaluing stage with me right now
1	It   as she is a bridesmaid in my wedding and she is family and it hurts to not have her supporting me anymore
1	He 's been going to two different doctor to figure out what is wrong with him but neither one know for sure
1	One claims that he has Non Hodgkin 's Lymphoma , then backtracks
1	He has lost a tremendous amount of weight this past year
1	He ca n't gain the weight back no matter what his diet
1	He 's eaten all sorts of fatty foods including KFC 5 times per week , candy , Popsicles , etc 3
1	He 's contracted Jr onset diabetes from this illness and has to check his blood sugar frequently
1	Doctor 's found 6 masses in his stomach but , according to him , they said they are n't large enough to be causing the problem
1	He has also said that they are n't sure if they are malignant or benign even after biopsy
1	Doctors have told him that if his weight drops below 130lbs , he will have to be admitted to the hospital
1	He is afraid that he wo n't be around in 6 months
1	Hello everyone I 'm 19 years old and I have a 4 year old girl and a 3 month baby that I 'm breast feeding
1	When I was 8 months pregnant I started feeling alone
1	But now his about to be 4 months and I 'm getting worst
1	Everytime I 'm feeling sad or down or just had an argument with my husband I get this anxity and ca n't control my self and start eating
1	Just last Friday I bought two pizzas and I ate one whole pizza and like four slizes from the other box
1	Before I was even pregnant with my boy I remember I could n't eat more than 4 and then after eating so much I feel so guilty and do n't want to eat at all and after a day of only eating fruit water or even nothing I do the same thing
1	I 've been feeling so fat , ugly , and I just hate my body what can I do to get out of this problem
1	And should I just stop feeding my child and just give him formula
1	I just ended my one year abusive relationship with my boyfriend
1	However , i started to hit him back and lash out at him the way he would to me
1	He said whenever he hit me or yelled obscene things its because i egged him on and deserved it , but he got to know my triggers so well and made me lash out
1	He was a recovering heroin and crack addict and i stayed behind him
1	His mother and old doctor suspected borderline personality which made him a master manipulator
1	I moved out of my house and was at his beck and call
1	My life was work and trying to please him
1	For the six months i lived with him , i saw my mother probably three times
1	Our breakup was nasty , he demeaned me in front of my cousins boyfriend , calling me a fat   i 'm 125 pounds and 5'5 , not fat , i finally believe i m not fat so i packed stuff up and went to my cousins
1	My cousins boyfriend stayed , they drank two bottles of whiskey , and got a hooker
1	when i confronted him on it , he slapped me across the face , so i hit him
1	he punched me and yelled and bruised my face , ribs , and gave me a concussion
1	He said he was nt thinking straight , he was drunk , and he was ashamed , but i am so done with the violence that kept escalting
1	what i need to know is am i just as bad as him for hitting him
1	for reacting when he wanted me to
1	I have been masterbating since I can remember , and I always reached orgasm I did n't know about sex but I liked doing it because I felt ' naughty ' and when I was a bit older from the age of 6 I used to think about seeing a boy naked and wanting to touch them
1	When I was playing with my friend , we used to pretend to get married to big teddy bears and have babies and I would make us ' pretend ' to have sex with the teddy bears and I would masterbate to orgasm
1	During my teenage years I had issues with sexuality and my sexual identity
1	Sometimes I thought I was gay , sometimes I felt straight , sometimes I wanted to have a sex change to be a boy
1	In my early 20s I became very sexually active , I was reckless and ' doing ' whoever wanted too
1	I am currently engaged to a wonderful man and am loyal to him
1	In the last 2 months I have been diagnosed with boderline line personality and bipolar 2
1	I have been hospilized and spent a night in jail for violentmanic behaivour
1	I am working through all these issues with a councellor but I ca nt help wonder if I was sexually abused when I was younger I have vague memories of something not right but have zero idea who it would have been and if it is even true or I am making it up
1	I saw that ' sleep problems ' was an appropriate topic for this forum , so I 'm hoping for the benefit of you good folks ' expertise
1	Here 's what works ninety percent of the time 1 lunesta or sonata whichever is available to me at the time , 2 ounces of Nyquil , 2 over the counter sleep aids 50 mg of whatever puts the ' PM ' in ' Tylenol PM ' and one mg xanax
1	Subtract the 1 mg of xanax , which I often do n't include in order to avoid developing a tolerance , and the success rate drops to perhaps sixty or seventy percent , and it takes a couple of hours to work
1	What I 'd like to know is if you folks have any suggestions regarding what I might ask the VA people to provide that might be powerful enough to knock me out for the night , yet not be as destructive of my liver as I 've been led to believe the combinations I use now are
1	Thank you very much in advance for your time
1	Last June wen I was 18 I went on a holiday with my friends family
1	One the fourth day in I was on a boat trip in extreme heat with no protection drinking alcohol a lot
1	We then went to get a kebab and then go out after but I just did n't feel strong or fully with it
1	So I said I was going to call it a night
1	That night I woke up around 2 am feeling enclosed like I could n't get out of this place and so alone , I believe it to be a panic attack and had to walk it of for so long
1	I got up the next day and must of been dehydrated but stupidly got a coffee
1	Ever since I woke up I just felt so drowsy but I went on the trip
1	It got to the point at dinner time where I felt I could no longer have the energy to walk and felt like I could collapse any second
1	I lay down out the way of everyone barely able to talk , I asked for an ambulance and as it being turkey they say to expensive
1	Bearing in mind we was 30 miles away fr anywhere they called for a taxi
1	I dragged myself in to the taxi and got back to the hotel as the family said it would be best to go there first and see how I feel soon
1	So I did and I was that fatigue I just lay in bed
1	I was then woken by a doctor who had benlen called and did n't seem at all like it was critical and if I 'm honest I know how it looks
1	This lad has been drinking heavy for the past week and its all caught up with him now
1	I layer in bed for next two days barely managing to eat and serve diarrhea
1	I remember nothing of the journey as if I was n't even there
1	I got home and was in bed for days before eventually going to the doctors for bloods and urine and all came back fine
1	It has been 7 months now and I struggle to get through everyday life
1	Depression and anxiety has hit me so hard and I 'm that weak I struggle to do the simplest tasks
1	I can still feel a big pressure in my head and my eyes
1	My neck has serious pain everyday and at night my heart races when I try to go to bed
1	I have been on cit 20 mg around 2 months ago but came of them as nothing changed
1	I just seriously do n't understand why this has happened and why i still have it
1	I do get the worst thoughts but I have to go walk them of and distract myselfI walk around all day like a zombie with no energy and constant light headedness
1	I am hoping you could help me
1	My OBGYN put me on the pill to help my symptoms but I had an awful reaction to it ie , chest pain , anxiety , shortness of breath
1	He then prescribed an antianxiety pill , which I did not take
1	I began doing a lot of research and have come to the conclusion that I would like to try a bioidentical compound
1	I asked him about it but he does not deal with bioidenticals
1	I asked if I could have my hormones tested , which he did
1	My results confirmed my suspicions that I am perimenapausal
1	The doctors notes indicate I could start Prempro 62525 as a trial as a result of my testing
1	Instead I chose to start Emerita , a progesterone cream , and am now on day 4 and have begun spotting and am very bloated
1	I am only using one packet a day as I figured I would start slow
1	not sure i can type up my whole storyits too long the short of it is i was in a very abusive marriage for about 17 years
1	I finally left 15 years ago but even now he continues to make my life helll
1	I hate him so much that it eats me up inside
1	I have nt healed in this past year and a half
1	My wounds still feel as raw as they did back then
1	I just do nt know how to cope much anymore and he is continually finding ways to get to me from afar even
1	Threatning to blow my cats head off and doing bad stuff when our 2 little boys visit with him
1	He talks bad about me to them and when they come back from a day with him , they act out towards me with hostility and namecalling
1	thankfully they are sweet and sensitive boys and they quickly realize what they said or did was wrong and cuddle with me and apologize , and soon they return to their normal selves until they have to go visit him again
1	and now recently on a visit , their dad had a ragetantrum in front of them and tore all the papers off his fridge sent magnets flying everywhere , papers got torn and ruined
1	Some of them said i love you dad and I love you mom on them
1	I was furious when i heard about it , and then cried my eyes out
1	I m so sick of this , but do nt know what to do   The depression is really starting to hit me hard lately from this
1	and USA must be happy when we die because population will reduce
1	Sometimes i think they are changing people mind
1	There is such such a dangerous very very very dangerous system no matter how much religious he or she is they will be just opposite by my method
1	if they go through my process they will be fully changed
1	I think they are tired of killing religious people
1	I 'm going to let you all know I am about to turn 14 and I used to self harm starting when my parents started fighting
1	I moved to a new town with my mom and visited my best friend and his brother and noticed his brother being a flirt and being all touchy so after one to two hours of hanging out with them I went home
1	Later that night his brother messaged me on Facebook and told me he wanted to go out with me and that his brother already gave him a talk so I said yes the next day I went over there to hang out again and he started hitting me for no reason he left bruises on my arms and thighs and everyone thought he would never hit a girl because he watched his dad beat his mom for 15 years
1	Well I thought he just had an off day and needed to let go of some steam because the next day he was apologizing and being all loving again so I forgave him
1	I realized the day after that he was n't having an off day because he beat me so bad that I cried
1	I did fight back a little but he just hit me harder
1	I had bruises and cuts from him beating me
1	He broke up with me for someone else the next day
1	Our moms were good friends so I went to his house a lot
1	When he got done with that girl he came running back if me and since I 'm so stupid I took him back
1	He abused me for almost a month before I broke up with him
1	Then he went to my best friend and broke her heart and I do n't know why I took him back but I did
1	Then he came to my house drunk and left bruises on my face , arms , and legs and had almost succeeded in pushing me into traffic
1	I know have someone I really love and I have n't cut in almost 9 months and my ex said he was going to tell my mom I cut
1	Now i have n't been clincally diagnosed with MDD but I 'm pretty certain i have it , i m always depressed
1	Now i am having a hard time wondering if i truly have MDD or if i 'm just another grumpy teeni do not experience any of the joys of the teenage years , example I become more depressed on fridays because i know i do n't have any plans and it 's an extremely lonely feeling
1	I 'm a very negative person , i 'm always the overthinker
1	I smoke weed everyday , i feel as if it is the only drug that takes away my depression , not just when i 'm stoned but also for many hours after
1	from personal experience marijuana CAN act as an antidepressant and i would recommend it
1	However I 've token many legal anti depressants and they do not work they make me just want to take more
1	But marijuana in my opinion is just a temporary solution and i know it wo n't completely cure my depression
1	maybe i m just always unhappy and it is my personality
1	I have been dealing with the most difficult year and a half in my life
1	I feel just so stressed out and depressed I honestly do n't know wat to do anymore
1	In December of 2012 I gave birth to my beautiful babygirl
1	She was premature , I was only 29 weeks wen I had her
1	Now while my daughter was in the NICU she had 2 surgeries PDA ligation   ileostomy and I was also told she had a grade 4 bleed in her brain
1	About 2 and a half months into her hospital stay my husband told me that his cancer had come back
1	We had been together since high school and we 're under the impression although he was in remission he would never have children
1	Needless to say we did have a beautiful baby girl who is his twin
1	upon telling me his cancer had returned I was devastated
1	I knew how he felt about going back on chemotherapy , it was n't an option
1	He refused to go thru it all over again after only being in remission 2 and a half years
1	They did tell him if his cancer came back in less than 5 years he would n't have a fighting chance
1	One day while visiting my daughter in the NICU I had n't heard much from my husband but knew he was n't feeling well
1	When I had finally finished up with my daughter 's visit I went home only to find my husband dead in our bed
1	I tickled his feet thinking he was sleeping and he did n't flinch
1	Thinking he felt cold from the windows being open I covered him with a blanket and leaned down to kiss him
1	Wen my lips touched his they were cold and stiff
1	My daughter was still in the hospital wen I buried him and released exactly 4 days after his burial
1	I feel as though I am a completely different person since this has happened and have no one to turn to
1	If it was n't for our daughter I do n't know where I would be right now
1	However Until I was 13 we attended then we stopped going
1	I am now 28yrs
1	Everytime I had a crisis , I prayed for Peace
1	A few months ago my brother died , and every since I have thoughts that there is not meaning to life , NOt suicidal , but spiritualy
1	We come here to Live Maybe Suffer , and when we Die , we have not consience and there is no other REalm
1	Death Is My Number one fear , and As a little girl I always had Crazy dreams of the demons bad spirits after me , Or the End of the World Constantly in Dreams
1	So when I would eat , death was on my mind , that I may choke , showering that I may fall , driving that I may Crash , going outside that someone will Harm me
1	Now this past Month , its just God , where are you
1	God are you true , when we Die we just die , we will never know the works of Earth , we will never know what happens to the World , to our Family , What is to come
1	I am going from Spirituality , to Evolutionist
1	I do nt like the thoughts , are CONSTANT PARANOIDIC TYPE THOUGHTS
1	I have never been diagnosed with any mental illness , I am hispanic and was raised in church
1	I would discuss this with my mother and she would just say , Your strong , its just the devil getting to you , YOu do nt need medication , that will just clog up your mind
1	As I am currently going through a divorce I ca n't help but think of how my soon to be exwife will be going into her second divorce
1	The circumstances are hauntingly familiar and it made me realize that some people really should n't be married to anyone until they take care of their own emotional wellbeing first
1	That being said , please take time to read the below marriage vows and if you feel you may fall into the category of someone that needs to take care of yourself first before dragging someone else into your life , do n't recite these until that has been done first
1	Male I , take you , to be my wedded wife
1	And hereto I pledge you my faithfulness
1	Female I , , take you , to be my wedded husband
1	And hereto I pledge you my faithfulness

1	Hi I am a 29yr old female and in 2001 something happened to me whilst holidaying in Turkey
1	I was 15 at the time and my mum and I decided to go on a girls ' only holiday
1	Motherdaughter bonding I presume , looking back
1	So we booked to go for a week to a hotel we went to 5 years before as we both enjoyed our stay and found the staff really friendly
1	A few days into our stay my mum flirted with a male guest   she was quite drunk and she was kissing him
1	She knew he had a girlfriend staying with him but she seemed to overlook this when under the influence
1	The bartender who was 7 years older than me he was 22 , I was 15 came out from behind the bar and kissed me
1	He then put his hand down the front of my skirt and touched me
1	After doing that he took his hand away and took his   out of his shorts
1	He got hold of my hand and put it on top of his , telling me to stroke it and that I would like it
1	Before long my mum , the guy she was flirting with , the bartender and I were all sitting in the outside dining area watching the cable TV
1	At the time I just saw what we were watching as a man and two women hugging and kissing each other
1	The bartender then slipped his hand under me and rubbed the underside of my pants
1	I told him it hurt and he said to me wait , you 'll like it and he inserted his finger up inside
1	He asked me if I had done it and I said no and he then asked me if I would like him to take my virginity away
1	I did n't answer but he kept telling me to come to bed with him
1	When my mum decided it was time we went to bed I kept saying to her that I thought the bartender was really nice and I really liked him that I can not work out , thinking back and she said I think he 's nice , too
1	The next day the bartender saw me in the pool in my bikini and he gestured for me to come over to him
1	He asked me where did you go last night
1	You did not come to bed with me
1	I said no , I had to make sure my mum got back to her room safely
1	He then said , well , I have the key to one of the hotel rooms
1	Meet me there in ten minutes
1	I went over to my mum and said Umm , mum
1	What would you say if   asked me to come to a hotel room to see him
1	Her response was I 'll f'ing deck him one
1	I then went back on what I said as I was afraid of us being thrown out of the hotel since the guy worked there and told her that nothing of the sort was said
1	I see a counselor at the moment about what had happened back in 2001 and as I thought about that I then remembered something intimate that had gone on between my younger female cousin and I and I think it has messed up my sexuality
1	I was 13 and she was 6
1	She was around my grandparents ' house whilst her mum and dad my auntie and uncle were away
1	She asked if we could play doctor
1	I said ok and she wanted to play doctor and have me as the patient
1	She asked me to take my clothes off and lie down on my back on the floor
1	So I had my trousers pulled down and my top pulled up
1	She put her hand on my tummy and moved her hand down towards my   but did not touch it
1	We then heard my grandfather outside and I quickly got up and tried to zip up my trousers before he noticed they were down
1	He looked at me I ca n't remember how he was looking at me as I do n't think I gave him any eye contact due to feeling so uncomfortable and he said to me put your trousers back on , what will your mother say when she sees you like that
1	I felt incredibly guilty and awkward about the whole thing and my cousin gave me this innocent look too
1	I mean , she was only 6 at the time
1	I found out a few months ago that she had come out of the closet and was seeing other girls
1	Which I thought was fine but my grandparents do n't like to mention her very much in our conversations
1	As I got older I noticed that my grandfather was looking at certain parts of me when I lived with them or went to certain places with them
1	When we were in Benidorm in 2005 I was in a changing room and he casually mentioned I had wellformed ts when I was changing into a top I wanted
1	He saw me topless by looking through the changing room 's curtain and seeing my reflection in the mirror
1	I 've also caught him looking down my topfront of my dressfront of my bath towel
1	And I do n't have a great pair of ts at all , small like an 11 year old 's
1	He 's even found some of my sex toys and asked me how they feelhow they work
1	I felt very uncomfortable when he asked me to show him
1	This is all what I feel has really impacted on my emotionalsexualintimate life and I have n't yet told my counselor about the situation with my cousin or grandfather
1	I do n't feel as though I can now as he wants me to work towards expressing my hidden feelings with the assault in 2001
1	This has put me off internal examscervical screening tests with the doctors which I am not sure if I need to go through with or not as I am not sexually active but have used sex toys and have problems with my cycles and I have been intimate with my boyfriend of 11 years
1	I feel so mixed up with how I feel as I feel so dirty and ashamed with my feelingspast experiences
1	And that the things my grandfather did looking at me with no bratop on and commenting on it and also the stuff going on with the sex toys makes me feel a bitI do n't knowon edge with him , I guess
1	This feels incredibly weird and strange for me to talk about but I guess what I am trying to say is that I feel safer and more emotionallyphysically closer with another woman
1	My fantasies even involve me kissing , touching and hugging another woman and it 's making me question my sexuality
1	I keep asking myself am I straight or bisexual or gay , it 's a constant debate on my mind as I then tell myself that no I ca n't be bisexual or gay if I do n't find women attractive
1	It 's like my thoughts are fighting with each other   back and forward , back and forward   whenever I go to a sex shop , go out clubbing with my friends , I am intimate with my boyfriend or by myself
1	  I believe that what has gone on has made me distrust men although I completely trust my boyfriend as he knows when no from me means no and will only touch me when I am relaxed and I say so
1	I feel so alone in how I feel right now
1	I m a 17 year old gay guy and I 'm finding it really hard to cope with life , I have hardly any friends and I find it hard to fit in Because I have low self esteem issues and I m not into the popular culture of today , finding a partner is really hard and stressful for me and I cry a lot Because I believe I will be lonely forever
1	I try to find new partners all the time using Facebook and other sociol networks , I keep arranging to meet up with boys and I trust them Because I know they are there for the same reason as I am and also I am more careful about weather someone is really who they say they are Because I video chat or phone them , anyway , I have met a couple of boys I really like , but I always get so paranoid as to wether they like me or not despite the fact they say they do , also I always try to organise dates where we can meet but it either gets cancelled or my social phobia stops me from doing so , the worst part is my paranoia towards them , i feel it agitates them and they get put off , I just do n't know what to do , my life was onnce so full of joy and I always used to be happy , now I feel like I 've lost everything , I do n't know what to do
1	I 'm a 18 year old female , and I 've been having issues with this since I was about 11
1	I just ca n't motivate myself to ever do anything I literally spend an hour just staring at some random object and trying to convince myself to go get food or use the bathroom
1	And I just have these downward mood spirals , where one thought just drags me down into this pit of despair where all my bad thoughts just cycle around and around
1	I 'll just sit in my closet sobbing for hours , and I ca n't explain to anyone why I 'm crying if they catch me
1	Even if I want to tell them , it likes my throat locks up and I feel like I 'm being tortured
1	I do n't think I 'd actually do it , but during these times , I have thoughts of suicide
1	Like I said , I do n't think I 'll actually do it , though
1	They 're always elaborate enough that it has to be planned for a future date and I pull myself out of my downward mood swings after a good nights sleep
1	I do n't cut , but I kinda have a tendency to bite my hand in an effort to calm myself down I do n't break the skin or anything , though
1	It 's kinda my equivalent to punching a wall when I get upset , since I do n't want to damage our apartment and get my parents mad
1	I have been married to a high functioning BPD woman undiagnosed for five years , and we have a two year old daughter together
1	I suppose my story is typical , in that when things are good they are wonderful , and when they are bad they are so terrible , confusing , bewildering and disturbing that I do not even know what day it is
1	She can be fine for periods of a few days to a few weeks , and then go to the dark side where I am the devil incarnate and to blame for everything , also for periods lasting a few days to a few months
1	I have dropped hints that she may need help , and her best friend and her sister , with both of whom I am very close , are also well aware that she has very serious emotional control issues and have tried to discuss them with her , but she absolutely refuses to admit that there is a problem the closest she has got is the admission that I know I can be very emotional at times
1	I have even chosen the tack that we both have issues and offered to go to get help together , but she always finds a very flimsy excuse not to follow this course of action
1	Generally she is a fantastic mother , but when she is going through a bad period she behaves in ways towards our daughter which I find utterly sickening
1	She will constantly , and using utterly foul language , tell our two year old in no uncertain terms what a terrible father she has despite the fact that the day before she might be chastising her for not wanting to play with her wonderful , amazing daddy
1	Also , if our little one is playing up , which often happens , my wife is capable of losing her temper with our daughter as quickly as she does with me
1	This only lasts for maybe thirty seconds at a burst , but the ferocity of her anger towards a toddler is frightening , and she has handled her physically more roughly than I certainly would
1	Although she mentioned when she threatened to kick me out before for checking the football scores on my smartphone I think that if we did split up she would still want me to play a full role in my daughter 's life , I am petrified , based both on her current behaviour at times , and the typical reaction of the rejected BPD , that she would attempt to poison my daughter against me in any way she could , and possibly try to block access to my daughter for other members of my family by preventing me from taking my daughter out of the country where we live even for holidays
1	The other issue for me is the financial one , but that is another story for another day
1	Just to reiterate , when things are good , which they are around 50 to 60 of the time , I can not imagine ever wanting to be with another woman as she is everything a man could ever want in terms of her intellect , beauty , warmth , ambitions and general personality which I fell in love with , and still love so much
1	It ' s just that my energy to deal with the bad episodes wears thinner and thinner with each one , to the point that I am terrified that one day I will just snap and hit her , which would of course be a total disaster
1	Not sure where to go from here , but sadly unless she admits that there is a problem I really do not want to spend the rest of my life in this Jekyll and Hyde relationship
1	i think i will see if the doctor will put me in the hospital and find out exactly what is wrong
1	i m afraid to go to the hospital they may not let me come home
1	i guess we are not going to have christmas it is suppose to be raining turning in to sleet one weather said it might snow
1	some days i sleep all day and all night with out waking up
1	I hope all of you are doing good
1	i tried to write to you a private letter but it said it was blocked
1	mym niece let the deserted cat in tonight when she got home from walmarts
1	he did not want to leave he is asleep in her chair , he is so sweet but he bites some times
1	i love you i m scared
1	I recently moved out to my own place 5 months ago
1	As a 22 year old , my BPD is likely peaking at least I hope this is the peak
1	I have been in a new relationship , as well , which has tested my selfsoothing skills completely and even helped in my improved skill set
1	I have never received therapy due to lack of insurance , but I follow DBT almost religiously and have been working hard on my own to develop these skills
1	With a full time job , I do n't have a lot of down time , so my evenings are usually spent laying in bed on my phone or crying when I 'm not spending time with my significant other
1	I have piles of clothes , makeup , and other messes around my bedroom that have been ignored simply because of my lack of functionality during these trying episodes
1	I take a low dose painkiller when I am in a situation that absolutely requires my presence and attention
1	I consider myself a highly capable individual and most of my worksocial success rides on my being 100 accountable mentally
1	Does anyone have any tips or personal ideas they can share in regards to how they overcome the trials of frequent episodes
1	We 've always known it would be , and always have threatened it only , we 've stayed together   continuing to try , I feel , out if pity
1	I was dx'd with MS 2 yrs after our marriage at age 31
1	He has gotten really nasty these past few days by depleting our joint savings which pays for my car payment , disconnected out Internet so I can only use my phone which he says will run out too
1	Calls me stupid and makes me feel like a complete lesser human because I am unable to work and use other ppls resources as he says
1	He is military , has always been with me out if pity and never really had a relationship so I know this has got to end now
1	I 'm just to the point of what should I do
1	Luckily , he has never wanted children and hates them
1	He hates people actually so , we just need to separate
1	He thinks I 'll due in a sink hole or something without him
1	Like I have not lived a life before him
1	He wants to see a lawyer for a postnuptial so I can not take him for alimony or pent ion , but we have n't been married long enough for that to happen
1	I lived on the opposite coast for my family and I do n't want to BE with my family
1	My young friend has just lost his right leg in a traffic accident
1	He was a keen footballer and very active before his amputation which happened about 6 weeks ago
1	He s been angry and shouting so the doctors put him on antipsychotic medication and diagnosed him paranoid schizophrenic , in fact that was the only information given about him on his discharge letter
1	Nothing about how to manage his wound , a suitable exercise program or his physiotherapy requirements
1	I d like to point out , at this point he lives in India , and has been recieving treatment in the government hospital
1	There is no support , advice or education after discharge , he came home today without even a crutch
1	He is suffering lots of side effects from this risperidone tablets , i think maybe its better to stop them and allow him some time to adjust to the shock of his loss and let him express his anger without being doped up
1	I m looking after him in my house so feels hugely responsible for his welfare
1	Hi guys , I 'm releatively new to this forum , and I came across it in an effort to try to resolve some terrible issues in my lifeI'm sure this will be somewhat long , but I want to give you a good idea of what 's tearing at meI am a 43 yr old F , that has had a relatively rough lifetimeI was adopted at 7 by a family that I thought would wantlovedesire meAs I grew up , I realized that that was not the case , and I guesss you can say , I never bonded with themI always felt like a 3rd WheelI grew up , had 2 girls and ALWAYS tried to do the best I couldEach challenge was a struggle
1	Back in 91 my father had passed away , and my mother had asked me to move up next to her in the spare house they hadI did , to save on rent , be next to her , just whateverOver the years , quite often I ran into financial hardships being a single mothre w2 kids , paying bills , groceries , etcAnd over the years my mother has helped me out with that as she financially could money was not a problem or issue when I was growing up , and even nowfor my motherSo , each time I ran into an issue she would offer to help , and I let her helpWell , onto the hardest part and latest thing that is just ripping me a part is , approximately 34 months ago I was dx'd with MS A TRUE SHOCK AND SCARY CONCEPT FOR ME
1	As it 's gon na be ME that this disease will eat up and spit out From the absolute beginning she has REFUSED to acknowledge that Yes , I have MS , and that in the short time of Dx , it 's eatentaken ALOT away from what used to be me
1	Steady walking , cognigtive issues , just whateverthe Dr 's figured I 've had it about 1520 yrs , so it 's almost reaching it 's max now , she just will not beleive that I have MSRecently I lost my job due to doing something really stupid at work , and since then things with my mother have gotten TERRIBLE AND OUT OF PROPORTIONAfter she found out I was laid off , she has turned ABSOLUTELY COLD AND DISREGARDING
1	Now , my mother and I have not always been very close , as I said I never really bonded with her growing up and she kinda made it clear to me that she never bonded with meShe really was'nt ever a very loving mother , growing upBut , after losing my job , she has gone to be just terrible with meShe knows I was struggling financially before losing my job , and since all this happened she has told me that she regrets EVER adopting me because I 've been such a screw up to her over the years , a disgrace in her eyes , tells me that how me having MS messes up her lifeOh really , what about my life
1	, she has told me that she DOES NOT care what happens to me , and does not want me in the house next to her , as I am nothing but a failuredisgrace and I ruin her image in the community which has been HUGE to her over the yearsalways saying What will the neighbors thinkShe knows I was struggling with the utilitiesgetting meds or whatever , and now that I 'm unemployed it 's 100x 's harderworseAnd she has screamed at me that she will not help or bail me out anymoreShe told me that she does not care whether the utilities get shut off and I freeze or whateverShe does'nt care if I have food or notAnd said she could give a   if I have my meds or notBasically she has saidshe could care less if I end up on the streets
1	This is also a woman that threw the Xmas presents I managed to get her , back at me and said I do n't want anything from youTake em back and get your money backI told her I NEED my meds and that I do n't have the money for the copay 's , I have'nt gotten groceries since Thanksgiving , just really in a bindObviously I am not gon na be able to maintain the utilities here , and it 's a matter of time before they get shut offIn talking with people at Public Assistance , tehy said due to the huge amount of people applying lately , it 'll be about 34 weeks before I get anythingI guess what is just tearing me up is HOWWHY
1	How is it and why would she care less if I ca n't walk due to Ms , and say I do n't care if you end up on the streetsHow do you say , You think I 'm a disgrace , and that you regret adopting me
1	How you could careless if I have anything to eatJust basically that she cares about me as much as you would the trash along the curb
1	Yet , this is a woman that is very active in the community , almost perfect in the eyes of the community , that has more money then she knows what to do with , always worries what everyone else will think , but could give a rat 's furry a about her daughter with a debilitating disease , could care less if she is homeless , whateverTalk about what the neighbors will think
1	What will they think when they realize she 's done that to her own familyHow could a mother do that to a daughter
1	I guess I just do n't comprehend thatI want to tell herto have her seethat I am NOT a screw up cuz I have MS , I 'm NOT a disgrace , I 'm NOT a lousy personpeice of
1	I may have screwed up over the years as we all do , that I may have turned to her to help me out when I was behind the 8ball she would offer to help out , so I would acceptbut that how in God 's name can you allow someone you claim as a daughter to go without food , MUCH NEEDED MEDS , heat , shelter , whatever
1	I TRULY need to get my MS meds refilled as I do n't have the money for the copays , so I have nt been able to get them and BOY OH BOY is my body paying for it , The pain is unique to say the least
1	2 of the meds I need are for helping me to walk better , and not have leg spasms that prevent you from standingwalking , whatever1 med is for my heart , and 2 other one 's are to assist the other meds for painCuz I 'll tell ya thisMS IS A VERY PAINFUL DISEASE
1	It 's like I want to say to her , OK , I understand not helping with the heat and all , I guess , but how and why in God 's name would you let me go without food or meds
1	And tell me you want me out of my house and do n't care where I end upSo , guys , I 'm hoping ANYONE of you guys can give me an insight as to why she 's being this wayor what I could try to doI just ca n't beleive all thisHow she can be so cruelheartless , whateverThinking and telling me I 'm a disgracea screw up , just whateverSo , if ya can guys , give me an insightsomething that 'll make me feel a tad better insideAnd NOT WANT TO END IT ALL
1	So I 'm looking forward to your helpTHANKS
1	I went to the doctor last week for severe shoulder pain
1	They did an Xray and called to schedule another to confirm a nodule on my lung
1	The second Xray confirmed several nodules on my lungs
1	I do not know how many , the sizes , or if they are bilateral
1	The PA who saw me was not forthcoming with information , and I could sense that she had her reasons for that , so I did not press
1	Now , however , I am going out of my mind with fear and worry
1	I can not concentrate on anything , and my arm is making it very difficult to distract myself with my typical daily tasks
1	She said that for insurance to cover it , the radiologist would have to request the CT andor other tests , but that she 'd put a rush on it
1	I 've had a cough for a couple years , but not from my nlungsmore a feeling in the back of my throat , like a ticklealmost like strangling
1	I was a smoker until I got that phone call to scedule a 2nd Xray
1	I wear a step2 patch daily for work , only smoking first thing in the morning and in the evenings after work , so I have n't been a heavy smoker in years
1	I have pretty much convinced myself that I 'm doomed
1	I 'm 13 years old , and I 've always been a relatively popular , happy girl
1	But this year , my parents have started fighting a bit , and ever since , I 've been very unhappy
1	I always think that life seems bleak and that I am a worthless person , and I 'm always putting myself down and thinking how ugly I am
1	I cry all the time and have been yelling and snapping at my friends and family a lot more than normal lately
1	I either sleep too much or too little , and I never want to wake up
1	I 've gained ten pounds since the beginning of this school year
1	I just do n't know what to do , I 'm so stressed and sad all the time
1	My mom has severe depression , so it runs in our family
1	I also started cutting myself in August
1	I know I should n't , and I had stopped for about a month but I got really upset and started again
1	I know I need help , I just do n't know how I could possibly tell anyone
1	Is my niece being molested by her dad
1	I always keep my niece who is about to be 4 years old every other weekend
1	i noticed on her last visit she was saying things likeshake your naked booty and she would shake her butt
1	i havfe a 3 year old daughter that she play with and they thought it was funny
1	then , later I was watching tv in my living room and my bedroom is off of that room
1	i could her the kids playing in my room
1	i all of a sudden her my niece jumping on my bed saying shake my naked butt , look at my naked booty then my 3 year old yelled ill that s nasty
1	so i got up to see what was goin on and she was jumping up on the bed bending over pulling her panties down showing her butt to my 3 year old makeing the above commentsi told her to stop that that was in apporperiate behavior
1	I informed her parents they could believe it and said they would talk to her
1	i also talked to my 3 year old
1	so the next time i was to keep her i could n't do to me having to go out o town
1	that sunday my nieca nd her dad camre over for dinner
1	after a while my niece and my daughter were back in my room playing while us adults watch a movie
1	i over heard my niece tellmy daughter to clos the door
1	then i thought let me open this door
1	they could be messing in my things
1	as i went to the door i hear me niece say touch it right there , put your finger there
1	I pushed the door open to find my niece had took all her clothes off and was laying on the bed with her legs cocked wide open and my daughter standing there as if she was about to touch her
1	i told him and he stood in the doorway for like 10min in a daze
1	i asked him what s wrong with you he said
1	he never said anything to his daughter like that not good what you did or anything
1	i took both girls to the side and talked to them
1	explain the best way i could to a 3 and 4 year old that
1	that behavior is inapporperiate and i began to ask them about good touches and bad touches
1	something that i have practice with them since they were two years old
1	my daughter said no to all my question
1	but my niece shooked me when she stated my dad touches me all the time
1	i have know her father for yearss , but that did n't stop me from contiuing my question
1	at first she didn , t want to tell me
1	she dropped her head and began shaking it back and forth as if she could n't tell me
1	when i explain she could trust me andi would protect her
1	she went on to tell me that he touches her with his finger and stating i do n't like it when daddy touches me andshe compared it to him touching her mom
1	he uses his mouth on mommy booty
1	she also stated that he makes her touch him and i asked where and she pointed to her cooty area
1	after i had a more intense talk with her explaining it not right for daddy to do that and i gon na help you
1	i did n't know what to do my emotion wre everywhere
1	what i did was tell her dad that i talk to ther girl about good touches and bad touches and exlain that she said she see him touching her mom
1	he just thanked me
1	this situation worried me so the next day i decided that my nieces mother and father come over so we can talk about what happened and i felt the need to inform them of what i knew and that its a problem that needs to be delt with
1	so i called my nieces mom and after two days i got her
1	i asked if my nieces father had told her what happened on sunday and she said no , he did n't tell me anything
1	i thought that was strange he did nt tell her someting so important and he never said anything to his daughter about her action being wrong or inapporperitate
1	so i m wonder if my niece is being molested by her dad
1	I 'm 44 and have been married 23yrs , we 've been together 28 we were high school sweethearts started dating me 16 her 15 , she is all I 've ever known
1	We have a 19yr daughter and our son will be 17 our marriage has been nothing but a loveless one for along timeI hate to say this if it was n't for my son I think we wouldve ended it 16 yrs ago
1	I used to tell my wife that I loved her several times a day and she would say it back out of being courteuos but never has my wife told me she loves me , we never have any type of affection I have nt really kissed my wife in at least 45 years
1	there is no passion nothingSex is once every 23 months and is basically a chore for her
1	we have never gone away just the two of us , I 've asked and there is always a excuse or its with the kids
1	She blames me for everything in the marriage
1	we live like roomates and will go weeks not really talking
1	every time I think about getting a divorce I feel guilty
1	I look at all the pictures in the house and all we have togethernice house , yard etc all the time invested , and think do I want to loose all this , but is material things worth a rest of my life being unhappy
1	I do n't think we can continue like this
1	I see 2 counselors and both think it 's time to move on , because this has gone on for years
1	I love my wife and always will but that IN LOVE feeling is gone and she says she loves me and does nt want a divorce cuz it will mess the kids up for life and she 's proud that we 've been together this long when people comment
1	I was a severely abused child raised by two BPD parents
1	At sixteen I was made a ward of the court removed from my home to live in a halfway house
1	I spent years in therapy and have done remarkably well according to myself and my therapists
1	As I was warned I would do I married my father figuratively We had my daughter when I was 21 and split when I she was 2
1	I suspect my ex , her father was also BPD at the very least he had extreme anger issues
1	My daughter lived through my crazy years
1	She went to live with her father at 12 and came back to live with me at 18 when her brother was born
1	They are 18 years apart
1	I moved out of town when she was 12 to work and to work on myself
1	We remained close over the phone and extended visits over the holidays
1	My daughter has had extreme anger issues since she was small
1	She is venomous when she gets angry and get into fights
1	The main reason she lived with her father was because i could n't control her
1	I knew it would be worse as she got older , and it was
1	I got to be her confidant
1	She shares things she would never share with her father
1	I do n't fight with my daughter
1	I never treat her the way she treats me
1	I split up with my son 's father as well he abandoned us and raised my son alone until he was15
1	He got a scholarship to a school where my daughter lives and has been living with her for the past 2 years to attend school
1	I was a different person when raising him
1	My daughter is extremely jealous of him
1	He is focused on school and tennis , he is sociable but not a party boy
1	She has created dangerous and dramatic situations in her life and lives a Ghetto lifestyle even thought she has never lived in the Ghetto she comes from a middle class background
1	My daughter is now attacking me and my 90 yr old mother
1	One day we are all fine , the next we are dead to her and she never wants to speak to us again
1	She has 2 children of her own now
1	The father of the 13yr old abandoned them when my granddaughter was 2 she has attached to my daughter 's current boyfriend of 4 yrs
1	The new boyfriend is from the Ghetto and tolerates my daughters abuse because she owns everything and he owns nothing
1	My daughter is often verbally abusive to her children and her partner over little and big things but her anger is over the top no matter what
1	She humiliates her daughter posting their spats on Facebook
1	She says absolutely horrible things to whomever she is angry at in a fully equipped foul Ghetto mouth
1	I realize she must be angry about things from her childhood
1	I am willing to help her work with them i just do n't know how to approach her nor how to guide her when she is so angry with me
1	Last Friday we were cool , today she hates me
1	I love her and I want to help her and I do n't want to loose her
1	I am worried about my grandchildren
1	I am wounded by her words
1	I can imagine how they feel
1	She is blaming me , I feel responsible
1	and of course this is bringing up my stuff , but I am doing surprisingly wellfor now
1	I am 19 turning 20 soon I 'm disclosing my age because I know that many BPDlike symptoms are associated with adolosence and that adoloscents tend to grow out of theseI have , and continue to , struggle with these symptoms
1	I always assumed I struggled with depression
1	When I was younger , I was fearful of telling my mom my feelings because I felt that she would laugh at the thought of me thinking I had depression
1	I was fearful of telling anyone else because I thought they would either label me as crazy for having suicidal thoughts or would not understand
1	I go through periods when I am very happy with my life , when things seem to be going well
1	Then , one small thing or a few small things that are negative will happen and I am plunged into feelings of intense sadness , emptiness and a feeling of being alone as well as feelings of feeling lost and confused as to who I am or what I 'm doing with my life
1	Ever since I was a young child I can remember having feelings of loneliness although I have never been truly alone
1	I always had a family that was loving and I always had friends that I could rely on
1	However , even as a young child I recall feeling bouts of loneliness mixed with extreme sadness and confusing and conflicting thoughtsI felt very empty and alone but I did n't know why , I wanted something but I was n't sure what exactly I wanted
1	As I got older , I began to experience attacks of some sortI get feelings of extreme sadness and depression where I will cry uncontrollably and feel like my life and existence is going out of control
1	I scratch at myself and my thoughts seem to come in fragments and I feel unreal
1	I feel as if I do n't exist or that nothing makes sense and the world has become skewedlike I 'm in a dream or in some kind of weird foglike state
1	I often feel suicidal during these attacks , and I think about killing myself and it feels extremely rational when I 'm in that state
1	I feel crazy and like everything is coming apart and like my existence is falling apart and like nothing makes sense
1	These attacks are not necessarily triggered by something bigsometimes the thought of many of my friends being out and having fun will lead to me to have these bouts
1	I used to go on frequent alcoholic binges although I stopped recently I have n't had a drink in 5 months because it was getting out of control
1	Although I think about having drinks sometimes , I have been able to restrain myself
1	Other issues and thoughts that I have dealt with that lead me to believe that I might have BPD are my relationships with others
1	For many years I have felt like I needed to find a true love in my life to unload my emotions on , to rely on and to love me and care for me
1	I have felt like if I had just one person in my life who loved me intensely , with all their heart , that I would then be relieved of my problems and my depressive thoughts
1	As well , although I have several close friendships with others , I always have the fear that I will be one day left alone
1	Sometimes I push them away by rejecting invitations or by being distant but then eventually feel starved and like I need them so much
1	As well , when I am attracted to someone I tend to think about them nonstop , obsessively almost
1	I find it is hard to get over my attractions to men because I think about them all the time many times not on purpose , thoughts about them will just pop into my head and I have this hope that maybe they 'll like me if I change for them
1	I know in my mind it 's not rational , but I still tend towards this type of thinking
1	I just wanted to know if those of you who were diagnosed with BPD can say that my thoughts and feelings are similar to what you experience or whether you think that I might have BPD
1	I know that I need to seek help and I want to seek help although I still need to overcome my fear of the stigma associated of having this type of disorder
1	10 minutes later something can set him off and he 'll be miserable and angry for several hours
1	3Very low self esteem 4 When my mom finally threatened him for divorce , my dad looked desperate to stay in the relationship , which came as a huge shock to me being that he is always degrading my mom and speaking terribly of her and her family to me behind her back and often to her face
1	Why does he so want her so badly all of a sudden
1	7 He is very controlling 8 He has bad social skills 9 He does n't get along with his boss at all 10 I feel really bad writing these things about my father , but I feel like at this point in my life , I 'm entitled to know if and what kind issues he has
1	I have a 10 year old little boy who at the age of 3 went through a very traumatic circumstance and was a victim of physical and emotional abuse
1	He was taken from me for a year and a half and has undergone individualfamily therapy since than
1	I want to do whatever necessary to help him have a better future and a better life as a child but I do n't know where to start since I am not a therapist
1	I do not want him to go to therapy unless he is repressing what happened to him
1	I would just like opinions on what I can do to help him
1	He is saying things at school with reference to his teacher that are not appropriate , he is constantly getting into fights with the other kids , and he is always being teased
1	He is very clingly as a result of what he went through and anyones advice is greatly appreciated
1	I just do n't know how to help him and I want for him to be a happy normal , functioning child and part of society
1	I have borderline personality disorder , bipolar I disorder , anxiety disorder , and sleep disorder
1	I want to stop taking all my medications   lamictal 200 mg , trazodone 50100 mg , birth control
1	I do n't take it daily and am not addicted
1	My doctor said that my liver disease can not be reversed but I read online that it is possible with a healthy diet and life style to reverse or at least shrink some of the fat
1	So I want to eliminate all medications , chemicals , everything I can so I have a chance at reversing or improving my condition
1	I 've been on and off medication for over a decade
1	I 've been taking it for 4 years
1	Last time I was off my medication , I ended up in a forced stay in the psychiatric ward due to self harm
1	I 'm in a much better place in my life right now
1	I have stress and depression due to my financial situation and have been in bad health this past year from ear infections twice , sprained ankle , pulled muscle abdomen hip and lower back , stomach bleeding gastritis , and liver disease
1	I do n't feel suicidal and have n't done any self harm in many months
1	I 've been to 12 doctor appointments in the past three weeks from the gyno ER to gyno to primary to physical medicine to primary to ER to primary and tomorrow will be the gastroenterologist
1	Then I have to do physical therapy twice a week for my pulled muscle and muscle spasms or whatever is going on with my body
1	I 'm scheduling my DBT individual and group as soon as I get my physical therapy appointments scheduled in
1	I 'm not taking them everyday
1	but I have to start working tomorrow and will have to take them
1	I 'm hoping that physical therapy will work quickly and my gastritis will heal so I do n't have to take any pain medication
1	Were you able to completely stop your meds
1	I 'm meeting with my psychiatrist soon and will talk to him about lowering my dosage and discuss possibly stopping all medication , with exception of xanax , as needed
1	I 've been told by different psychiatrists and psychologists that I have to be on medication the rest of my life and continue therapy
1	I 'd rather risk dealing with my mental illness issues than to risk damaging my liver any more
1	I 'm really scared that I 'm going to harm my liver
1	And yes , I know it takes time for this to happen but I am only 31 years old and have liver disease
1	I 've been eating healthy with exception of milk and soda and was exercising regularly until I hurt my ankle and other pulled muscle and gastritis issues the past 6 months
1	I know I should n't have been drinking at all with my medication and mental condition
1	I 'm trying to remain hopeful that I can go medfree and be able to manage my depression
1	I do n't mind my mania except for insomnia issues
1	Hubby was never home when he was in town , and in Mexico fishing
1	I personally went thru some traumatic times in the past 5 years also
1	My parents passed away , lost my job of 18 years , one of my closest friends died , and I had 3 beloved dogs pass too
1	  I told him I wanted a divorce back in 2009 , but he told me he loved me and we could work things outthe usual   and surprise
1	things were good for a month and then right back to normalwhere I was obviously invisible
1	So yesterday , we went to the paralegal and got things rollingno fightingwhat so ever   we almost got along there better than we normally do
1	And the thing is , I am not one to cry   but I am
1	I 've spent the past 5 years alone or so it seemedeven though we lived in the same house   I am questioning myself if this divorce is the right thing , I am questioning as to whether he agreed for my sake , I feel like I do n't have a support systemprobably because I do n't
1	Over the years he made sure I did n't have friends   everyone hated himblah blah blah   I do n't even have anyone to visit to share a cup of coffee with and get out my feelings   so nowI have to rehab a house so I can move into it and I 'm feeling overwhelmed with that thought even though I know exactly what needs to be done and I have the money to contract it out
1	I sound like I 'm talking in circles does n't it
1	I apologize   but it is just the way I 'm thinking now
1	I 'm 17 years old and i think i may have depression
1	I have felt like i may have for the past few months and even my family have noticed
1	My sleeping patterns have changed a lot recently , i always wake up in the night something i never used to do and i have the same reoccurring dream where both my parents and siblings die
1	I find i wake up every morning tired and struggle to get the motivation to get up for the dayi promise i 'm not just being lazy
1	I horse ride very competitively and until recently dreamt of doing it professionally , i use to love competing and look forward to each event
1	Now i just do n't enjoy it at all , i never look forward to it and subsequently i do n't get very good resultsupsetting me even more
1	I do n't want to simply give it up as until the past few months i loved it and it was my favourite thing
1	I feel awful because my parents put so much time and effort into it and i feel like i am just wasting it
1	My performance at school is also slipping , which considering how close we are to exams is an issue
1	Getting low grades and constantly feeling like failure is what i think may be the cause of my feelings
1	Its a vicious circlethe worse grades i get the more guilty and worthless i feel the less i can concentrate and work in order to improve my grades
1	I have a good group of friends however i never talk about feelings with them and i always act like the easy going not caring kind of person when in fact i could n't be more opposite
1	I find it so hard to express my actual feelings to people , however i am also completely confused about why or how i truly feel
1	I do n't understand why i should feel like this , i have good family , friends , lifestyle , if i just actually stopped feeling sorry for myself and did some work i could get better grades
1	I feel completely trapped within my head , i do n't want to feel like this yet i ca n't seem to snap out of it
1	I go to school each day and act happy and care free , i exercise regularly and i have good friends , other people have way worse things happening to them so i do n't understand why i feel like this , it seems stupid
1	Hi all , I posted the following in the Neurology forum but now since it seems to be a stressdepression issue , I am posting here in the hopes that someone else might be or has experiencing what I am
1	I am a 41 year old female with no significant past medical history
1	For the past 3 months I have been suffering from lip tinglingnumbness , mostly the left lower lip along with my tongue being numb
1	A few weeks after the mouth symptoms , my hands started to get pins and needles
1	First one side , then the other now it can do it simultaneously but this is n't constant some days they do n't go numb
1	My B12 however was 260 which is in the low normal range
1	I just had another blood work up that is going to check into that further as well as some other more detailed test although I 'm not sure what they are called
1	I do have one tooth that needs a crown but the dentist did n't feel it would cause my symptoms
1	I was getting daily headaches but that seems to have subsided , they are now only occasional
1	Yesterday , I had an EMG done and those results were also normal
1	I have extreme fatigue but yet I am not sleeping well and I used to be a champion sleeper
1	I may have some slight depression since I am coming up on the 1st anniversary of my brothers death
1	His death has affected me greatly but since I 've never had depression I 'm not sure if I do now
1	I have been seeing a therapist for the last month or so
1	My first neurologist prescribed Cymbalta 60 mg daily , Rozerem and Fioricet
1	I need to take 2 Fioricet 's to make any headaches go away but I find that taking two will make me extremely tired
1	As far as the Cymbalta , I do n't feel any different mentally but I 'm not sure what I 'm supposed to feel
1	I do work in a stressful job and for the past year have had many additional stressors
1	Yesterday the neurologist also prescribed Neurontin 300 mg so I will have to see what , if any , effect that will have
1	Right now they are going with stressdepression since everything else indicates I am very healthy
1	Of course , I am grateful for all the negative test results but I ca n't stand another minute of these liptongue symptoms
1	His dad and I have been separated since he was 20 months
1	My ex is hands on dad and we 've been sharing custody for our son but recently my son told some disturbing things his stepmom has been saying to him
1	She once had a fight with my ex and threatened to stab him and she repeatedly said to my Ex that   he should do her a favour and leave with his house and take his son with him my son heard the threats and according to my son he say the step mom threatening to stab his dad and police wee called by the neighbors
1	They went away for New Years with my son and their 3 yr old daughter but to my surprise my son came back home after the break and told he never wanted to go back as he was left to sleep with strangers as his step mom sent him off to spend a night with strangers as her , his dad and their daughter spent a night in a diffrent hotel room
1	I was so hurt but when I contacted the dad he denied it
1	He 's also still defending his wife after the knife incident
1	I 've now stopped from taking our son to his house but am hurting as a mother cos my son is hurting cos he really missed his dad
1	I asked the dad to find ways of spending time with his son without his wife as am no longer comfortable sending my son to their home but he keeps taking him there
1	I feel she no longer wants anything to do with my child
1	Please help he threatening to take me to court and bullying me

1	Alright , so I 've been in therapy for 13 years , and I 've been getting meds for 9
1	I 'm currently 24 , and I 'll be 25 next week
1	I first used pot when I was 18 , but did n't use regularly till I was 20 , and stopped completely 2 months ago
1	I also made promises that I intend to keep
1	Before I stopped , I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder , and was put on several medications to control my hallucinations , as well as remaining on antidepressants
1	I was mainly told I was hallucinating because I smoked marijuana , and that if I stopped , the hallucinations might stop
1	Also , I was told the use of pot would interfere with the function of my antipsychotics
1	So , after a runin with the police whereby my pipes were confiscated , I decided I 've had enough
1	I expected the hallucinations to continue during the month that I was off of the substance , due to the length of time it takes for a regular user 's body to cleanse itself of THC
1	My meds are changed from Loxapine 30 mg , Effexor 300 mg and Seroquel 300 mg to Saphris 10 mg and the same amount of Effexor , because I had been rapidly gaining weight with no change to my diet and exercise
1	I did n't start hallucinating until about two weeks into the quitting process , and the hallucinations continued well into the second month , at which time I began getting headaches
1	I also can hardly eat , as every time I put something in my stomach I suffer from severe nausea
1	My meds are changed again , because I tell my doctor the saphris is making me physically ill and the effexor is not helping at all in stabilizing my mood
1	He puts me on latuda 40 mg and takes me off of effexor by giving me pristiq , the active ingredient in that med being a metabolite of venlafaxine so that I might escape the brunt of withdrawal from such a high dose of effexor
1	At this point I can no longer fall asleep in a dark room , or even spend time in one , due to severe hallucinations gathering shadows , figures in my peripheral vision , flashes of light , fractal patterns
1	At no point in my current hallucinations do I hear anything out of the ordinary
1	I describe my hallucinations to my psychiatrist , who says he wants to up the dose of my latuda to 80 mg
1	He also says if this med does n't work , he has nothing left to try and I 'm no longer under his care
1	I can no longer look at other people unless they 're in a welllit area , otherwise their faces transform and they appear no longer human
1	At this point I ca n't recognize my face in the mirror unless I have the bathroom lights on , even during the day with natural light coming in through the window
1	I tell my doctor about this , and he suddenly decides that my hallucinations are n't psychiatric in nature , which is why his meds are n't working
1	He suggests that I 've been taking hard drugs , as lingering chemical activity from such substances would definitely cause the hallucinations I 've been describing
1	He also says the hallucinations may be caused by a mass in my brain
1	I schedule an MRI for the following week , which would be this week
1	I 'm still taking my meds , still hallucinating
1	However , the headaches have progressed from a simple pressure with minor pain , to a stabbing in my meninges that gets progressively worse over 15 minutes and then goes away for an hour , only to come back when I think it 's over
1	Not as bad as a migraine , but what I neglected to mention is that none of the headaches I 've experienced over the past month are affected by painkillers
1	I think I 'm in the middle of an emergency situation , so I go to the ER
1	I describe my troubles to the ER , who schedule an emergency MRI , along with some urine and blood screening
1	Blood and urine come back clean , no residual THC or evidence of any other drugs , nor is there evidence of a cancerous mass in my blood
1	No evidence of ANY sort of mass in my brain , nor is there evidence of lingering chemical activity from hard drugs , which would really have surprised me if I had actually been doing any in the first place
1	I 'm told I 'm not hallucinating , that what I 'm seeing are merely peculiarities of my sight
1	This does n't explain the colors I see when I close my eyes , the moving points of light I see when I look at any illuminated surface , the squirrel I saw running on the wall in my girlfriend 's bedroom that turns out to be a stationary dreamcatcher , or the severed head that was in my bed on Monday morning
1	The ER doc suggests I admit myself to the hospital so my meds can be adjusted
1	I tell him matteroffactly that I 've already been on every antipsychotic on the market and that nothing works anyway , or it causes negative sideeffects , like when my white blood cells were dropped from taking clozaril , or when abilify and geodon on separate occasions caused both tardive diskinesia and painful paralysis of my face and neck
1	I 'm scheduled to see my psychiatrist this Friday
1	He 's used to things he tries working eventually
1	However , nothing he 's given me so far has controlled my hallucinations or reduced my depression for more than 2 months at a time , so I 'm inclined to think I simply have an extremely resistant form of schizoaffective , as well as depression
1	Hey i m an 18 year old male a freshman in college 6 ' 1 155 lb
1	So i made some bad decisions during my first semester and begging of second by taking some mdma
1	The first time i took an E pill and was fine , the next weekend the second time i took about 253 g of Molly mdma powder form and felt great but the next morning when i walked outside i felt wierd and it was the first time i felt the pressure in the left part of my forehead like some took an ice cream scoop out of it
1	After a couple of days it got better and i waited a month and then i decided to take some Molly again after i had a mixed drink of alcohol , this time i took about 3 g and waited about 1520 minutes then took 2 more dabs of i would guess about 05075 g each
1	I waited and took about 4 big bongs rips out of my huge bong and i felt the molly hit me but then i started freaking out because i ca nt smoke a lot or i get really anxious or panic attacks in some cases
1	I did nt have a good roll and i just felt bad
1	I ended up not going out with my friends because my body was too hot and i did nt want anything bad to happen to me while i was out so i just chilled in some gym shorts and no shirt and drank some water
1	The next day i did nt feel to bad so i went out with my friends and got really drunk and my head was spinning and i stayed in throwing up
1	The next morning when i woke up i felt really really bad and the feeling in the left part of my forehead was there and i could tell something was off
1	When i walked outside i think i had a case of some derealization because everything seemed overwhelming and scary almost
1	I could nt figure out what was wrong and i was super anxious and depressed
1	The whole week and a half i felt awful and my forehead had that wierd feeling and it felt as though my head looked wierd in shape but when i looked in the mirror of course it was normal
1	Then one night i felt really wierd and terrible and was unxeplainbly crying and i called my mom to come get me and she took me home for the weekend and i got some rest and 5 htp and went back to school monday
1	I felt a little better with the 5 htp i was nt depressed
1	Its been a little over 2 months since i took the mdma and i still have that pressure in the left part of my forehead and it still kind of feels like my forehead looks wierd
1	I ve done a lot of research on this stuff and a lot of people say that it is the anxiety that is causing it because its still there but i do nt think so because i feel fine now and not anxious but the feeling is still there
1	The only other thing i could think is that my nerves are burnt out and in the re wiring process which is why my forehead hurts
1	I still drink on the weekends but i have nt smoked much and i ve been trying to keep that to a mininmum
1	I ve been eating healthy and working out and i feel that the feeling comes and goes away like ill feel better for a couple of weeks and then it will kind of be worse for a couple weeks but i can always tell that it is there even when i m feeling better
1	I m just hoping that this is nt Permanent and that it will go away some time soon as long as i do n't take any more mdma , which trust me i definetely wo nt do that
1	Thank You for comments they are much appreciated
1	I have finally moved from the town where my ex and his girlfriend lives and I feel goodI still have sad moments and the kids move out on Monday so we will see how I go on my own

1	I 'm sooo proudly the mother of a beautiful 14 year old daughter whom has many psychological problems
1	I know a lot of mental illness is hereditary so she 's getting double dosed if she 's by geneticly dealing w my mental illnesses also
1	She was traumatized on her 12th bday
1	But has always been a depressive person since that partiular day in her life she 's living w PSDOCDClinical Depression Bipolar sleep disorders
1	I personally believe she has BPD BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER as well as social anxieties , she does n't let anyone other than her boyfriend of a year , myself and sometimes her dad get close to her if she goes anywhere else including school she has severe panic attacks and she is a recovering ' cutter ' so that makes her self concious as well she fights the urges and I believe has cut recently it 's an addiction too not just part of her illness let me just say that her reason for being traumatized was never dealt w properly by the Authorities no consequences anyone else had to deal with or answer to as her mother , this is horrible because I know the depth of her pain
1	But we are not the same person and it 's not about me she sees a psycbiatrist and goes to counseling it seemed to help for a while
1	But as anyone who has been in this situation knows any little thing can trigger an immediate onset of emotional break downs and now I 'm thinking personality disorders as well bipolar has nothing on what I 'm seeing manifest in my daughter it was bad enough at one point that she also , was institutionalized yet I 'm afraid I 'm going to lose my baby girl if she does n't get peace of mind and it 's to the point where I 'm getting therapy and counseling also because I want her peace of mind at just about any cost ALSO
1	I 'm finding out after years that many of my psych issues have been due to thyroid disease what are the odds of her dealing w that also
1	I 'm 18 and have been suffering from a very complex depression
1	I have been diagnosed with Tourettes Syndrome , Generalized Anxiety Disorder primarily Social Anxiety , and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
1	I take Lexapro and Xanax as needed
1	I began selfloathing , my anxiety shot up , and there are a lot of poisonous ingredients to this depression that became very complicated
1	I eventually withdrew from school near the end of my senior year because it was tearing me to pieces
1	Right now i 'm at home trying to finish up two online classes that i need to graduate from this high school
1	My mind will often drain after only two problems on the homework depending whether it 's a good day or bad day
1	I am known as a borderline genius and semisavant and it 's been speculated i have Aspergers Syndrome but no diagnosis
1	All i want to do is have the ability to do what is necessary so i do n't waste my life away
1	It feels like my mind is basically destroying me
1	For example , i use to put my head in the freezer a lot almost habitually
1	That was when i was younger however but for some reason it seemed to calm me down
1	So for those of you that have read my previous post about my bf and his mom 's behavior towards him , I gathered that about half of you think it is odd , and half of you think its just overprotective parenting type of thing
1	If you have nt read it , it 's a long story to repeat , please read I think my bf may have been sexually abused as a kidand wo n't tell me
1	But anyways , the newest thing that I learned is this at his mom 's , when we go there together , we sleep in her bed and she sleeps on the couch there is no guest room or anything
1	But I found out last night that when he goes up there by himself , that him and his mom share her bed
1	Again , he is 25 years old
1	I know I sure as hell would not sleep in bed with my mom for a weekend or so at a timethat is just weird to me
1	I have tried talking to my dad , my aunt and her friend about it all in separate places at different times and they all think it is a bit odd
1	Again , I might be overreacting , but that 's what I 'm trying to figure out , because to me and both sides of my family , this is not normal
1	ps , if you have not read my original post , please do n't base an opinion off of just this one because there is more to it
1	I just was wondering why my Giant celled Tumor keeps coming back
1	The first time I had it taken out I was 19
1	But again 6 months later it came back so for the third time I had it taken out
1	things were looking good until 15 months later it has come back I am having it taken out next week , but will it last
1	I am finding that the more that they come back the more painful they are
1	Also when I was 8 years old I hit a brick wall with my bike and ripped my ring finger same one with the giant cell almost to nothing the bone was the only thing really left
1	Just really wondering if I am going to need to have this thing taken out every 6 months or will it stop soon
1	Recently I have protected sex with one of my friend
1	I used condom carefully and we had sex for about 5 min
1	When I going to release , I pull out from the viginal with condom protected
1	But after a few second I fail to hold it and I ejaculated a very small amount of sperm outside the viginal but still protected with condom
1	I never ever release inside the viginal even I wear condom because I want to be more extra safe
1	However , my penis become soft after I wore a new condom
1	I know this incident is not likely to get her pregnant but I not sure about this
1	I always practice extra safe even I wear condom
1	I have a young close relative , around 16 years old , boy , in high school , very smart , very handsome and healthy
1	All is very good with him except that he is very very stressful when it comes to studing , it is not that he is not smart or does not have good grades , he has excellent grades and he is probably very smart , but he seat all day long and learn and it cause him a lot of pain and agony and he is really suffering
1	I will just give one example   he can spend hours and days trying to understand something very very deep in the content that no one really excpect him to know but he just ca n't go ahead unless he understand it , he does not want to go out of his room even for family because he is so stressful
1	We have no experience with that , it is only when it is related with studing , besdie that all is good but he makes the studing the whole world for him
1	I would appericiate any advice from your experience
1	Thank you , Jack
1	If you spot my posts on other forums , I am trying to get as many varied responses as possible , so trying as many forums as I think might pertain to the issue
1	My cousin is almost 19 , and has been a rather depressed type of person pretty much his whole life
1	His upbringing was n't great , his parents have a very disagreeable dynamic , and divorced a few years ago , and both are with other people
1	His mother has her own domestic issues , and I guess his father probably does too
1	My cousin has been almost sort of fending for himself for some time now , he dropped out of school over a year ago
1	He receives money from both parents , and it is not the financial aspect he is alone on , but the emotional
1	He started to turn more to drugs , I do not know how long ago but all I know is that he does many different pills , and drinks
1	NOW , I am hearing for the last couple months he has been saying when he gets mad and throws his little tantrums He has developed into sort of a toddler , almost
1	he tells anyone off , cusses them out etc
1	And so many of his family members have heard him use suicide as a threat
1	Well now he has been saying recently , apparently , that he is going to take as many people as he can when he goes
1	Especially on a personal level considering I have been on his ' list ' for quite some time now Well , just yesterday the family catches wind that he has just bought a hand gun
1	And I am infuriated by the idea of considering I should fear for my own life , at the hands of some psycho that is my cousin
1	With the anger aside , I am just here to ask , what can I do
1	Is there any institutions Ohio area where you can forcibly emit a person on account of being a danger to himself and others
1	I know I have no proof of this , and the cops can do nothing
1	I do n't want to just sit back and wait for the day to come And I honestly feel as though my life , and those of my family members is truly in danger
1	I have a very complicated situation that I am finding difficult to sort through
1	I have been unhappily married for over ten years
1	My husband is significantly older than I am and was a person in a position of authority over me at a very young age
1	He made what were initially unwanted advances toward me when I was only 13 and because my home life was unstable emotionally abusive probably BPD mother , I did n't tell anyone and I substituted my feelings of him taking advantage of me and turned them into him loving me
1	He says he did love me and the fact that we are now married should be proof of that
1	I think this is probably true , but I still find it hard to move on given the way it happened
1	I am still very angry at him for what he did to me and I bring it up to him all the time , usually when we 're arguing
1	He is a very opinionated person and is what I interpret he disagrees as very critical and controlling
1	I find it hard to accept criticism from him it is always his way is the right way and often lash out at him because I feel intimidated by his opinionated nature
1	With him , I go between being passive and just trying to placate him and being aggressive and angry with him
1	I asked him to go to marriage counseling , which he halfheartedly participated in
1	He has taken it upon himself to diagnose me with Emotionally Unstable Personality disorder and says it is not a marriage counseling issue
1	I do n't agree with his diagnosis , but I can see a few criteria that apply
1	The traits that fit only fit with him and I do not exhibit these traits with other people in my life
1	I have many friends , I am very close to my family and I am a high functioning person
1	No one else in my life would even remotely feel that this diagnosis applies , and they were very puzzled when I even tried to ask if they thought I might fit the description
1	I feel like I am being manipulated by my husband and resent him on many levels however , if I do have EUPD then I do not want to be blinded by my anger at him
1	If I need help , I want to get it
1	1   my dad is dead he die from cancer
1	he had cancer nine years before he died

1	I have been this way for at least ten years I no , but I just realized it was a real problem about 3 yrs ago and it has gotten worst
1	I ca n't remember from one minute to the next
1	I have a had time moving further with anything , because I do n't remember things so I do n't have anything to build on
1	I want to say this I was molested when I was a child , I sometimes feel like I block things out with out realizing it , I did it as a child to be able to cope with the things that was being done to me
1	Now I am 45 yrs old and I am steel doing , I do n't do it intentionally I do n't know how to cut it off , it 's almost like I erase things as I go
1	I feel in some way it has affected my learning ability , or may its still due to me not being able to remember what I just learned
1	I have several degrees , I learn but I have a hard time applying what I learn because I just ca n't remember
1	Please help me if there is any Doctor out there that will help me to see what is going on in my brain , it is very frustrating and it has affected my whole life
1	I know that God has so much more in life for me to do than for me to be trapped in my mind of forgetfulness
1	I love to read and to read the Bible , sometime I just say to myself what s the use , you are not going to remember anything anyway
1	I 'm 19 , and I 'm currently in university and I work part time
1	I just got back from a much needed   vacation and I have really had enough feeling the way I do
1	I can never get answers from doctors because they just tell me it 's stress , how can I be stressed my entire life
1	Basically I think I need help , the closest thing I have it say is I think I 'm depressed and that I 've been depressed
1	Since I was maybe 14 I could remember
1	I had a lot of traumatic things Happen to me , involving homelessness , sexual and physical abuse from both strangers and family members
1	I have a very young mother who tries her best and always done her best and is still taking care of my little brothers
1	I just wish there was someone to help me , help my family
1	But I feel like I need to get outta this funk first
1	Some of the symptoms I have is that since I was at least 10 I always had bad dreams , and negative thoughts
1	I first noticed that when I was 8 I would always think of worst cases if I 'm in a car , or In a bad situation I imagine myself dying or myself accidentally killing someone else
1	And Immediately do n't feel afraid of the situation , even though I have night terrors every night , I enjoy sleeping
1	I feel it 's better than my own reality
1	Wo n't mention how , but I have a scar that goes along the vein on my left arm that I constantly lie about
1	And pills only made me sleep and left me very weak
1	I stopped eating last year , I have no reason I just feel grossed out by food I 'm lactose so there is n't much for me to eat n enjoy anyways , unless it was the right time or I starved myself for to long , 8 months ago my mother introduced me to feeling comfortable smoking weed , Which allowed me to eat but never helped get my appetite back and put my negative thoughts away for a few minutes
1	I feel like my mind is constantly telling me to give up , like subconsciously I do n't want to live but I almost feel like I have to
1	I do n't know how much longer I can fight myself
1	I love my family and everything they do , but I just ca n't help myself anymore
1	I 've contacted doctors and talk to people , I never tell them the intimates but it feel like reaching out is the first step , finding someone to listen and help is the beginning
1	I really appreciate you taking the time to read this
1	We recently spoke about saving for a home that we would purchase in the next 23 years I ask that a small portion of the child support be saved as well as portions of our own money
1	At first this plan was well received , then a few months later my wife did n’t want to follow that plan , stating we should save just our own money not any of the child support
1	At first I felt betrayed and wondered would all our agreed upon plans be subject to sudden change at her whim , or could it be that she felt that child support should not be on the table
1	So now I ’m wondering am I hill for asking , I just felt as though sense there three kid in the house that would not be out anytime soon , that it should be a part of our finances
1	When we married it was n’t an issue it seem it has become one , one that I really wish would n’t be
1	My son is grown and has been out my house sense before I married so it was just me
1	Now with a wife and three new kids , I ’m wondering where to draw my lines , and with income tax season coming , I find myself asking how that ’s going to work
1	In a 6 month period my estrogen level went from below 20 to over 2300
1	I am a ' healthy ' 53 year old female
1	I have been in menapause for 5 years
1	I have taken herbal supplement , Estroven since the beginning
1	A couple of years ago , I began using Estring 2 mg   which helped
1	I had my hormone levels tested in December and my doctor said they basically did n't even register
1	I would skip a day or two , then back on it , averaging everyother day
1	I then decided I would make a FAITHFUL effort
1	I called my doctor and asked if I could have my hormones retested
1	After 6 full weeks of DAILY FAITHFUL USE applied only to my hipsabdomen   and 6 months since my last blood test , my new estrogen level was 2,376
1	My doctor called and had me come in for an immediate ultrasound of my overies   NORMAL
1	I will have another blood test today
1	WHAT ELSE should I be concerned about here   and WHAT ELSE should my doctor be looking for
1	I just spoke to my doctor about starting Zoloft and I 'm so freaked out that I think I 'm going to lose my mind
1	First off I went through the horror of the Paxil withdrawals and I hear that Zoloft is also very hard to get off of
1	I seem to have issues with anxiety and depression and my doctor seems to think that this will help with both of the issues as Paxil seemed to
1	Here 's the catch though , when I was taking Paxil it totally killed my sex drive and made me very tired
1	I 've tried Wellbutrin for a while and it seems to make me very irritable and does n't help with my depression but when I took it with Paxil it did seem to keep my energy levels up
1	I keep hearing that Zoloft will make me tired and cause me to gain weight
1	I also hear that it seems to have the same sexual side effects that Paxil did even though it 's not as strong an SSRI as Paxil
1	I was just wondering if there was anyone out there who has ever tried the combination of Zoloft and Wellbutrin
1	I 'm really not in a good place in my life and I feel like I just do n't have time to keep trying medications that will put me to sleep
1	Right now I 'm taking Clonezepam for my anxiety and it totally puts me down for the count
1	I just seem to be very sensitive to all of the medications that I 've tried and if I ca n't seem to get the combination right then I 'll just have to try to work through these issues on my own without any help of antidepressants
1	So if there 's anyone out there who has ever been on the combination of Zoloft and Wellbutrin then please let me know how it worked and especially if they felt tired when they were on Zoloft by itself
1	I really feel like i 'm at the end of my rope
1	I was doing well for a while and then things everything just seemed to wear off and I feel like I 'm back at square one
1	Horrible anxiety and suicidal thoughts seem to be creeping back into my life and now that I 've got a taste of what it was like to feel a little better I feel even worse than I did before by comparison
1	Over the past 6 years High School I have accomplished next to nothing , when I leave all I will have is good ATAR
1	Once I was suggested to take out my anger on punching bags which I can neither afford nor can I take out 6 years and the rest of my life on
1	I do n't have the social skills I was supposed to learn from high school , the rest of my life is going to cop it for that
1	Any conversations I try to have with people are one sided , it 's only me doing the talking sort of thing , they generally want to just end the conversationleave as quickly as possible
1	I wish I knew why
1	Sometimes I wonder if I am retarded , at the point where I can only just not realise my retardedness
1	After much thought , I have deduced what I can do next
1	Kill myself as I 'll never get the social skills I need or be able to let go of the last 6 years
1	The only thing that 's stopped me so far is promising myself to kill everyone who has made this amount of time and therefore the rest of my life so   before I get to myself
1	I never used to be like that , it used to make me literally feel sick , now I just imagine the satisfaction and relief I 'd obtain
1	But I might just make the problem worse and never let go I actually killed
1	I could also just kill the   to hopefully make me feel better
1	I 'm only 16 so there would be a large search for me , and I would n't be able to just leave easily
1	By leave , I mean literally just pack up and go , just travel , hobo it around a bit because of my lack of money
1	But if I 'm going to kill myself and others if I do nothing this is a good choice
1	I do n't want to leave though , because my final exams are coming up soon , and I want to make sure I can at least go back to something if my life suddenly improves
1	Wells , my name is Barbara
1	19 years of age and expecting my very first baby
1	My baby 's dad and I have been together for only 7 months , and from the first time we met we wanted to have a kid together so badly , so we were ALWAYS trying
1	It was with him that I was actually able to post pictures on fb , bring him around my family , because every guy before him was just temporary in my opinion   It was the same treatment I got from him   So anyways , during the third month of my pregnancy my hours at work started to pick up and I barely had time for him
1	Oh yeah , I forgot to mention   he 's only 17   I started becoming too tired to drive or catch the bus to his house , or when he came over to mines I would always be sleeping
1	I guess he got tired of the fact that he was losing me to my job
1	I tried to explain to him that our daughter ai n't gon na be cheap and since I 'm the only one working in the relationship the more hours I got from work the more better it was for all three of us financially he could n't handle it anymore
1	He left me the day before we would've made a year and immediately found a girlfriend a week later   he does n't attempt to show up to any of my appointments no more , he 's never there for me when I 'm in the hospital laying in bed hoping and praying that nothing 's wrong with our kid   he says he 's going to be there for when his daughter is born and throughout her lifetime , but I do n't want him hurting her the same way he hurt me 3 every one tells me to put his   on child support , but I 'm afraid that if I do I 'll be arrested for RAPE   he 's no longer with the girl he left me for , but still wo n't try to work things out with me for the sake of our daughter
1	I 'm confused and scared of what the future holds for my daughter and I
1	I 'm a 15 year old girl and I think I may have depression , but I ca n't tell whether I 'm just jealous , bitter , sad , angry , helpless , tired and irritable all at onceand that 's not depression , surely   that 's just the average range of human emotion
1	I have felt so helpless over the past few weeks   and this may sound horrible   but I think I 've become this way because of other people
1	It 's not that they 're door anything to put me down , it 's just that they 're all so happy
1	They have successful relationships and plans for the future and bestfriends and things to do I just feel like I deserve that , do n't I
1	I feel like I 'm invisible I 've stopped eating often , I 've felt the urge to cut , I 've attempted burning myself with a lighter , I 've stayed away from social activities , I 've tried smoking and I 've cried for no apparent reason
1	I sound so bitter when I read this back to myself , but I feel I need to write about this or it will never go away
1	But , from my understanding of these things , they do n't justgo away
1	What worries me is that I 'm either seriously depressed and am brushing it off as a stupid phase , or that I am not depressed at all , but am just amplifying my situation
1	I do n't know if I 'm depressed and the only solid evidence that I am comes from the results of my online ' diagnoses '
1	In conclusion , I 'm not sure if this is a valid question , but , how do you tell if you 're truly , legitimately suffering from depression
1	Hello I have a penny sized lump on the top of my thigh
1	I went to my GP and I was really unsatisfied with the examination
1	She sent me for a ultrasound and the results determined there was not blood clot
1	I complained of frequent swelling of lymph nodes since last September in my neck , which come and go
1	I told her my concerns of it possibly being a lymph node but she gave me no response
1	Also I have no follow up , the nurse told me it was not a blood clot and sent me on my way ie
1	I am concerned and wonder why I have lymph nodes popping up in my neck and leg that come and go
1	I tested neg for Mono and recently Hiv
1	if it is a lymph node am I just more susceptible to swelling when I come in contact with everyday virusbacteria Also it does not hurt when I exercise legs or run so I doubt it 's a strain
1	I 've noticed it for a little less than 2 weeks now Thank you in advance also it is not harder and painless
1	My husband who was step father to my oldest 2 , and I started dating when I was 2 months pregnant with my oldest daughter and my son was 18 months old
1	I had 2 daughters with him but unfortunately my youngest 3 never got to meet her father as he was killed in a car accident 3 years ago , 5 days before she was born 7 weeks early
1	He always treated my oldest 2 like they were his own and a lot of people did n't know any different

1	I 'm James , fairly new here and to be honest I created an account in hopes that there would be someone else out there who could relate to my situation or could give me some beneficial advice
1	Feel free to be very open in your responses because I want an as honest opinion as possible
1	Just a quick background , I 'm 20 years old
1	I was diagnosed with ADD when I was in the 8th grade and tried quite an assortment of meds to tackle it in order to improve my behavior and grades in general
1	In the beginning of 11th grade I visited a new psychiatrist , since I had moved and needed a new prescription and he proceeded in reinforcing my ADD diagnosis , but also diagnosed me with oppositional defiance and manic depression
1	So far I 've only been taking Focalin XR since I first started meds back in 8th grade
1	Sadly , that psychiatrist was too expensive so we could n't continue , but I continued to take focalin until I graduated high school in 2011
1	I ended getting chartered out and recently moved back home where I 've been living with my parents and taking focalin 30 mg XR again
1	The reason I come to you all is because I feel as if I 'm slipping into something like psychosis
1	Previously when I stopped medication to join the military , I felt a hovering presence , like an alternate personality in the back of my head
1	Another version of me I guess you could say
1	I feel like a fake version of myself when I take my focalin
1	I want to be able to be successful by being me , not some dosed up version of what it makes me
1	An example would be me sitting somewhere and my mind will just turn off
1	I just stare like one of those creepy kids you 'd see in those old horror movies
1	I have small panic attacks or nerves that make me sweat and then I think about that sweat and sweat more
1	Then I wipe my face and sweat more thinking about how I might have to shake someone 's hand with my sweaty one
1	I 'm also feeling increasingly disconnected with my family and friends
1	I yearn social interaction , without it I linger in my own thoughts too long , but at the same time I just want to void myself and sleep until I can convince myself to get up
1	I 'm also just not content with who I am as a person
1	Sometimes I feel like my parents ca n't stand the person I really am and push the focalin on me , but I know that 's not true
1	Paranoid of them judging me by the way I act and as I spiral down it gets worseI've never told anyone any of this
1	People will think I 'm a psycho and cast that image upon me
1	Sometimes I get lost or confused in my thoughts and it makes it difficult for me to portray those thoughts
1	I did fine without the ADD meds in the military , I do n't think the issue is concentrating for school and such
1	If any of you have any advice you can offer please do
1	I promise I 'll answer them all as honestly as I can
1	Hi everyone , I do n't know how much more I can cope with all this , I have had problems all my life with pms sweating , mood swings depression anxiety the list goes on and on , had 3 children all born with problems harelip cleft palate , blindness in one eye and I kidney , since I have been diagnosed with hashimotos disease I have been reading a lot about it especially the pregnancy bit and the 3 main things for deformatives is the above ,
1	My concern is have I had trouble with my thyroid all my life and GPS have not picked it up
1	Stared on thyroxine 4 years ago and hrt , I do n't think the two like each other , hand combined tablets now have Merina coil fitted and on ostigel , if I take the two pumps of ostigel I go bonkers , and my thyroid levels drop
1	I am not sleeping , I am angry and anxious hot and sweaty , have no interest in anything , not worked for 3 years as I am always sick , does anyone have menopause and hashimotos , and can advise what next , if it was n't for my children I do n't think I would be here
1	I have read a lot about people and their treatment , but everything seems to be a few years old
1	I had my surgery in Jan radical neck and shoulder dissection
1	I have a beautiful scare on my neck and shoulder now
1	Moving my neck is very hard , but I am getting better each day
1	I had a port placed into my arm and that slowed me down just slightly
1	I will start tomorrow with interferon and will have to start off 5 days a week for 4 weeks , and then 3 times a week for 48 weeks
1	All my doctors say that I am doing great
1	I had my surgery on my left side and it has made me walk and sit uneven
1	Since I am uneven my right side has even become affected , because it has to make up for my left side
1	I tell you what the pain is n't fun at all
1	Hi i 'm a 17 year old girl
1	I 've lately had to undergo some therapy for depression , and I 've had a lot of memories brought back up
1	A lot of them have to do with my father whom I have a ice thin relationship with
1	Anyways when I was younger I had to live with my dad during the weekdays and my mom on the weekends
1	So I 've recently been starting to think if my father loves me too much
1	When i was younger he always wanted to be taking naps with me , I would either sleeping on his chest or next to him , he liked to hold me
1	He also use to cut my hair up until i was in 5th grade , he 'd make me strip of my clothes while he cut my hair
1	My dad is always telling me how much he loves me , he always wants to be near me , and is very possessive of his time with me
1	He 'll sometimes make comments on how big my butt or boobs are
1	He 'll even say that if he were my age he would love to be dating me
1	He always calls me his love
1	If I 'm trying to lay on the couch he 'll grab my ankles and lay them across his lap and hell stroke my legs
1	He always tries to bring sex up with me
1	He still comments that after a scary movie if i 'm scared i can come sleep in his room
1	When we go on vacations he 'll always get a king size bed , he says its big enough for us to share
1	he will sometimes will be trying to tickle me and he 'll always move toward my butt area
1	I once said i was too hot , and he said well do you have the hots for me He s always saying he loves me soo much
1	I do n't know maybe i 'm being paranoid , i 'm no expert but is any of this weird or
1	She did n't want to start me on it yet but I needed to be stable and said I would deal with the wait gain and complain later if I had too
1	The way I figure it is the zanex make me hungry anyhow so hopefully I wo nt be any hungrier and I 'm tiring to watch my weight
1	plus she gave me some klonopin also I was a wreak yesterday and it showed
1	I think I pretty much went through all the other anti anxiety meds there was
1	After taking zanex though for almost 4 years on pretty much a steady basis at 3 to 4 mg I 'm not sure the dose will work though
1	That s me self medicating over the years
1	I have n't told pdoc and I do n't exceed that dose cause its pretty much as high as they will go
1	But it will come in handy 4 sure I need something for my anxiety
1	Hope it lasts last time it did n't but I 'm praying I just want to be stable for me my kids and I want to go back to school and feel I ca nt being such a wreak all the time
1	I am 13 years old , and I really neeed help
1	When I was 7 I was diaognosed with ocd , depression , and anxiety
1	As of recently around thanksgiving of 2010 i had a very bad break down and have not been able to attend school and had to be homeschooled and barely can leave the house
1	I have been a cutter secretly since the age of 5
1	And my mood can go from happy to suicidal in the course of hours
1	My parents are not help because they believe i am just a very hormonial teenager , even though my dad should since he went through the same thing
1	I can not concentrate because of loud noises in my head i can not understand , the words
1	When i become very distraught i reside in my head trying to exscpe the world
1	I can hear a voice tell me to do things as counting my steps jumping up and down x amount of times which resulted in being labled having ocd
1	I can not even function regurally without a breakdown or going into a mode where i listen to my head
1	Because i worry when the voice says i will have a consequence if i do nt do what it says even though i do nt belive it i do
1	i have constant headaches and i can not go to sleep at night
1	Lately i have been contemplating suicide again , and have been very sure it would be best even though i do nt have a reason to die other than my constant pain which i can not take anymore , not for my sake but for those around me i effect
1	I have also been thinking about trying 2 check myself into a mental hospital to get my life back together , or maybe to be forgotten about those around me
1	I m cluless and i m scared cuz i have no idea what s wrong with me all i know is that i can not keep doing what i am doing and if something dosent change i am gon na be dead soon
1	Hi there , I hope that you can help
1	I posted this on BPD forum because it is the closest thing I have looked at
1	In some sense I have a fear of going to the doctor so I do look online to see if it 's anything to worry about in advance , so that I do n't need to go , hopefully
1	I 'd say deep down I know something was wrong too and this is an extreme case
1	I am almost 20 years of age , and i 'd say I have had a steady upbringing , only until being in a 3 year abusive , on and off relationship has it changed
1	At the time I did n't realise it was abuse or anything similar but now looking back on it and being more open to my close friends has my opinion changed
1	I only mention this because partially I think it has changed me , as a person
1	I have always had a steady education , not the brightest of the bunch but I coped and perserved and I am now studying in a good university
1	Throughout school I was different in that I liked playing football and I loved sport , a lot of people did n't understand that and made fun of that being from the UK and more specifically the area where I have been brought up , which is something I always hated and similar issues carried out throughout school
1	I have always had self image issues and since I was around 12 I have , and I have never admited this before , self abused my own body
1	I have 2 best friends who I have known and loved for years and then other close friends who I can not seem to keep in the same minds about , who I push away then attempt to pull back
1	I have a new boyfriend , who I was scared to get close to
1	He is such a lovely gentleman and knows how to treat me , he understands that something is wrong but would n't push me to do something about it
1	Our relationship however , from my point is bad
1	I love him dearly and want to stay with him , we have talked about being together forever and all that , which is something I would never do unless I truly meant it
1	However , I have turns which make me break it off , argue for no reason and act out irrationally
1	I took my worst turn the other day and punched a taxi driver
1	Something , I am completly ashamed of and I have gotton myself in to more and more fights these past 7 months
1	I know something is wrong with how I am dealing with my relationship and how I have pushed many friends away
1	I do not make the effort with my uni friends , I live at home , which has been hard , so I never bother
1	I never know how to act around people , which I have always found hard and this does cause me to act out in a way
1	Each have their own issues but I feel that my behaviour is causing myself to loose them and I really do n't want that to be the case as goes with my new boyfriend
1	I love these people and hate knowing that a small push could send them walking or disliking me for life
1	My parents and I have always had a good relationship , much better more recently with my mother
1	My father is a big drinker , but he is not the type to go out , he drinks everynight when he is n't working the following day and this is something that my parents have always argued about
1	I have never felt close with my father , and almost feel neglected because he makes a lot of effort with my brother and not me
1	My mother , I love dearly and is the reason i 'd rather seek advice online and not break down to her about my problems
1	I know my nan suffers a mental illness and for my mother to grow up around that must have been hard
1	I am not sure what is wrong but I do feel like I need help , I was wondering if anyone on here would like to comment about similar issues or if you think I am being stupid then by all means please let me know
1	I 'd like to sort out my relationships and aggressive tendencies because it is hurting my life in so many ways
1	I have a 20 year old son
1	when he turned 18 he thought he owned the world
1	He did eventually graduate , by the skin of his teeth
1	Since he has been 18 he has been couch surfing
1	he is not a defiantly angry type child and actually fun to talk to when he is not high
1	He had to enter a program because he stole with some friends
1	This program held him accountable to   clean for 6 months and do the homework of the program
1	He was one of six that graduated out of 18 went to court and has to do a 2 year probation and his record is expunged
1	Now that he is out of the program i feel he is sliding backward into the   he was in before , that is crapy friends , no job , laying around the house , no ambition , lots of bull talk
1	In the past My wife and I have kicked him out to try to get his   in gear
1	My wife allowed hime to come home to battle this court stuff but now that that is over we do n't know how to get him going or what we should do
1	He has said he wanted to end his life several times in the past
1	I have been with my soon to be exhusband for 7 years and we have two 7 year old girls
1	We have been on and off , living together and not for the entire 7 years but we were always still togehter He was physically and mentaly abusive and my daughters saw most of it
1	I did put up with it for 7 years and have recently desided to get a divorse
1	I met an awsome man that I believe truly cherishes my daughters and Ihere is where I am stuckMy husband claims to be miserable and said he understands what he did was wrong and he wants to prove that he can be a better husband and most of all a better dad
1	He has begged me for 10 mos now to come back
1	He said all that he needs is one chanceand that if I am not happy I can leave
1	I am very happy in my new relationship and it is a very healthy one
1	Do I need to give my husband a chance to be better for my daughters
1	They have never been attached to him nor do they ask to see him
1	I feel guilty that I wo nt
1	So I 'm 18 Years old I 'm a girl and I can say I 'm pretty as long as lots of people compliment me , so yeah I never really Felt pretty because of my bad breath
1	Whenever someone tells me you are pretty I 'm like nah you do n't know I 'm   even if I 'm I 'm just so useless because I literally ca n't talk seriously even I chew gum all the time it does n't help You do n't know the feeling until you are really In it I 'm so depressed my true personality is a kind funny joyful character but because of my all the time bad breath I 'm supposed to act different to get away people from me
1	Even I ca n't talk face to face to my mum and siblings I hate living life this way being away from friends family and cousins And knowin that people call you stinky
1	I tried probiotics and it caused me heart palpitations so I quitted taking it I do n't know what 's the problem I floss I gargle I do every thing but still it 's there ,
1	I do n't what 's my problem please help me my life is just feels like hell   Help me
1	I 'm 23 years old
1	My biological dad has bipolar and my mom worked a lot to raise my sister and me
1	My dad was abusive to my mom and to me , he was unreliable
1	After my parents separated , my mom and sister forged a new path but I claimed I loved my dad and could n't give up on him
1	I was 13 when my mom told me that he was n't a safe person
1	A couple of years later , I had a flashback
1	I do n't remember what it was all about except that my dad was hurting me somehow
1	Then , after my dad left , I masturbated a lot and resorted to fantasizing
1	It still continues to this day , where desiring sex has led me to really bad situations
1	I have had flings but not realizing what they were
1	I 'm concerned that all of this was because my dad molested me
1	But I do n't know how to express my concern to the people I love or trust
1	I tried to tell my mom once but she did n't believe me
1	I do n't know if I 'm pregnant or it just all in my head
1	I missed my period this month
1	My last period is on Oct 22 and as I thought it should come on 26 of November but it never came
1	Is it because of my new schedule because my new schedule is so stressful I almost forgot to eat and I do n't eat at the right time and I do n't get enough sleep because I have many things to accomplish at night
1	I heard that you can be pregnant through precum
1	Me and my bf had little naughty his thing touches mine but it never enters me
1	The day after that I 'm so very afraid because of what I 've read about being pregnant to precum
1	I think I feel the symptoms of pregnancy but its just 2 days after what happened but when I stop thinking and worrying I feel normal again
1	These past few days I feel normal but when I think about missing my period and the possibility that I can be pregnant I started to feel nervous , scared , and worried I also feel butterflies in my tummy same feeling when we get nervous I also have head ache and stiff neck
1	I 'm a very typical 16 year old girl in high school
1	However when I was 8 years old my mother passed away from a rare heart condition that no one knew she had
1	I had been the one to find her body and at the time thought she was merely in a deep sleepI have many awful memories from those few weeks but especially that day
1	As I 've been growing up , the hurt without her is still there but I 've accepted it
1	My father had put me into therapy immediately after so I could talk about it and those sessions helped
1	In my family , we 're really bad at keeping up with things like that so I 've been attending on and off sporadically throughout the years
1	The last time I attended , she brought up the touchy subject of my mother
1	There are times when thinking about it becomes too much and I cry , this particular session had me bawling my eyes out to the point where I could n't breathe
1	I have n't gone since and that was last year
1	Everything in my life has seemingly gotten better this year , but for some reason I 've become more paranoid
1	For example , one morning I had to wake my dad up for something and he did n't answer me right away
1	I began to cry very hard , it reminded me of being a child and screaming for my mom to wake up , and she never did
1	Today , he was supposed to pick me up from school early and never did
1	I called him 50 times and began to cry at school in fear that something had happened
1	I came home from school eventually to find out that he had fallen asleep
1	Once I knew he was okay , I fell to the floor sobbing
1	I do n't know why I 've become so scared recently , but every time something similar to this occurs I begin to see my father in the same condition as I found my mother
1	I hate this because it makes me feel like I 'm insane
1	I 'm sixteen in two weeks
1	I 've been hitoftenwhen I was younger
1	My family calls me names and thinks I 'm crazy and thinks that I 'm Devon 's daughter with a black heart
1	No friends but that one close friend whom I knew since I was in first grade
1	But as I grow older , I become more sentimental
1	I try to hide it from my family
1	I live with guilt that I once almost killed my brother
1	Alone in my house sometimes , I talk to myself
1	If I let my family know that I 'm weeping , they 'd look at me as if I 'm not part of them I know that
1	I tried telling my mother that I feel like I have emotional problems I was brought at once to the therapist
1	After one sedition , I pretended that I 'm all fixed up even though I 'm not , just so I do n't have to go through that again
1	I do n't see a point in my life
1	I 'm currently taking 150 mg of Lamictal , daily , as a mood stablizer
1	I was diagnosed Bipolar last year but my psychiatrist has always said she does n't think I really am Bipolar she 's just treating me for it
1	I guess the lable does nt really matter since there is no doubt that I am suffering from major depression
1	The medication has been helpful but I am noticing that it is not as effective as it was when I first started taking it
1	I 'm sure I need an increase but I lost my private insurance a few months ago and ca n't get in to see a medicaid doctor for 3 more months
1	My PCP has been writing my prescription for me but will not increase my dose since she is not the original prescriber
1	I 've been thinking about taking St John 's Wort , to help boost my mood , but have read that it may not react well with Lamictal
1	Thank you , BTW , I also take 1 mg of Klonopin on occasion for night time anxiety
1	I had sex on December 6th and again the 28th with my boyfriend
1	I wanted to be sure I did n't get a UTI , so I went home not long afterward both times and it took about an hour to get home
1	They were his first two times , but my 3rd and 4th
1	When I got home on the 28th I immediately went to the bathroom
1	It looked like sperm , they moved or appeared to at least , but I only saw them on the bottom of the water due to the light making a shadow appear
1	My boobs are kinda sore , I 've had cloudy urine
1	I started crying tonight when I was talking to one of my friends and he had some pretty bad news , but I normally would n't have cried over it
1	I cried in a couple movies I would n't have normally cried in a few days ago
1	I 've taken 3 pregnancy tests and they were all negativeI know it 's too early to test if anything happened on the 28thso , is it too early to have these symptoms due to pregnancy or are my tests wrong
1	I do n't want my parents knowing until I know for sure , so I have a friend that can get them for me and I just pay her back for it
1	I also had a period on Dec 19th , but it only lasted like 34 days when they usually last 67 days at least
1	I have n't had one for January yet , but it 's not time yetbut I have had some brown blood or discharge one and it had a very little bit of blood in itany ideas on what this could be
1	I 've also experienced some crampingI have one test left from the last time she got me some tests , so I 'm going to wait and see if I do n't have my period for Januarywhat are your opinions , comments , or adviceinput
1	She got me four tests and 3 turned out negative
1	When I was 16 I started taking the BC depo provera and was on it for about 10 years then decided to stop
1	I did n't have periods while on depo but they eventually returned to normal and ran like clock work
1	Last year I started having problems with pelvic pain , painful intercourse , bad menstrual cramps , low back pain , and flu like feelings at certain points during my cycle
1	I saw the gyno in April this year and had a pap and pelvic exam and even a pelvic and abdominal ultra sound
1	Everything came back normal and the Dr suggested I try birth control to relieve the bothersome symptoms associated with my period
1	So that is when I went back on Deop and things seemed to get better
1	However I had my last shot on Oct 31 and have been noticing that my pelvic pain , cramps , painful intercourse , and low back aches are returning
1	Now on top of that I 've recently experience night sweats every night , and bouts of hot flashes and cold chills
1	The night sweats could be due to having the furnace on but my husband does n't wake all sweaty so I 'm not sure about that theory
1	I wake up and my clothes are soaked and I 'm freezing from the sweat evaporating off my body
1	I have been diagnosed with UCTD , and my doctor is leaning towards SLE
1	My beautiful , talented granddaughter was in her first parade Saturday night and I missed it because the temp outside was in the 30s and I was already spasming so badly I could barely move
1	I knew if I tried to sit outside in nearly freezing temps for 2 hours that I would lock up to the point I would be in agony , possibly for days
1	My daughter is 31 years old , with 3 children of her own
1	She acts as though she thinks I am a hypochondriac that just makes excuses so I do n't have to do things I do n't want to do
1	Her comment to me when she stopped by after the parade was Since you CHOSE not to go I felt that her comment was unfair and meanspirited , even borderline hateful
1	I suppose that , technically , I did choose not to go , but I did not choose to have UCTDLupus and I did not choose to be in pain 247
1	I love my grandchildren with all my heart and it kills me to have to disappoint any of them , but I just could n't go
1	I would love to have seen my granddaughter perform in her first parade
1	I have thought about telling her I do n't want to talk to her until she can accept the fact that I have an illness and that I have limitations , but I ca n't bear the thought of not seeing her and my grandchildren
1	I am devastated by her attitude , but I 'd be even more devastated without her and the children in my life
1	It tells me I 'm worthless Dead to the world Nothing Nobody A failure Selfish Bad A burden Ugly Guilty A poor excuse for a gfdaughtersister etc Everything is my fault I should kill myself I do n't deserve happiness , or I 'll get it if I doso and so I should hurt myself I should punish myself Nobody likes me Everyone thinks bad of me Everyone is judging me If I do n't do things it says then the big black cloud will get me , kill me , swallow me up and take over my body and ruin my life I should do bad things I should hide myself in case I am recognised as then noone will find me I should n't go outside People are following me I should n't talk , people will take me away or think bad of me or conspire against me Nobody loves me , people pretend to get things from me or they 're under cover trying to get me ' keep your friends close and your enemies closer ' Everyone will leave me I ca n't trust people , everyone is out to get me There is always someone trying to get into the house and attack me Someone I love is possessed by the black cloud and so I ca n't trust themit 's not really them they are possessed Threatens me with bees which it will release into my head if I do n't do a certain thing and they will sting my brain and kill me slowly Tells me that if I do n't do what it wants bad things will happen to my friends and family It 's always watching me and checking on me It leads a team of evil things that could come and get me as they are all possessed ie
1	I 'm always jumpy or think anyone behind me is following me and so walk really fast
1	The voice in my head shows me flashes of what it wantstries to manipulate and control me 247 eg
1	shows me a lot of blood , if I look anywhere it changes the image to something horrible , eg
1	a tree   being raped on it or someone watching me behind it about to jump out and get me , a lake   a dead bodyand example of what I could be if I do n't do what it asks or An image of me dead in the lake and flashes of me walking into it and letting myself die as I 'll look beautiful and that 's what I should do
1	This is controlling my life and I keep seeing things everywhere noone else sees and then they disappear and I am SO paranoid someone is trying to get meI am always running and being distracted in public talks or just even when I am with my friends and I go against people I love thinking they are possessed a lotARRGH what is this

1	I want to quit therapy , but my case manager said if I quit and stop taking my medswhich I did 2 weeks ago , then I loose my gym membership
1	It may not seem like a big deal , but the gym releases my weight pressures and help me not eat so much
1	But I ca n't take my meds bs I want the people inside me back
1	So I have n't taken them in 15 days
1	I want the gym , but is n't them more
1	And I m jut getting really upset bc my case manager said its the Dr That said I needed my meds , and he knows what he is doing
1	I mean , I already wanted to do things , but now I REALLY want to do things
1	I just wanted to do it since I left the hospital last month
1	But the cuts I want to do will lead me back to the hospital
1	So I was going to quit therapy so I wo n't be obliged to tell them
1	I justI know it 'll bleed a lot , and I want to be able to live , despite my feelings towards life right now , I want to live
1	I was thinking about sewing my cut up after I get done
1	Just that I have no one really to talk to that wo n't send me back to the hospital
1	What s going to happen if I tell them my plans for cutting
1	I want to go to the wedding I 'm in
1	And I leave for it next week
1	My care team wo n't really listen unless I take my meds , and I 'm of going to take them

1	Now I 'm always alonewithout them , I 'm nothing
1	I want them back , please help me outI dunno how , but please try
1	Yesterday I noticed that my submental lymph node midline under the chin at the anterior portion of the neck about 1 cm in from the mandible is somewhat enlarged
1	I do have a sore like a big pimple or boil on my upper left lip that has slowly been healing over the past 5 days or so
1	My throat has also been slightly scratchy for a few days but no pain , coughing , or other symptoms
1	For the past 4 nights or so I woke in the morning with a very dry mouth , but this has abated
1	I have not had other symptoms such as weight loss , night sweats , or itching
1	Could the probably infected sore on my UPPER lip cause this node to swell
1	I have tried a warm compress to reduce the size of this node , however it seems to be the same size as it was last night
1	I have a vacation coming up in 3 weeks and I do not want to have to worry about this while I 'm trying to enjoy myself
1	i have been with the same woman for 18 months
1	she confided in me that she was molested as a young child by a family member , age 10 her family told her it never happened and to never bring it up again
1	at 13 she was raped by a friend who she thought she could trust , again , her family said she should not have put herself in this position
1	she turned to drugs and alcohol at 16 and ran with whoever would give her attention , in and out of mostly abusive relationships
1	thankfully she has been clean and sober for 4 years now , and is trying to do the next right thing
1	she tells me i am the best relationship she has ever been in , but , the problem we are having is there is absolutely no sexual contact between us
1	at the beginning of the relationship we did have intercourse maybe 3 or 4 times , mostly rushed to the point of her saying , lets get this over with
1	the last time we were intimate was 9 months ago
1	we have talked about her fear of intimacy and not wanting to do so unless i backed her into a corner , which i have told her i will not do
1	i love and respect her too much to hurt her for my own selfish needs
1	she started counseling 2 months ago , but she has canceled more appointments than she has attended
1	she cried the other night and told me she did nt want to go through this , but knew she needed to , and did nt want to loose me
1	lately all she is doing is working 7 days a week , and some nights also
1	when we see each other it may be for maybe 2 or 3 hours
1	we will cook dinner together at her apartment and she will usually go to bed after that
1	i love this woman very much and i am committed to her well being , but i do nt know if i can continue to ignore my own needs if she continues to fill her time with work and not truly deal with this problem
1	do i just need to let her continue what she is doing in the hopes that she will go to therapy and put a true effort into her recovery , and this relationship
1	Ever feel like you are losing control of your future
1	I am surprised I have not seen a related post to job   career based anxiety
1	I feel like I am in a losing battle with constant anxiety over my economic future
1	I have a job again , but its the most stressful job I ever had with the worst , most stressful jerk of a boss possible
1	My thoughts are consumed with the stress and anxiety this man causes me
1	I ca nt seem find anything better as my field of work has shrunk
1	People say I am lucky to be employed , since I seem to be a victim of company downsizing every three years
1	But I feel like I 'm on the edge of going crazy
1	Changing field of work is economically not possible at this time for me , I have a mortgage to pay
1	So I have to learn to deal with this evil work environment for I do nt know how long
1	Any good books or web sites that will help me deal with an a   hole boss
1	I try to exercise , but stress itself makes exercise painful some times   I get sore from stress
1	I take st johns wart   seems to do nothing for me
1	Five years ago I took Zoloft for this same thing I did n't like it , it turned me into an emotionless droid   My sense of humor went totally away and that is the only thing that keeps me sane
1	I am 32 years old , diagnosed with BPD 6 years ago
1	I fit all the traits of BPD
1	But everything I read says that BPD stems from sexualmentalphysical abuse as a child
1	My dad worked full time , my mom was a SAHM
1	Not a day went by that I did n't hear I love you from my parents
1	My BPD came to light right after my kids father left me
1	I 'm a great mom , very attentive to my kids , love doing fun activities with them , and give them the world
1	My kids are my everything
1	I can manage my finances , pay all bills on time
1	I just had my 5 year redetermination and SS determined me still disabled
1	I have a functional support worker I see once a week every other week and a psychiatrist I see once every two months
1	My meds are Zoloft 50 mg once a day and Trazodone 100 mg once a day
1	I come from a large family , to cut a long story short , we are all adults now , but for 13 years now one of my siblings are estranged as they sexually molested a few of my younger siblings , wish not to go into details
1	I only recently found out my parents had very limited contact with the person in question , and only this year my estranged sibling actually got in touch with me , told me they wanted to reach out as they have tried to commit suicide four times in the last year and wanted to tell me how much they love me
1	I have kept contact via email only as I do not want my husband and own children or my immediate family as in my other sibblings finding out
1	I feel totally guilty and trapped about this and it is making me ill
1	This evening was the final straw for me , when I received a message from the person in question and was told that they have been severely beaten up , left for dead basically and were lucky to be alive , and that they could not stop crying and wanted to just talk to someone from their family
1	I was horrified and got an awful shock , phoned my Father and he told me to leave it well alone and to just get on with my life , I am so upset , I had to respond to see if they were all right , even though I feel so bad for my other sibblings
1	I am in a right pickle now and do not know what to do , I could not eat my dinner and have heartburn all day long because of it
1	We have a 10 month old daughter
1	We live in Korea , have no family on either side around us and I speak no Korean
1	The following is a description of my wifes behaviour since i met her 3 years ago
1	She can not control her temper and if i react to the bait she will immediately say ' let 's divorce ' , in fact almost every single minor disagreement ends up with her saying ' i want to divorce '
1	Recently she has started to have violent tendencies , throws and smashes things and has hit me on a few ocassions
1	Within a day or two of each serious argument she will behave as though nothing happened , but will refuse to talk about any past incident or violent behaviour
1	At the moment these arguments are happening twice a week   in the fairly recent past we could two or three weeks without one
1	This I guess is the crux of our relationship problem other traits or characteristics of my wife that I think are not particular normal are as follows    Suffers a lot from stress , which she feels very easily
1	  can be very rude   especially to me when asking for mundane things pass the tissues , close the door etc   almost never apologises for anything serious , if i challenge her she will sometimes make a ridiculous excuse to explain her behaviour but often simply refuses to answer or gets extremely angry at any question that exposes her behaviour
1	  when angry blames me for almost every single aspect of her life
1	  has a difficult relationship with some family members    During her pregnancy was an absolute nightmare in trimester 1 , but absolutely lovely for the duration of trimester 2
1	I have spoken to her about her behaviour , i have suggested she needs some kind of mental help   although often at the tail end of a horendous row rather than in calmer moments she rejects any suggestion out of hand , saying I am the cause of any problem and that she was absolutely fine before she met me
1	It is a very difficult situation , considering how isolated we are and how difficult it is for me to be aware of and to contact any appropriate advice or services
1	Mental health issues tend to still be ignored and are percieved very negatively in Korea   I love my wife but it is extremely hard to like her 20 of the time and now my main priority is our daughter who at the moment is the sole reason for us still to be living together
1	About a month ago I found a small lump on the left side of my neck , right in front of the muscle
1	Then , about a week ago , I found another , a little larger , but about the same size as a pea , on the same side , behind the muscle
1	I went into full on panic mode , googled Lymphoma symptoms , and made an appointment
1	My doctor said they are lymph nodes I had hoped for cysts , but that though they are slightly enlarged , they are within normal range
1	However , she then started asking me about other symptoms all of which were for Lymphoma , but I do n't have any other symptoms
1	She did n't seem very concerned , but did n't definitively say there 's nothing to worry about , either , which made it 100xs worse
1	She ordered regular blood work and said anything abnormal would show up there , but I 've read Lymphoma can not be diagnosed through blood work alone
1	So now I 'm terrified for the results of the blood tests , but also anxious because I know even if they are normal I wo n't relax
1	She said to come back in a few weeks if they are still there and when I told her they had already been there a few weeks and I have n't been sick , she said to come back if they harden , get bigger , or if I get more
1	Should I follow up and demand a CT scan
1	Why would I have enlarged lymph nodes when I have n't been sick
1	I 'm not sure if I should be worried or not but I have a son who is 15 almost 16 years old
1	He has had some strange things going on with him and I 'm kind of nervous
1	Let me give you the history first
1	Last November we took him into the doctor because he has 3 swollen lymph nodes we could feel
1	One was by his jaw another in front of his ear and the last down by his collar bone
1	He was not sick nor had he been sick for a long time
1	They did eventually go away but they never did any biopsy or anything
1	Around March he said he had a bump on his right leg about a 14 of the way down from his knew
1	I showed the doctor the bump and she felt it was most likely a injury from sports or something
1	My son has aspergers and sports is n't his thing
1	Since then my doctor has moved out of state and we have moved as well
1	My son has started complaining that he has been waking up completely soaked in his bed
1	He says when he is in PE he has noticed his right leg starts tiring much faster than his left leg
1	The tech even said she could see exactly where we were talking about
1	My son was at his friends house the other day and they were watching tv and he moved to a different seat and my son 's friends mom came and sat in the chair and she told me it was soaked
1	She said my son said he just does that sometime
1	I noticed he is changing his underwear all the time because he is soaking through them
1	She said they had not been doing anything to cause them to be sweating
1	I 'm currently unable to be diagnosed as BPD since I do n't meet the age requirement for personality disorders
1	Although , my psychiatrist and my different therapists agree I 'm a severe case of it according to my history and current diagnosis
1	What I worry about is that I have a very passionate interest in serial killers , and this past year I 've recognized several symptoms I share with the average killer
1	My therapists say that my fascination with them and all the gruesome things they do is from my personal interest in pain , emotions , and being in control
1	I know this wo n't guarentee me becoming a serial killer , I just notice that I have many common interests , symptoms , and urges that match the earlier stages of killers like Jeffrey Dahmer , Ted Bundy , Richard Rivera , etc
1	I just wonder if my concern should be made more real
1	I was with my ex boyfriend for about 2 yearswe broke up in march of 09 ' so almost a year ago
1	i was pregnant and he slashed me with a 12 inch machete and then almost choked me to death
1	I never talked to him after that night and only saw him in court and here and there around the county i live in i hide when i see him i am petrified of him
1	He also broke my nose in three places and shattered my cheek bone amongst tons of other incidences i do n't feel like rehashing
1	i also became heavily addicted to pain pills during our relationship because i had to have many surgeries to fix all the damage he was doing to my body
1	Anyway i am 46 day clean of pills
1	after we broke up i was a mess for a while and in counseling a program called advocates against victims of assault
1	i went to group sessions and a couple of individual ones for 3 or 4 months
1	and i felt better and moved on or thought i did
1	the thing is i ca n't stop thinking about him and i wake up in the middle of the night remembering him hitting me
1	and sometimes i lay in bed at night and feel my face and my nose and remember the night he closed fist punched me in the face and how scary it was and i ca n't sleep
1	i also have not been able to get close to any man since my ex
1	i have dated guys or i should say guys have tried to date me unsuccessfully
1	i just end up pushing them away
1	and it 's not because i am scared they will hurt methis is the totally screwed up partit 's because i can not love them like i loved him
1	it 's not that we will ever get back together or that i want to or anything like thatlike i said we do n't even talk anymore , it 's just because of the way that i loved him
1	Thanks everyone for telling ur stories , it really makes me feel better that i m not the only one dealing w these same issues
1	I m 38 weeks pregnant right now
1	Oct 2012 was quite crazy for me , i got laid off from my job of 10 years , the followimg week my bf broke up w me and the following week i found out i was pregnant
1	When i told him i was pregnant he really tried to pressure me into an abortion , like almost went too far w it
1	Then he did nt speak to me until january and acted like he want to be a father
1	He only came to the second ultrasound and i text him after every dr appt but he puts no effort forth at all
1	I do nt even know if he has any baby stuff at all
1	Also i moved out of state in may to live w my parents unemployed single n prego , prob my best choice to move home so i ca nt blame him for not coming to my new dr appts but i m getting real close to havin my baby and its just been getting so hard to not worry about what he s gon na do i mean i want my boy to know his father but if he s gon na b like this maybe i do nt
1	But who knows , i did nt text him after last weeks appt to see if he d text me and nothing he seems to be too busy drinking w his new gf
1	Oh and his mother is driving me crazy
1	I only met her a few months ago and she is all into the baby , emails and fb msgs all the time
1	Its nice that she cares being her son does nt seem to , but she has this i m better than everyone attitude so all her msgs to me just seem snotty and condesending
1	I m really just trying to stay calm , not worry and relax , especially for the baby being i am so close to my due date , so thank you for listening , and if u got any advise , ill gladly take it
1	I am NOT YET 52 and freaking out
1	Literally a year ago , my arms were great
1	I was on vacation just last June and wore a bathing suit as normal
1	About a year and a half ago , I had noticed my hair seemed to be thinning rather quickly
1	At 5'4 , I 'd lost about 20 pounds by my vacation last year and was down to 125 I 'd only had the extra weight on my body for about a year and a half having gained it also due to stress so figured when I lost it I 'd look like I 'd looked before
1	I also stopped taking birth control pills about a year and a half ago thinking it was keeping weight on me
1	It never occurred to stupid me that it was keeping my hormones up and my skin on
1	It seemed like LITERALLY OVERNIGHT , my skin fell off
1	I was doing push ups and looked down at my legs
1	My thigh skin looked like an OLD LADY 'S
1	I then noticed my neck had that horrible crepey look which I never had
1	The skin just under my armpit and going down my inner arm got horribly crepey and every time I look down heaven forbid my arms are at my sides I could just cry
1	I feel like I 've aged 20 years in 6 months
1	I have literally looked at EVERY ONE I know that 's LATE 50 's and 60 's and NOT ONE OF THEM has this
1	I also noticed that suddenly my face got hairy
1	I 'm blondish thank goodness but it 's not a good look to have fuzz all over your face
1	I also NEVER had a grey hair and overnight the grey started
1	I 've worked out my whole adult life
1	I went from being able to lift pretty heavy weights to now being on the LIGHTEST weight possible
1	My arms LOOK toned other than the new giant waddle and hanging wrinkled skin but I can barely lift anything
1	I always looked younger than my age
1	This skin is literally making me look like an old lady in a retirement home in Florida no offense Florida seniors
1	My mother did n't have hanging arms until she was in her 70 's
1	I can not imagine how I will live my life now as it 's summer and I 'm either wearing exercise tanks for working out or sleeveless t 's
1	I have been pinching the skin did n't imagine anyone else would do that but it seems you all have
1	I see that Thermage is SUPPOSEDLY done on arms , but I 've literally called every doctor around me and no one has done it for the arms
1	I 'm so glad to read that there are a few early 50 year olds freaking out about this like I am
1	Anyone with info or a referral to doctor in NY area who does Thermage on ARMS , please let me know
1	my older sister and her husband lost custody of their kids up in jersey around sometime in 2004 so my mom went to court to get temp
1	after she got that , my sister and him moved down here and lived with us in our house
1	me and my brotherinlaw became close friends and i loved him like an older brother
1	then on dec 13 2005 two days before my 16th birthday we went on a walk up to the store and he offered to get chinese for dinner as my birthday present from him
1	on the walk home he said we probably should nt take it home cause everyone else would want some , so he said we could go to this house right around the block from our house and he had a key cause the guy worked for owns that house and only used it during the day as his workshop
1	which i did nt see a problem until he locked the door behind us and took the inside key and put it in his pocket
1	then when we sat down at the table he said the electricity did nt work so we 'd have to light a candle
1	after we finished eating we got up to throw everything in the trash and after i threw my stuff away he walked up close to me head on , and started to kiss me
1	i eventually got him off me and said that we should go home
1	from feb to april he made more attempts than i can count
1	he would ask if i wanted to go up to the gas station and get a couple sixpacks
1	then on the way home he 'd find a spot that we could drink at with out getting caught
1	sometimes he would pull out a joint or some minishot bottles of liquor and tell me it was all mine
1	after i finished smoking or drinking he would slide his hand under my shirt and start touching me then he would lay me down and try to get on top of me
1	the first time he tried this i pushed him off and said what the hell are you doing
1	and everytime he tried after that he would get further and further
1	then on april 20th 06 me and him were the only ones home and he bought about 20 sparks alcohol and a   load of pot
1	we split the drinks , but i think he tricked me into drinking more than him , and he told me the pot was all for me and he told me to light up and i think he packed me atleast 4 or 5 bowls from a pipe
1	he was in the house while i was smoking a cig in the backyard and once i finished i went in the house looking for him and then i saw him sitting there on my bed looking at my cds
1	he told me to come here and put some cd he picked out in the stereo
1	so while i was doing that i saw him get up and go lock the front door and look out the window , then he came back in my room and came up behind me and pushed himself up against me and start kissing the back of my neck
1	he turned me around and layed me down on the bed and he took his clothes off and climbed on me and started to take mine off
1	i wanted to move or yell for help or something , but i was so messed up that i could nt even lift my arms up off the bed and sit up
1	and the whole time he was on me i tried so hard to get him off me but it was no use and i just layed there crying till he finished and got dressed and left to go to work
1	to make a long story short , i eventually gave up on fighting him and he raped me repeatedly everyday thru the end of september 06 i finally told someone what he did to me and went to the police
1	they arrested him and held him for a month
1	my sister took his side over mine saying that i suduced him and   like that
1	and i thought i was going to lose my sister and then she told me that she was pregnant this one being her 7th with his baby , and how was she supposed to get out of our house with all 6 , soon to be 7 , kids
1	she also told me what terry was telling her about how prision was and that he was being abused because people found out what he was doing to a minor and were threatening to do it to him
1	i just became so overwhelmed with guilt and i started to think that maybe i did lead him on and that i deserved what he did to me and that it was nt really rape so i dropped the charges and he was released at the beginning of jan 07 since may of this year he s been up in northern florida , and i just found out that he is going to be moving back here to orlando
1	i did see him once since he was released and he was talking about how he did nt regret anything he did , and that he was about to disown his wife again
1	i m terrified of him if he s in town
1	i do nt know , i might just be paranoid , but i feel like he s going to try stuff again , and this time , i m going to be of age18 in dec , so unless i have bruises and marks , i have no case against him
1	i do nt know what i should do
1	i did get counciling from this amazing therapist who has helped me through alot of the past , but i could nt continue going cuz it was 90 per visit
1	and now that he s coming back to town i ve been feeling anxious , depressed and scared
1	that s the only thought going thru my head repeatedly all day and especially at night while i m trying to fall asleep
1	My mom died suddenly in June 2006
1	My 20 yo son had a breakdown that same summer and in January of 2007 attempted suicide
1	He was hospitalized 4 times over 5 months and diagnosed with bipolar
1	He is now stable on Lithium , living at home with me and able to keep a job now
1	My 15 yo daughter had 3 surgeries between Oct 06 and June 07 and they all failed
1	We were sent to Childrens Hospital Boston where a Geneticist diagnosed her with EhlersDanlos , a rare connective tissue disorder
1	She suffers from constant pain , has lost the use of her hands and is in and out of a wheel chair now
1	My oldest son 23yrs graduated from college , has a gf and they both live with me
1	In June I learned that my husband had been having an affair with the mother of my son 's gf the kids did not know and he left me and now lives with her
1	I can not work do to the full time care of my daughter
1	Last , but not least , my dearest sisterinlaw is losing her battle with cancer and is growing weaker every day
1	She and my brother are the only family I have
1	I am trying very hard to get control over my stress I take antidepressants , antianxiety meds , I walk my dogs regularly , I do guided imagery , I listen to tranquil music daily while resting to help me escape for about 30 , and I have reached out to the few friends that I have for support
1	I guess I just have to live through all this   but the grief is overwhelming
1	I thought I would be married for life
1	I nearly lost my son and now my daughter has an incurable disease that will progress , and I feel alone alone alone and scared all the time
1	When I do the guided imagery   I mostly end up angry and turning it off
1	I have thoughts of suicide , but know that my kids really need me here , so I distract myself in any way I can when I feel those thoughts coming on
1	I feel guilty even writing all of this   I know my life is good compared to so many others who are losing their life , etc
1	I am trying to keep a list of the good things in my life   but its so hard to bring my head to those things when I feel such grief and loss
1	Thank you for your time
1	My husband has serious anger control issues that I 'm sure he learned from his parents
1	His father was in and out of anger managment counselling throughout my husbands childhood and his mother is a perpetually dissatisfied person
1	We have been together for 5 years and in the last few years I have felt like I am tied to a lead block that has been dropped in the ocean
1	He is dragging me down and I am watching myself drown
1	Our relationship works on a cycle He is moody and combative for weeks and weeks while I walk on eggshells in hopes of not setting him off , then he blows up at me no physical violence though and then I crack and blow up at him and then he realizes how far he 's pushed me , he feels guilty and worships me just long enough usually 3ish days for me to think he 's really changed and then he slowly goes back to square one
1	I have literally lost count of all the times he 's promised me he 's going to go to anger counselling and he never does
1	He has also admitted to me that he sometimes pushes me to a breaking point to get a reaction
1	For that reason , I feel like an   if I leave him what kind of partner abandons their spouse when their spouse needs support
1	I do n't know the stats on this and I 'd appreciate some feedback
1	Am I fighting or , rather , supporting a lost cause or is there potential for him to come around
1	Okay , I'm using my sister 's account right now with her permission
1	I 'm her 16 year old sister , by the way
1	Alright , my sister was diagnosed with schizophrenia a couple months ago , but I was never told what kind it was
1	I 've been asking and asking and got the same answer each time She has schizophreniashe'll be fine
1	Well I 'm not going to ask my little sister what kind she has , since she hates herself enough for having it
1	Like , a train conductor under her bed who watches her sleep every night and wants her to die the same way he did
1	She has this little silver pocket watch that she carries around all the time
1	If someone calls her a freak , she'll go in the bathroom and stare at herself and scream ' FREAK ' at the relection for hours
1	Sometimes I ca n't understand what the hell she 's saying
1	Yes , we are from Japan but her English is improving by the day if you pay close attention
1	2 Delusions , Hallucinations When I 'm around Scream she starts talking to someone who is supposedly sitting right beside of her
1	She tells me that she has made friends with ' the little girl who was gased at the Holocaust ' and they ' play hide and seek and other fun games ' all the time
1	When a plane goes by she runs and dives under the closest car , bush or other ' safe place ' and puts her hands over her ears
1	When the plane has passed , she starts screaming THE NAZIS
1	THEY WANT ME AND KIRSTEN DEAD
1	Scream has also told me the adventures she has had with a girl ' who had killed herself by jumping on a bed of knives ' , and that girl 's name is Winter
1	Scream also tells me of the ghosts , demons , spirits and even ' real life ' people running around her room at night , wanting Scream to get up and play or steal from the neighbors
1	She rocks Doom and sings weird lullabys to her
1	She smashes her hands in heavy doors , she cuts her arms , wrists , ankles and stomach open with razors , she scratches herself as hard she can with a screwdriver , etc
1	I want her to give the baby doll uphow can I get her to
1	I hate it when she hurts herself

1	I am terrified that I may have uterine cancer
1	Here is my story Back in December 2007 I had some pelvic pain and my dr send me for an US
1	When the results came in he told me that everything was fine
1	Then in March 2008 I had some abnormal bleeding between my periods
1	I went back to my doctor and he did some testing which came back as a east infection the first one in my life
1	I was prescribed meds and I seemed to be fine after that
1	In May I had another abnormal bleeding with bad cramping in my left lower abdomen
1	I went back to my doctor and he sent me once again for an US
1	This time when the results came in he called me and told me that he wanted to speak to me
1	So it was taking forever to schedule an appointment with a gyne and I had to take it into my own hands
1	I went to my doctors office got a refferral for a gyne and along with it they gave me reports from the previous ultrasound , done in December
1	It got me really scared , I do n't have it in front of me right now , but I will write what I remember , things that got me scared Very thick endometrium 22 cm
1	Please help , I ca n't sleep , I ca n't eat all I do is think that I have cancer and that I am not going to be around much longer
1	I have an appointment with gyne on Monday June 23 , but it is still 3 days away
1	I was wondering if anyone could give me ideas on what my rash is coming from
1	I got 4 trigger point injections with Marcaine done 3 weeks ago for the first time ever for Fibromyalgia
1	The next daySaturday about 27hrs later , I discovered that I had several red blotchy rashes all over most of my upper bodychest , breasts , stomach , whole back , shoulders and upper arms , and face
1	It has continued to come back like that everyday and again leave in a few minutessometimes up to an hr or so but then keeps coming back more than once a day everyday for the past 3 weeksThe only other thing that I have done differently besides getting those trigger point injections , is that I did increase my Vicoden pills from 1 a day up to 3 a day that Saturday that I got the rash later that eveningThat is also the day after the day I got the trigger point injections
1	It has now been 3 weeks with this red blotchy rash that comes and goes sporadically throughout the day everyday and I do n't know what it 's from
1	I tried decreasing the Vicoden back down to 1 pill a day and taking Claritin in day and Benadryl at night and its still not going away and keeps coming back everyday
1	So my question is what do you think this rash is and what is it being caused from
1	Do you think it 's an allergic reaction from the trigger point injections or from the Vicoden or neither
1	My doctor does n't know what the rash could be from and said he did n't think it was from the Vicoden because I had already been taking 1Vicoden pill a day for 2 months with no rashes up until the day I increased it to 3 pills a day which he says should n't make a difference bc if I was allergic , that should 've happened even when I was just on 1Vicoden a day
1	I have several chronic pain conditions that cause me anxiety and stress and worry
1	He said you are very anxious and stressed and maybe the rashes are from that
1	The thing is though , I 've been anxious and stressed my whole life and especially so these last three years when I got all these pain conditions
1	So what bothers me about that answer is why would I all of a sudden get these rashes from stress if I never got them before when I was anxious and stressed
1	Something very tragic and unexpected happened recentlyMy father passed away in a car accident and i ca nt make peace with the fact that i m never see him againi keep thinking about the day his colleagues came to tell me that he was no longer with us , for a moment there it felt unreal , but when i got home from potch , it then hit me that he 's really gonei've always been daddy 's girl and its upheaval for me to let go of him and make peace with his deathhe passed away on july 28th at about 12 noonhe was driving from bloemfontein to home along with two other colleaguesthey all died due to a headon collision with a truck and they were all injured very badlyim really trying to be strong but the truth is , im not succeedingim even failing at varsity and i do nt understand why because i do studyi really miss papa , sometimes i d dial his number hoping to hear his voice , but then it hits me that his gonei spend most of my time thinking about papaI am sad , hurt and angry right nowangry at the world , angry at those who still have their fathers and angry at life
1	i ve gone to doctors and they 've prescribed all kinds of antidepression pills and they 're not helping muchmy school work is suffering and i feel helpless because i do study but nothing productive comes out of iti do nt want to give up on life and i certainly know that papa would want me to be successful and happy in life , but right now life   like hell
1	how do i deal with my pain
1	My baby girl was born Jan 14 , so she 's almost 1 month old
1	I feel really down most of the time , and I get very agitated easily , like even the smallest things will set me off
1	I 'm 21 , and live at home with my parents
1	They 've been so helpful with everything , but its still hard , and I do n't feel like I have a right to say that because I do have alot of help
1	When I know I 'm going to be home alone with the baby I get so anxious about it
1	I feel like I 'm not doing anything right , and that I 'm letting everyone down
1	Then I have moments where I know I 'm doing everything I can I 'm still in school , and worked up until the day before I delivered
1	I had to have emergency surgery to remove my gallbladder when baby girl was just about 3 weeks old , and since then I 've been out of it
1	I ca n't do anything , and I feel like I should be doing so much more
1	I 'm really down about that , because I really wanted to continue doing it , even if it kind of was a pain in my butt
1	There 's so much I really wo n't get into it , but its a huge stress for me
1	So the bills all go to me , and he gripes about how much time I let him see her
1	I have a lawyer ready to go , but I do n't know if I 'm ready to go down that road yet
1	Also I 've lost so much weight since giving birth that even my pre pregnancy clothes fall off of me
1	I hate the way I look now , and everything that s going on is starting to make me hate myself
1	I feel like I should do more , but I just ca n't
1	I love my daughter so much , but when she 's crying in the middle of the night I sometimes wish I would've been more careful
1	I wo nt tell u my life story bc i feel like its an excuse
1	I caught myself crying and calling out for home one day
1	After , I thought home , does that mean my hometown
1	I used to call for my dad and now I was calling for home
1	I have always felt out of place , like i do nt belong here or was nt the right person
1	How do you deal when you feel like you are miles away from yourself
1	your soul is drifting away but your body remains
1	I deal with it by doing the things most hate and I wait for the end , long for itCan I reassociate with my body , decend back to it and be a normal happy person
1	I only wish , but would rather let myself go to the perfect placeWith my light , Father , LoveGOD
1	Basically I am getting married in 6 months
1	we have been together 6 years and are very happy
1	I am 27 male and have only ever had sex with my girlfriend , until i had sex with maybe up to 10 females escorts over the last 18 months
1	At first it started because i needed to know what sex was like with another woman but this then led to various encounters which i am now terribly ashamed of
1	I 've had STD and HIV tests that confirm I am all clear
1	With my marriage getting closer and closer I am becoming very worried I 'm not going to be able to stand in church infront off all my family and say our vows
1	I made a decision a number of months ago to try to move on as I do n't believe I 'm a bad person overall
1	I really love my fiancee and definately want to get married
1	so february 26 , was the last time i had unprotected sex
1	it was for about 30 seconds and he did n't ejaculate
1	it was the day before my period was expected to arrive
1	my period arrived normally and since then i had one food adversion
1	i made a food that had an extreme amount of butter and the whole day , the thought of butter made me nauseated
1	since , i have n't really had morning sickness or any food adversion , and i never really crave anything specific
1	i had my period the month of march starting march 27 , and it was about as long as normal , as well as the one for april 27 i have not noticed weight gain and it 's getting around 12 weeks
1	my period is due this upcoming saturday
1	i noticed my breasts were a little sore for a few days only about a week and a half ago , and my areolas have not been darker or larger than normal
1	my urge to urinate is not constant like i have heard people say pregnant women have , about every few hours but i do drink around 2 12 cups of coffee every morning which i 've read can cause it as well
1	i just got off work , ate a huge meal and i look like i have a food baby that 's how i describe it because i 've never been bloated
1	i am too afraid to take a pregnancy test and my boyfriend is trying to convince me that i am most likely not pregnant because it was for maybe 30 seconds , if that
1	if anyone can help me and maybe tell me what some of these symptoms could be it would be great
1	also , i have felt almost as if my insides are vibrating a little , only when i lay on my side at night

1	putting it sincerely , i had no idea what sex is , all that made me worried at that time was , brother was mothers pet always

1	My boyfriend and i broke up a few months ago
1	  we were together for 2 years I m pregnant and he has ben playing games like one day i m the most important thing in his life
1	then next i m devalued to the point where he ignores me and acts like i m a bad person
1	The other day i went to the hospital to make sure my baby was ok and RIGHT afterward i went over to his house and just walked in
1	they were nt doing anything but the tv was off and they were sitting really close
1	we talked and he told me that he kissed her 3 weeks ago which was right when we started talking about getting back together and hanging out and stuff
1	so obviously he is nt ready to be with me even though he acts soo emotional when i m not around
1	and when i ca nt talk to him he gets sooo upset and blows up my phone
1	then when he has other people around i m not so important anyone and it turns into me blowing up his phone
1	So i was surfing the web and of course i am not a doctor but i found an article on BPD   borderline personality disorder and the symptoms , the reason that the disorder usually arises , everything matches
1	it says in there that one day they idolize the person and the next they become devalued
1	So my question is there is no way i can tell him to go get counciling because i ve already tried to tell him to but he does nt think he needs help , i changed my number and i m trying to decide if i should stand by him or if i should just leave
1	i m pregnant and this emotional roller coaster ca nt be healthy for me or my baby but at the same time i love him
1	i ca nt handle this constant radical behavior but when i m not around him i feel so alone
1	I 've had anxiety issues in the past , so I am quite familiar with mental illness , and wha it can do to you
1	There have been times when my anxiety gets so bad I feel like I ca n't function , and I avoid doing everything , and even avoid people on purpose
1	During these times , I may not feel good , not sick but sluggish and blah , yet exercise , yoga really seem to help , as well as CBT , and i 've had my anxiety under control for a long time now
1	I love life , I love keeping busy , seeing my friends and family as often as possible , doing activities , I enjoy my job I work in philanthropy , no stress , very nice coworkers , I have no reason to unhappy
1	Last year I was diagnosed with endometriosis and told I needed to have surgery to remove an ovarian cyst , Obvisouly this was devestating news , not to mention my anxiety issues have often been about control , so being knocked out for a surgery with an unpredictable outcome will I lose my ovary or not
1	I spent three days in the hospital , but it never went away
1	I never had so much as a stomach ache in my life , now I felt pain and bloating verytime I ate , I had acid reflux , I could n't have alcohol , and it started to tire me out , as if the virus was n't going away
1	After months of tests it was concluded I had mild chronic gastritis and frutose intolerance as a result of postinfectious IBS
1	Before my surgery in July I started getting tired more easily
1	I had little energy and difficulty staying awake all day
1	I had the surgery and was told I 'd be back at work atfer two weeks
1	After the durgery , I felt so relieved and proud of myself for having gotten over my greatest fear , and was so excited to heal and get back to my life
1	I could n't return to work , I was in bed fr like 20 hours a day
1	I started taking iron pills which were suppose to give me back my energy
1	I admit , if someone who had a history of anxiety and suddenly complained of being tired all the time without any medcal reason , I too would assume depression
1	To me , people are depressed andare tired because they lost interest in things
1	this is not my case , I have been surprisingly positive and optimitic about tomorrow I 'll have more energy , but it never happens
1	I am dying to get back to work , be productive agan , excerise , go outdoors , walk my dogs , etc
1	If I have a good day when my stomach does n't hurt too badly and I have some energy to do something , I spend the next couple of days in bed recovering
1	I 've been doing relaxation yoga , acupunture , osteopathy , massage therapy , aromatherapy , meditation , everything that I think of to heal , but there has been improvmnt
1	When I am feeling anxious , these things aways make me feel better
1	The feeling to me is really similar to when you have a bad cold and as much as you want to do something , your body just gives up and tells you to go to bed and rest
1	Taking pain relievers really do n’t relieve me of my pain
1	I ’m afraid of all the people I will hurt in the process
1	My mom , my dad , my whole family , my friends , my teachers , my community
1	I want to just get away from all this but I ca n’t because I ’m too much of a wimp
1	There is n’t anyone in my friends that I can relate to , They are all happy and busy
1	and what I do today will affect what I get tomorrow
1	Like I ’m not feeling the emotions I feel right now
1	I ’m getting Cs and Ds for every single subject
1	Because I ca n’t remember anything that I wanthave to remember
1	I do n’t want that to happen I ’ve already been to the hospital for so much of my life
1	I hit my head and cut my head when I was little … I ’ve had to do stuff to my legs because I kept falling so much … I got my wisdom teeth pulled … It ’s just too stressful
1	I ca nt concentrate on anything therefore I ca n’t do anything productive without drawing my attention to something else
1	I feel like I need to take more pain relievers
1	I wo n’t cure me
1	Leaving to a better place is what I where I want to be right now
1	On the other hand , I want to say “ Goodbye world , now I can go to another place ” For now , I ’ll just have to wipe away those tears
1	I do n't know if this will help but I 'm 15
1	Hi my name is Nikki , I just wanted to give you my input on your situationLast year in may , I experienced the same effects that you have
1	I had a large lump on my left clavicle bone , it felt like I had worked out too hard and it was sore
1	So I went to the doctor and had an MRI and a biopsy and they found a tumor that had created IN my clavicle bone causing the boe itself to shatter
1	At one point , the tumor specialist believed that I had cancer , but it just turned out to be a tumor AKA ABC
1	The doctors had to cut half of my clavicle bone offbut it did not effect any movement of my arm
1	It took me two weeks to recover , and know I have a minor scar on my left shoulder
1	I strongly suggest that you have your clavicle looked at , maybe you could save it before it could potentially shatter your boneGood luck
1	You can reach me at hawaii208This discussion is related to Lump on clavicle bone
1	My adult step children blame their dad for not being there for them and are jealous of my children for being raised by him
1	I get told give me time with them
1	His oldest daughter now 40 still has alot of hate toward me for what she said taking him away from them
1	I did n't even know there dad when he left their mom
1	His youngest daughter is now 27 and just started after he dad went to the hospital for a possible heart attack that I called them and told them he was was in the hospital that she started coming around
1	But she said she still does not trust him
1	I even told my husbans if these where not your children but other adults whould you treat them with kid gloves and let them continue blaming you for past of the past
1	He said no but they are differant and He needs time for them to trust him
1	We have been together for since about 1988
1	All the kids are grown and my children said If they ever treated their step dad like this they know they would get an ear ful as an adult not as a child with kid gloves
1	I had a pretty turbulent relationship spanning over three years , involving everything from jealousy , infidelity , drugs , lies , you name it
1	We almost had an unexpected baby but my girlfriend miscarriaged about 3 weeks later and we tried to carry on as if nothing had changed , even though I demanded she give the child up for adoption due to our life issues at the time
1	My paranoia drove her away , she cheated , I rebelled , it basically started this whole unhealthy cycle pretty much revolving around sex and perscription drugs
1	Do n't get me wrong , I loved her unlike any other person in my life but I was also sort of crazy at the time and could n't harness my emotions
1	At that time , I had just impregnated her and I would n't find out for about 2 or 3 weeks later
1	I knew this time adoption was out of the question and asking her to get an abortion was equally unrealistic , but somehow we went 2 separate time to an abortion clinic where she would then change her mind
1	The entire process was agonizing for both of us , and she ultimately decided to go through with it , me funding the operating and driving her back to my apartment where I planned to care for her for a period of time until we could resume our lives with normalcy
1	We tried again to go back to normal , but shortly thereafter , my youngert cousin died in a tragic car accident , prompting me to fly home and attend his funeral
1	In short , we never really digested the entire thing and now 45 years later , it still plagues me with depressive phases
1	Despite having separated and gone our own ways , we are on good terms and she does n't resent me nor I , her
1	She has a son now with another guy and that 's probably a factor in my depression
1	I often compare my materialistic life in Los Angeles with her domestic family life and feel empty and isolated in the end
1	I have had relationships since her , but none as close
1	So I guess my question is , is it common for men to suffer depression as a result of an aborted child
1	Am i answering my own question here
1	I 'm 18 and was 13 first time I got depressed
1	I started treating and was taking Lexapro , and was doing ok Then , when my doctor decidem to take off my med , everything came back , but a bilion times worse
1	It all started with nausea and headaches that kept getting stronger , I had to go to hospital because of them
1	Right now I 'm taking Pristiq , Lyrica and Seroquel XRO
1	By a month ago , I started think in a really weird way , I ca n't even explain right
1	and I keep overanalyzing every of them
1	Also , I 'm pretty freaked out about veins and ca n't stop thinking about them , it 's driving me crazy
1	I also think too much about existential stuff , and that lead me to find life meaningless , I ca n't understand why we exist , why we use languages , why things are the way they are , etc
1	I think I am really close of going insane
1	I think that even if I get cured , if I just remember my thoughts it will all start all over again
1	I think I 'll never be abe to get these stuff solves , as I ca n't even explain it properly , and want to kill myself
1	I used to be religious , but I find now impossible to believing anything
1	I am confused about everything and nothing in this world makes sense to me
1	I feel also that I ca n't love anymore
1	My parents are really stressed and I feel so guilty , I think about going to a psychiatric hospital to leave them alone
1	I ca n't figure out what I want , what I know and what I think
1	Since the age of 13 I 've been in and out of psych hospitals
1	Reasons began from cutting , and now its been because I feel like I literally do n't exist
1	The feeling of non existence took over my life very recently , even though now I 'm remembering I 've always had this
1	But thing is , for about 2 weeks straight last month , I truly believed I was an imaginary being trapped in a human body
1	For years , I 'm remembering now , I would feel like I would forget how to smile , and it would happen randomly
1	Last month , I had an episode where I could n't feel emotion
1	I caught myself rite away , I know about the echo I 've seen severe cases of schizophrenia
1	I 'm the only one who takes the time to talk to him , cuz in a way I 've felt like that before
1	I 've been doing that for years
1	And there a voice named alice , who speaks to me through my thougts
1	She wants me to help her cuz she died in a forest
1	She came to me at age 13
1	Can get annoying at times but I guess I like her
1	And I always believe the trees are trying to tell me something
1	Even when I 'm not scared or panicy , I 'm still waiting to wake up , cuz I 'm part of a greater consciousness I refer to as greater being me
1	I think she put me here as a joke or maybe to learn something , but idk
1	So after all that , I guess what I 'm asking is , is anyone who is diagnosed with schizophrenia now able to relate to a slow onset
1	I have a stepson who has to stay with us due to his parole
1	He is in his late 20 's and has alot of issues
1	First off he is married , his wife and son live in a different state
1	When I met my now husband , his son was in jail
1	I met him when he got out about a year later
1	He only uses his father for a place to stay
1	He leaves dirty dishes in the sink , his room smells , he drinks way to much and he walks around as if to say this is my father 's house not yours
1	I said no alcohol in the house , so he has his father take him to go get it and bring it in
1	My husband gets mad at me but says he feels the same way
1	If we tell him to get out he will be back in jail
1	My stepson 's reply is I have a job , What I ca n't have a beer
1	My husband said I put up with your son for 4 years and did not say anything
1	Yes , that 's true but he is a good kid now on his own
1	Not one minutes trouble with alcohol , drugs , girls and no trouble with the law   I really lucked out
1	I am at my wits end
1	My husband and I have not talked in 2 days , and I want to fly solo
1	You may think I am wrong but , I do n't love anyone enough to go through this hell
1	Hi , my name is Samantha and I 'm this is my first post
1	I 'm not sure if I have BPD but recently I have been feeling very manic about my recent breakup
1	If anyone is willing to read and comment on my story I would be extremely grateful
1	I guess with my relationship to my ex
1	I met Cory through a mutual friend in while visiting Boston
1	At the time I was going to school is Chicago , but was extremely depressed with everything
1	My choice in a major , my friendships , and the boyfriend I had at the time I 'll discuss this later
1	He was really into me and that 's what I wanted at the time
1	We slept together after the first night of meeting , and then I went back to Chicago
1	We talked everyday for about two months , and then he flew out to see me
1	I was so happy with him , so happy to have someone who really liked me
1	I eventually decided to leave Chicago and move to Boston
1	I just wanted to take a year off and start my life over
1	I thought he loved me enough that we would be together for a while
1	I then moved in with him last January
1	It was n't a great decision but my lease was up , and I was n't really looking anywhere else
1	I just wanted to be with him
1	Long story short , Cory , myself , and two other friends got a house together in September , A month into living together Cory and I broke up
1	I do n't know how to explain my feelings
1	I love him , but I am constantly annoyed with him
1	There are so many things about him that I just wish he would do differently , like how he treats me , but I know that 's impossible
1	I was hanging on to it because I love him , and I love the stability
1	He basically was really rude to me for the last month we were together
1	I tried and tried but I knew I was just annoying him
1	The thing is , I moved into the extra room we had in the house
1	We have still been living together since September
1	And we have been sleeping together since our breakup
1	This stems from a past relationship where my boyfriend cheated on me for a year and a half I check his phone constantly , and feel such guilt about it
1	Then I get angry at him for those reasons and we discuss it
1	Recently I 've realized I do n't want to sleep with him
1	I love knowing that he wants to be around me
1	I do n't understand his feelings
1	My real question is this Cory is moving to Boston next month
1	He is insistent on remaining friends , because he does n't have any and I am the only one really close to him
1	But I do n't think I can do it
1	I feel like this is my opportunity to cut him off
1	I cry every day thinking about us
1	I love him more than anything , but I know he does n't love me the same , so I also hate him like I ca n't even explain
1	I hate him for not loving me as much , I hate him for not treating me well
1	Should I continue talking to him
1	I want him to want me , so it 's going to be difficult to not initiate conversation all of the time
1	I 'm sick of being pushed around and I think that 's what he 's doing , wanting to remain friends
1	It makes me not want to get out of bed , it makes me want to harm myself I 'm a cutter and bulimic , I need to get over him and to do that I think I should cut it off for good
1	I was on Fluoxetine 10 mg for about 6 weeks , and I did n't feel anything , so I raised it to 20 mg
1	After just few days , I started to feel huge improvements in my depression problems , OCD , and specially social anxiety
1	After about a month , I visited my psychiatrist again , and he advised me to raise it to 40 mg
1	For some reasons , plus the fact that I did not trust him much , I did something foolish
1	So I stopped taking Fluoxetine , waited 4 days , and then started taking Sertraline 50 mg
1	It 's been 8 days now so 12 days from stopping Fluoxetine , and I 'm gradually having my depression , OCD and social anxiety back
1	I do n't want my suicidal thoughts come back , because it hurts me so much
1	Besides that , I 'm having insomnia or maybe it 's a change in sleep cycle , idk , plus sexual dysfunction , and I my eyes often go black when I stand up
1	Please do n't advise me talking to the psychiatrist , that 's not an option for me right now
1	Some of the reasons I decided to change to Sertraline   I was having lowered blood pressure with Fluoxetine
1	  While on Fluoxetine , I did n't have much difficulties falling asleep , but the quality of the sleep was awful
1	  My brother , who has problems similar to mine , has had not a good experience with high doses of Fluoxetine , and said that Sertraline is working much better for him
1	  Whenever I take Metoclopramide , which is a Dopamine antagonist , it makes me awfully depressed
1	So I thought maybe I have some problems with my Dopamine levels
1	I do n't have anybody who cares about me The times I 've said that to people I 'm always told it must not be truethat of course people care
1	I do n't have siblings and my parents divorced when I was 2
1	My dad left and is remarried now to a woman who ca n't stand me , so I do n't get to see him anymore
1	My mother 's always told me to be more like other peoplethat I 'm not good enough
1	I moved far away for school and I guess I was just forgotten about
1	Nobody has included me in things for years and if I 'm not the one who makes the effort , I do n't hear from people for years literally I 've been feeling so alone and it 's getting harder every day
1	Professionally , I do n't have a futureuniversity marks were just released and I did n't do well
1	All of my usedtobe close friends are moving on and progressing and I 'm in this stagnant place wo a future
1	If I go to the other side of town I used to live there and have my doctors , mechanic , friends there he immediately accuses me of any and everything
1	If I visit with my neighbor I 'm in cahoots with her and talking about him
1	He is constantly raising his voice and comes up with the most out of this world accusationsnone of them true
1	If I stand up for myself then he says I 'm donewe need to figure out what we are going to do meaning divorce
1	I tell him go for it   because actually I really do n't care anymore
1	Last nite he got home at 1030 no call no nothingI asked him where he had been and his response was oh here and there   then he started putting his supper together I had eaten at 6 like a normal person all the while grumbling I guess I 'm on my own   what I was thinking was DAMN RIGHT   I honestly have only hate for him
1	I know it sounds bad , but he has brought it on
1	A little while ago I called him because my check engine light is on and I have to take my car through emissions and I did n't know if I should just take it to my mechanic first or try to get it through emissions
1	So I put a call in to my mechanic had to leave a message   then dear hubby calls back and I tell him why I had called , but that I had called my mechanic and that I would probably take my car to emissions and if it fails then my mechanic is less than 18 mile away
1	He immediately throws a tantrum and tells me I 'm being stupid , and that why do I want to go all the way to the other side of town when I can get emissions out where we live
1	Well , first I did n't even know there was an emissions place out here , and second if it fails I have to go to the other side of town to my mechanic anyway
1	At which time he responds whateverthere 's more to this than you 're telling medo what ever you want   I simply hung up
1	Okay so on the 11th July 2009 my best friend tried to take an overdose whilst on the phone to me , she was screaming and crying hysterically , to this day her screams are chilling for me
1	I remained calm on the phone to her demanding her address to send the police over , upon calling the police , I managed to get her address out of her and they turned up in which seemed a hour
1	Still screaming and crying I demanded she opened the door
1	I asked to speak to the police officers and told them to keep me informed
1	Eventually I decided to call back her house phone at 6 pm to see if there was any news , the police were speaking to her and she was having her stomach pumped
1	Shortly after I received a phone call from the police , telling me she 'd swallowed 2632 tablets and if she was left any longer this would be a total different situation fatal
1	The next day I saw her Facebook status about her being home so I rang her , spoke to her and told her I 'm here and whatever she needs I 'll try my best to get
1	I was angry though , not with her , with the boy who put her in that state
1	Her dad walked in and asked who she was on the phone to , saying me , I told her to pass the phone to him , he thanked me for taking the action I took and I asked him to keep a close eye on her
1	To this day not a week goes by that I do n't think about her , think about that date and think about how much I hate the person who put her in that situation
1	I get tears in my eyes because thinking about it is hard , because I hear her screams
1	We hardly talk these days and I send her the odd message , asking if she 's well because I do n't like the thought of her trying that again
1	I 've not really told anyone this because I find it hard to speak about it but I needed to get this off my chest
1	Hi , i m a 21 yr old single mother to a 2 yr old little boy named Shaun
1	His father has had nothing to do with him and has nt even seen him
1	He wanted me to abort him , and i chose not to
1	So i m now engaged to the love of my life however he is in the military and in california right now
1	I love every minute of it but there are times I worry i m not doing as good as i could be
1	I m trying to potty train him now and he is doing ok , but not as good as i would like , does anyone have any good tips
1	but when it comes to dinner time and he does nt want to eat I do nt force himis this bad
1	He has a horrible appetite he hates eating there are times i try to force him but it never works and i get so frustrated
1	he weighs 36 lbs and just turned 2 so i do nt think he is under weight
1	Now as for his sleeping situation , He will not sleep in his bed , he wants to sleep in his play pen next to my bed , and if i do nt let him he is up just about all night crying so i caved and let him and he sleeps ALL night

1	I refused this situation and decided to leave him and i told him wer over u can stay with the other onehe want crazy and mad he started threatening me he also said he would rape me , since i live in a country where girls rnt allow to lose their virginity before mariage , he offered to take my virginity away from me next time if he saw mehe even threatened me to hurt me and someone from my familyat that point i was so scared i dnt deny this fact , but i never let him win and take whatever he wanted
1	I , myself , threatened him that i would show all of his bad messages which contain all of his threatening words to the police and they will arrest him for that and throw him in jail if he just think about comming near me or anyone of my familymy story did nt take years of painful memoriesit all happened in just one monthbut i can assure u it was heck of a month i still have nightmares till now bcz of it

1	I 'm 14 years old and I have ADHD , OCD , ODD , and Bipolar disorder
1	So my mother moved out and rented an apartment with her new boyfriend
1	For about a week I lived with her and her boyfriend , it was n't good
1	He threatened me and also drank and almost overdosed on sleeping medication
1	He had a seizure on the kicthen floor and all I could do is run to the bathroom and cry
1	So my mother sent me to live with my father who I have a little hostility for because he has taken me off of my medication 2 times which cause me to be sent to a hospital twice , once for 12 days and the other for 3 months out of state
1	So I thought living with my father and stepmother would be terrible
1	Well I was right , but I had underestimated how bad it is
1	My father and stepmother constantly tell me I 'm worthless and I ca n't do anything right
1	Because I 'm on medication for my disorders , they call me a pill popper and jacked up
1	About a few weeks ago , my twin sister was ill and had been sick for about 3 days
1	She did n't want to go out to register for school and asked if she could go that friday
1	He violently grabbed her and dragged her through the house
1	Upon hearing my sister crying and screaming I rushed in and told him to let go of her
1	He threw her out of the house and grabbed me by my wrist and threw me out as well
1	He said the following I do n't want you in my house
1	We ran off into the woods by their house and cried and huddled together until he left
1	Luckily I had kept a water bottle in my backpack and we filled it up with hose water
1	I later called a hotline for troubled teens and they suggested to call child services
1	So to make sure I was making the right decision I went to see the school councler
1	What he said was shocking to me
1	He told me that what my father did was right
1	So I have thought about calling child services but the only problem is that my father and stepmother can hide anything
1	I have no one to turn to and I do n't belong to a church so I can not talk to a pastor
1	I pretty much and on the verge of wanting to run away and just keep running until I can not see him ever again
1	Is there any way I can get help for me and my sister
1	Right now I am on the schools computer because I have no internet at my father 's house and I am grounded and exiled from talking to my mother , and pretty much seeing the light of day other than being at school
1	I am grounded because I am unorganized and I need help from a teacher
1	My father blames me for everything that happens when sometimes I can not control the situation
1	I 've never been able to advocate for myself so I get walked all over by anyone
1	I have no support system and I can not find anyone who will listen
1	My brother is 21 years old , and he has been displaying symptoms of schizophrenia
1	Within a 3 weeks , we have been noticing significant changes in my brother 's mood , higher agression , laughing and talking to himself , violence , extremely moody
1	Roughly 610 months ago we have noticed signs of depression since he lost his job , and girlfriend , so he has just been at home on the computer every single
1	This past week , my brother has made lifethreathening threats to my mother and father , calling them evil , and devils , and how my mother killed people in the past
1	It also seems as if he hallucinates since he goes outside various times late at night and just sits and talks to someone nobody
1	Currently he is withheld in a county jail for making threats such as almost striking my father with a rock
1	and my brother has no health insurance so will he be liable to be treated , medicated , or able to see a psychiatrist
1	what can my family and I do
1	I m a 15 year old girl
1	Mostly nothing to unusual , but since my parents are going through divorce , I found stuff out , and you know
1	I 'll explain from the first day
1	About a year ago , my mom started changing , though she was still married to my dad , she started going out with other guys , and I figured out that she 'd be paid for it
1	On top of that , I met one of the guys , who she was really close with
1	Hell , he proposed to her
1	This guy had a HUGE influence on my mom , he got her into drinking , she 's now a terrible alcoholic , and even smoking
1	Which of course , drove my mom insane , she is drinking more then ever , and I 'm pretty sure she is depressed
1	She 'll always get mad at me for no reason , she 'll shove and yell at me , and has become a terrible liar , and lies and blames me for everything , which gets me in trouble with my dad
1	She did meet another girl , who 's she s best friends with , which she 'll do anything for , my mom will constantly go out with this woman , she even tried to adopt her friends niece
1	Which of course , I did nt take well , I tried to tel her I do nt like this girl , and instead I got the boot
1	I left for a few days to get away
1	But because of my dad I had to come back
1	But other then my family reasons why I think I might be depressed
1	I 'm addicted to cutting , slicing open my skin
1	My arms , from shoulder to wrist , my thighs , hips , ankles , stomach
1	I 've been cutting for a few months
1	I love it , and I ca n't stop
1	I know exactly where to slit my wrist to kill myself , and I 'm slowly bringing up the courage to do it
1	So , I know I wo nt be terribly missed if I were to die , But still
1	My mother has told me to killcut myself more then once , even in public
1	We were out to eat a month or so ago and she gracefully mentioned that I should cut my wrists open with the knife next to me
1	I 've been cutting slower , with the end of my razor , about 3 to 4 mm deep
1	I 've cut to see the yellow fat in my thighs a few times , but it 's usually to the purpleish skin
1	I defiantly can hear skin snap and break when I cut
1	I used to have a friend who also back stabbed be , she told everyone she knew I was a suicidal cutter
1	And I was constantly texted or messages about it , and they said , some nasty things
1	I 've been seeing my therapist and councilor at school , my therapist wants me on antidepressants and mood stabilizers , But my mom wo n't let me go to the doctor
1	If you want for information on my thoughts , or anything , Please ask away
1	I know I 'll get the courage to hurt myself too far one day
1	I 'm tired of being strong , but I 'm scared that I ca n't fix myself and make myself stop
1	The only person stopping me is my dad
1	He 'd have no one if I 'm gone
1	Hi , I have a pretty long , complex question , but it 's causing me a little stress , so I 'd be grateful if someone would kindly read the whole thing and give me an answer
1	My girlfriend and I got intimate on the the 5th day of her menstrual cycle which usually lasts anywhere from 2429 days
1	We usually go down on each other , and we are very careful to prevent my ejaculatory fluids from touching her pubic area
1	However , about 45 minutes before my girlfriend came over to my place , i was thinking about her and subconsciously rubbed myself through my pants I was wearing boxers underneath AND pants on top for about 23 minutes
1	When I realized I was rubbing myself , I immediately stopped as I wanted to keep my hands clean and did not want to ejaculate
1	I looked at my fingers and they looked dry , but when I smelt them , they smelt a bit musty
1	I had not ejaculated for a whole week prior to this , so could there have been sperm on my finger
1	I quickly rubbed my fingers on my shirt for a few seconds to be safe
1	Anyway , when my girlfriend came over , I directly went down on her with my mouth and NEVER touched her pubic region vulva , vagina etc with my fingers
1	I went down on her three times , and in between , we would cuddle and make out
1	After going down on her the third time , I just picked her panties up off the floor and handed them over to her to wear
1	I do n't know for sure where on the panties I touched it
1	Is there a risk of transferring sperm from my finger to her panties
1	It had been more than one and a half hours since I had subconsciously touched myself , and my fingers must have touched many things in that time , from my shirt , to her clothes , to her face and upper body , the bedsheet , floor etc , though I NEVER touched her vaginal area
1	She wiped up her pubic region with a tissue paper before putting on the panties
1	After she wore her panties and jeans , she gave me a handjob , ensuring that the semen did not fall on her
1	It was the fifth day of her cycle so I hope that 's a safe day
1	I have been in an emotionally abusive relationship with my wife for the past 15 years
1	I have only very recently several days ago begun to understand what this really means and how some of the destructive aspects of this relationship seem to work
1	I do n’t believe that what I ’m about to describe has ever been witnessed by anyone except me and my wife
1	We have lived together for 15 years and have been married for the last 10 years
1	My wife and I are both intelligent and educated people who are generally wellregarded by those around us
1	We are deeply involved in a continuing cycle of emotional violence that manifests itself like this I will say something some comment , observation , remark , etc
1	to my wife and she does not respond , neither verbally nor by using a gesture or some other body motion
1	Since there is no response from her I usually will ask her something like , Did you hear what I said
1	When the cycle of violence is active she will continue to ignore me as if I were ‘ invisible’ and ‘ mute’ , but I need to stress that this cycle does n't take place every time I say something to her
1	I feel it must be something that is somehow threatening her , but that ’s just speculation since I really ca n’t know what ’s happening in her mind
1	If the cycle is active and I am ignored for a second time , then my fear of abandonment which I have carried with me since childhood intensifies and ‘ hijacks’ my higher mental processes
1	My fear takes over and then begins to drive my anger
1	I then punish and abuse her verbally
1	I am outraged that the woman who loves and supports and obviously cherishes me in so many different ways could treat me so shabbilyand I tell her so , in no uncertain terms
1	I verbally cut my wife to shreds
1	When I begin to attack her verbally , she quickly makes it obvious to me that I am no longer ‘ invisible’ or ‘ mute’
1	She will begin to return my verbal abuse with angry secondary abuse , which takes the form of an attempt to deflect any responsibility for her behavior , quite often by attempting to blame me for starting the whole thing
1	She verbally indicates to me that she is justified in her behavior and thus justified in abusing me
1	This only increases my anger and round and round we go
1	I ’m not sure when the cycle really ends though , because if my wife attempts an apology after we ’ve cooled down some it generally takes the form of “ I ’m sorry I ca n’t be better for you ” and “ I ’m sorry I ca n’t do things the way you want me to do them ” Emphasis hers
1	Perhaps I ’m being insensitive , but these do n’t sound much like apologies to me
1	The first one sounds like she ’s saying “ It ’s unfortunate that you feel like you ’re being abused ” and the second one sounds like “ I think you ’re being unreasonable to object to my abuse of you ”
1	My wife seems unable to even acknowledge the damage she causes , much less truly apologize for it
1	The good part of me recognizes how damaging this behavior is , but the bad part of me ca n’t seem to stop it
1	I want to stress that I do n’t feel that this description is necessarily 100 accurate or complete , due to my lack of objectivity , but I strongly feel that , at the very least , something similar to this must be occurring
1	I am 100 responsible for the damage I cause in this cycle of violence
1	I am guilty of inflicting horrific , repeated damage on the woman that I love
1	My wife does not cause me to react to her the way I do
1	The responsibility for my reaction is solely mine , and I need to start taking positives steps to keep this from happening ever again
1	I am actively seeking an individual therapist who can help me overcome the effects of my wife ’s abuse as well as help me cope with my fear of abandonment
1	I feel that I am finally ready and able to work with a competent therapist to address these and any other issues that I may subsequently discover during my therapy
1	Hi all , to keep my problems short and sweet , can anybody diagnose what is up with me
1	here 's my symptoms Constant worry about my health Up till 3am5am each night and waking up between 1pm3pm Ca n't concentrate and thick headed Constant worry about heart attacksstrokes From being skinny to having a beer belly , makes it hard to fully breathe at times when i sleep anxiety attacks after i drink at the weekend Lifestyle Sacked from work September 2013

1	Thank you Eddie
1	My little cousin is 7 years old
1	His dad is veryyyy strict and very abusive towards him , his 12 year old sister and his wife
1	I 'm going to the main topic so , this 7 years old kid , I caught him watching porn several times , and the history on his tablet is just full of inappropriate videos and images
1	He makes inappropriate moves with his sis or any other female when no one is around
1	His sister went to me and cried because he was asking her to remove her top
1	He always get off his pants and just makes a very disgusting moves , he asked my sister when she will be getting her top off , he always opens the door on his sister whenever she 's showring or changing her clothes
1	His dad once caught him watching inappropriate videos but as I said , he 's really abusive , he would n't let him go to school for 2 weeks , locked his room , gives him his food to his room and wo n't let him out only if he wants to use the bathroom
1	I do n't want to tell his dad because good things wo nt happen to this little kid , I mean he hits him with a huge stick when he makes something wrong , and he makes so much things that are scary
1	I told his mom , she told him and explained to him that this is inappropriate for his age and are bad forr him
1	I do n't know what to do , and I 'm shocked that how would a 7 year old kid knows about porn and things kids should n't know about , I guess kid are n't innocent anymore these days
1	I have a lot of anger and resentment for what my spouse is doing
1	We have been married 34 years and now he is involved with a 24 year old he ’s 56
1	We attended church and married under the Christian covenant with me believing the union was until death
1	I feel like my husband has died and another person has taken over his personality
1	I kicked him out of our house in April after finding his cell phone bill and seeing how many times a day he was calling her and knowing he was sneaking around to see her
1	He moved into another house that we own
1	Two months ago I saw him right across the street from the house where I still reside , with his harlot
1	Due to her extreme irresponsibility of being evicted so many times he rented the house for her
1	It has been devastating seeing his car parked across the street when he comes to pick her up for their datesoutings or when he spends the nights there
1	This summer the county ended up taking her two illegitmate children away from her due to her addiction
1	My spouse used to spend more time with her kids then his own family even to taking them to DisneyWorld in Florida
1	She does n’t work , whereas I spent all of our marriage working outside the home
1	He totally supports her including buying her cigarettes , when he used to say that smokers were scum of the earth
1	She has been arrested for theft and has even stolen from her family members
1	I just do n't get his attraction to her
1	My spouse and I were still communicating until recently
1	He told me this week that he no longer wants anything to do with me and I need to contact a lawyer for a dissolution
1	Our two daughters are n’t happy with what he is doing but yet they wo n’t confront him about it
1	I ’m the one who gets the backlash on how I should just let it go and get on with my life
1	After investing all those years , I feel lost , alone and wondering what it is I did to deserve being trreated like a speck of dirt
1	i 'm an eighteen year old and have just entered my last year in high school
1	I have now come to terms with the fact that I am depressed and have been for a while
1	Depression runs in my family both my grandmother and my uncle suffer from extreme depression while another uncle is bipolar
1	I have a very bad relationship with my mother
1	she is verbally abusive towards me and makes me feel crap and unworthy
1	I think its the way she was brought up
1	She has never once told me she loved me but has made me cry almost every single day of my life
1	I feel especially bad for my younger brother who is only 7 and is already angry at the world and acts out constantly
1	its the way my mother treats him
1	and i have learnt to behave in the same way   I have nobody to talked to because a went back a grade and all my friends from my class have left for university
1	I have not made any friends in my new class
1	BTW i live in a country where depression is a taboo topic and where there are n't many specialists that i can talk to so therapy is n't really a viable option
1	WHAT DO I DOO
1	I am a 52 year old woman , who had a total hysterectomy 2 years ago
1	This may sound stupid but I did not know my ovaries were going to be removed
1	It was a total surprise to me and I was very distraught
1	When I woke up from the surgery and they ask me how I felt , the first thing I said was I feel odd , like something is not right
1	I did not find out my ovaries were removed until about 8 weeks later
1	I was having a nervous breakdown and ask the doctor to check my hormones
1	he said you do n't have any
1	Now I am faced with trying to regulate my body chemistry
1	For over a year I felt like I was going crazy
1	I am taking Estrogen shots once every 3 weeks
1	But I bought some Black Cohosh and some progestin cream so I think I m going to try that
1	If I do n't feel a whole lot better I m going back to the doctor and see if he can help me feel better
1	I do n't like taking the shots because of the health riskt I must also consider quality of life
1	I do feel better in the last 6 months
1	I just do n't feel as good as I did before the surgery and I m convinced it has to do with getting your hormones properly regulated
1	One more thing , my hair is much thinner than it was , so I m fighting that battle also
1	Either it happened quickly or I did n't notice till the night before yesterday
1	It is right in between the top and bottom rows of my teeth but sitting right behind the last teeth just enough that my teeth does not bite it when my teeth are clenched together
1	Using my tongue to feel the area , it seems to be popping out and hanging out , and it 's hard , compared to my left side which is smooth and soft
1	I can slip my tongue under the piece of meat and my tongue would touch that area which tastes like a regular ulcer
1	I do n't know about other people , but whenever my tongue to touches a mouth ulcer , my tongue receives this tingling taste or feeling
1	I I looked in the mirror with a flash light and noticed that in the center of the swollen area , the texture seems to be a little different
1	i recently got divorced after being married for 3 years , but had been with him for nearly 13 we have 3 children together
1	he was emotionally abusive to me for most of that time , but it was n't the obvious abuse , and i was n't aware that that is what it was
1	he was extremely difficult to live with , and i had finally had enough and ended up leaving everything and spending 4 days in the mental health unit at the hospital
1	i 've been very sick for the last several years and i was n't the best mom i suppose
1	my kids are healthy and happy , and that s what counts to me
1	they went to school , they are extremely smart , they got fed , had clean clothes , had whatever they needed
1	but my ex put me down so often that i started to feel and believe that i was completely worthless
1	my self worth became dependent on how clean the house was , which was n't as bad as he would make people believe , except for me
1	so i finally got away from him , but had to give up physical custody of my kids because i did not have a stable home for them , nor was i emotionally stable to take care of them
1	they had a home they were comfortable in and i did not want to take them away from that
1	my ex is extremely controlling and manipulative and has absolutely no problem in bringing up all my supposed shortcomings in his opinion , but they are unbelievably painful , and he does it in front of my kids
1	me and the kids have great relationships , and even though i visit only 3 days a week , i spend more time with them than he does , but they are not allowed at my home because of my current relationship , and only because he 's allowing his personal feelings to get in the way
1	now , even though its been almost a year , i still can not be around him or talk to him without experiencing nearly paralyzing anxiety and just can not seem to defend myself
1	i see a counselor at a domestic violence shelter every week , but am realizing that i need more help than that
1	I have now been with spouse several years and more and more believe he is bpd after reading stories posted on internet
1	He never got very physically abusive with me until I was 7 and12 months pregnantvery verbally abusive though
1	He drug me down the hallway by hair in front of his son and hit me
1	Things are always my fault because I think I am perfectfar from that
1	Howeverthe yoyo effect has gotten worse again and my son is now old enough that it effects him
1	When daddy does not get his waythings get verbally abusive and then leads to him kicking me out of the house and then threatening suicide if I do n't come back
1	How am I suppose to help support my husband in getting help when he thinks nothing is wrong with him and keep my son safe
1	Right now I let him come visit whenever he wantsbut this is now not enough for himbut he has not taken me to court yet
1	I 've been told I have enough evidence that he would never get him aloneI am terrified for my toddler
1	I was nt quite sure where to post this , or if i even should post this , but i have to ask someone and this is the only place i can go to for help or advice becasue when i tell my mom she thinks i m making it up , and when i told her i was depressed she blamed herself soo
1	Okay my uncle was bipolarreally , really bipolar , he was put into a hospital and it runs in the family right
1	anyway i went to the doctor last year for my depression and he said i had clinical depression but i did nt wanna go to a therapist so i just did nt go back and i still have my depression problems although i do nt harm myself anymore and i do nt have suicidal thoughts as frequently
1	But my depression has developed into something that seems for like bipolar disorder than anything else cuz i have random highs and then i get really depressed and i do nt do drugs , nor am i on any perscribed medication BUT onto the schitzo stuff XD I heard that being bipolar you can also have halutionations , so maybe i m not schizophrenic but i ca nt help but wonder , i m paraniod of alot of things including mirrors , bathrooms and 300 AM , 300 because i more often than not wake up around that time every night and hear things and see things
1	like angry little girls in my room , heavy footsteps that sound like boots , i hear the same melody over and over againbe it from an icecream truck or a fly and various other things like my mom saying i sing to myself at night around that time During the day quite often i see blue flashes of light around me , like something flying by , and i sometimes hear these odd screaching sounds that sound like some kind of like phoenix
1	I see people in the corner of my eye that were never there and i ve found scratches on myself that were most definatley not casued by my cats , i would nt call it ' hearing voices ' but there s a constant line of chatter going on in my head , they argue alot , and each one is like a different person
1	I have a feeling i m not doing so well mentally and i m only 14 , help
1	please do nt call me immature , i m not making this up , i just want help
1	I got engaged a few months ago
1	My fiance is my soul mate
1	We gel very well with each other and I love him more than I love myself
1	He 's an outgoing guy , but as things have progressed , I 've noticed a few things that are putting me on the fence
1	I 'm 26 now and I only committed because I was sure this is legit
1	I am very invested in our relationship although we are very different
1	I 'm conservative , he 's liberal but we meet in the middle in a lot of waysreligiously and culturally
1	Just plain and simple , I want to know if I am going to be making a mistake or not
1	My family is no longer invested in him and they do n't trust him
1	It pains me because although he 's imperfect , I 'm crazy about him
1	He makes promises and breaks them
1	We have been planning to have our wedding since January
1	He was not willing to take any real action to planning a wedding or setting a date because he was committed to funding his relative 's wedding
1	He did that , depleted his savings and now has close to nothing for us to have a wedding and wants to do something incredibly simple at home
1	This is after he got my hopes up , had me look at and visit a venue that was gorgeous
1	The day he was supposed to put the deposit down he made up some   and said we 're not doing it
1	He recently found out he has genital herpes
1	He has a pretty dicey past but he regrets it and I do n't care to know about his youth because he is done with that part of his life and is looking to start a family
1	Granted , when he found out , he tried to break things off with me because he believed I deserved better
1	I did n't let him break up with me
1	Since we have been together , he has been asked to resign from one job and is currently about to be fired from another for lack of performance
1	I respect that and I 'm not a gold digger , but I do n't know that I would feel comfortable being a stay at home momwife as he wants me to be if he is not in the right industry that suits his skills or motivates him
1	If I do n't agree with him about something , he has to do it his way
1	For example , when I told him I feel uncomfortable with him going out with his friend and friend 's wife or gf with him being the third wheel he went out with them anyway and basically completely disregarded what I had to say about it
1	When we 're out , he 's all over me and super attentive but especially if another woman walks by or something
1	Sometimes I feel a little apprehensive about everything although I love him to death
1	I just worry if he is going to keep his promises , provide for me , take care of me , and stay faithful to me
1	I strongly believe divorce is not an option , especially since this is round 2 for meand him
1	I have BPD and i m having relationship issues , I am constantly being told that i have a terrible attitude all the time , And everything my girlfriend does seems to get to me , i seem to be having some control issues ,   example if she s at work and she does nt call me on her break i m tripping out , meanwhile she texts me and that should be good right
1	Then there s the trust issue I trust her but then there s times i feel insecure when i ve never been given the reason not to be trusting example if she s at work and she went to the bathroom and was nt back in a reasonable amount of time that meant she was flirting or wanting to be with someone else i m always in a bad mood and i have even tried taking medicine such as Wellbutrin , effexor ,   some other aintidepressants but nothing seems to work can someone suggest something please i just wanna be able to be good again in my relationship and not let my disorder screw this up we have been together for 3 years and i love her with all of my heart And if your advice is to tell me to stop being controlling and insecure do nt bother in responding to my post i need real advice like activities i can do to stop being this way
1	and i think am depressed , i cried my   off for a whole week 247 this was 3 weeks ago and after that i think i ran out if water to cry with cuz nothing comes out nomore am pretty sure i let all my feelings out that week
1	i have never tried commiting suicide , tho i do think about dieing , i been thinking about it pretty often
1	also i had never cutt my self till now
1	what s moe weird is that one day i just woke up and i did nt want to eat , sleep , see my friends or familyi did nt find amything interesting anymore
1	i remember i used to be so happy and laugh all the time and was so talkative and friendly i remeber when i always had things on my mind
1	but now i hardly even open my mouth in fact i do nt want to talk anymoreand my mind is blank all the time the world and my life just seem soo boring
1	and to top it of my bestfriend replaced me   it was kinda my fault since i stopped beig myself since december and for some reason i was mad that whole month and i was being mean to him so i guess i pushed him away
1	that just makes me sadder because i want by beffo ' back   am so mad at myself for being like thati want to be the person he met , the real me , not the one that i am now
1	i do nt like myself nomore its not cuz i hate my physical appearance cuz am happy with it
1	my personality has changed in such a drastic way so darn fast that i do nt even know how to get it back anymore
1	its like i have gotten used to being boring , sad , and being so alone that i 've sorta forgotten how to be somethinf else , how to be me
1	i do nt want any more marks on my wrists and i do nt want to kill myself
1	Hello , about 2 years ago I started dealing very bad anxietypanic attacks along with depression
1	I honestly have no idea why because growing up I was overall a happy child
1	So I saw my doctor and that 's when she prescribed me Effexor 75MG
1	I felt like my normal self , was n't depressed , did n't barely have any anxietypanic attack , it worked awesome for me
1	This year will be almost 2 years of me being out it but in the past month I have notice myself going back to where I started , but not as serve
1	I am still eating normally , have n't been crying at all , I still go to work and school , all of that
1	But I can feel myself being depressed somedays are better then others my anixeity its getting worse so I saw my doctor about 2 weeks ago and he suggested that I could try bumping up my dosage to 150MG
1	I started doing that about a week ago and that whole week I overall felt betterbut now this week I feel up and down with it
1	I have a hard time understanding why I am like this
1	My dad is bipolar and struggles with depression , but he lived a very bad childhood which seems to be why he is bipolar now
1	I am afraid that I am slowly becoming bipolar
1	Right now I am handling a 10 month old , while working during the week , and on top of going to school in the evenings during the week
1	I do n't knowI just would like someone who can possibly relate to what I am going through and could have some answers
1	thank you and I would greatly appreciate it
1	I had been on Zoloft for 15 years , first on 100 , then 50 for the last 7 years
1	50 mg was n't working as well for me anymore , and I wanted to try to switch my meds anyway to improve my sex life
1	Well , after a rollercoaster of a year where I tried Wellbutrin first , then Nefazodone , then falling into a very deep depression I realized that I really do need to be on Zoloft
1	The other pills did n't really help my drive , but they did make sex more pleasurable and had quickereasier orgasms
1	Now that I am going back , I am devastated to be losing that part of my life again
1	I know that increasing Zoloft will work against the sex issue , but I may need to go higher than 50
1	I also know that you can augment drugs like Wellbutrin I was on this combo for 2 months and I think it could work again
1	Or do I just accept that I have to trade in my sex life for my emotional wellbeing
1	I am so scared that I am doing the wrong thing here
1	I 'll try to make a long story shortMy husband and I are highschool sweathearts , we have been together 30yrs , married 25we have been constantly fighting the past two yrs , it 's never been great , but lately it 's been horrible , we have been in and out of conseling , the past 6mnths we have seriously talked of divorce , and have even been living in seperate bedrooms , but still having ya know , anyway , I thought he was trying to hide part of our savings , and yesterday I called him on it , and I told him I wanted to see all the statements for the last 4mnths , and he went balistic , he told me we had blank amount in there and that was all and I should n't worry about it I should trust him , I told him I wanted his password to see the accts for myself , after an arguement , and him locking himself in his room for an hr with the phone , he came out and calmly said I could have the password , and oh there was really blank in there a few thousand more than he originally told me , but still not what I thought , now my question is and again I made a very long story short , but is he lying about the money ,
1	and if he is , is he hiding it , so I wo n't spend it , or is he hiding it so when he files for divorce he will have a little nest eggplease any advice will be appreciatedCan a person hide money , isn't it tracked by their social security number
1	I had a nervous breakdown a few years ago and have had trouble getting back to normal but this year , a few months ago All my anxiety symptoms changed and now I pretty much only get headachespain and nausea
1	The headaches come in around 46pm nearly every day either the back of my head or foreheadtemples and they slowly move around
1	It ends up around my forehead and eyes and my sinuses change
1	I either get stuffy or really clear And my throat kinda gets tighthard to swallow like nervousness and my saliva tastes different
1	Then at some point I get a weird feeling in my stomach and eventually , the head pain breaks and I go into serious panicanxiety Like I was released from a grip and am in free fall
1	I can typically go to sleep but I wake up most mornings with nausea and anxiety
1	I 've had a CT scan a few months back , blood work etc No issues ever found
1	I was on my way home from work on the train a few days ago and there was two men sitting near me , one was playing his mp3 player on full volume right next to me which caused me to become incredibly angry , I felt like snapping at this guy but I did n't
1	I did n't want to move to another carriage because my stop was coming up , I got off at my stop and the guy who was talking on his phone got off also , I tried sort of pushing past him , I was still fuming at this time I wanted to antagonize him and take out my anger on him
1	He was a big guy , alot bigger than me
1	When I walked past him he pushed me in the back and said I will kill you l had almost reached the stairs to turn off away from him but I turned around and swore at him again calling him horrible swear words loudly , I did n't even feel good when I said it but I could n't control myself , As he was walking past me I pushed him from the side and he dropped his phone and it smashed into pieces , then I ran off
1	Ever since that incident I have had an unbearable feeling of guilt , shame and fear , Guilt and shame that I lost control and acted in such a violent and stupid way in public in front of other people and fear because I get that train route everyday from work and I am dreading seeing him again and if he recognizes me , what he might do
1	I used to fall asleep on the train a lot but I do n't think I can do that anymore
1	I 'm a 15 year old Italian girl
1	During the last few years i 've been seeing a number of psychologists because of my selfdestructing tendencies and overall behaviour
1	I have been selfharming for two years and suicide happens to be one of the most recurrent thoughts for me
1	There are times in which I love myself and times in which I find myself disgusting , I hate people or love them , I change mood constantly , bursting out and screaming at friends or family
1	Then I fall into depression and try to hurt myself in all ways I can cutting , banging , burning , scratching , smoking , snorting pills
1	I know there must be something wrong with my brain
1	I am constantly paranoid about little things , and my moods change radically in no time
1	I 've read both about Bipolar and Borderline Personality disorders
1	My psychologist does n't seem inclined to diagnosing me anytime soon , should I try meeting a psychiatrist
1	I am always anxious and wonder what i 've done wrong and who'se going to spot it
1	I ca nt seem to get little details quite right with my reports no matter how many times i check
1	I think boss is talking about me and being negative he 's been giving out weired vibes we used to get on fine before changes
1	I 've developped a twitch in my left eye for the last several weeks
1	In my adolescence and teen years i used to be very moody
1	I complain about everyone to everyone else except a few people who i absolutely love and never say anything bad about them even if they do something bad support them
1	Still people are drawn to me , those who are difficult with others speak and get on well with me even when I 've not said anything bad about people they do nt like
1	But as luck would have it I do nt get on with people i need to make work life easier
1	Hi , my name is Kelly and In the past few months i have been extremely stressed out
1	I have a lot of things on my mind including huge financial issues , even more huge jobrelated issues unsolvable , sexual intimacy issues , just about everything
1	If i were to write everything down , it looks so simply to fix but when i start writing down ideas and solutions i get too worked up and start crying again
1	I do n't have any appetite eat maybe 1 mealday plus a snackkind of resorting to chocolate bars etc as comfort foods , In the morning i ca n't wake up and at night i ca n't sleep
1	I feel like i m going insane
1	I get a tight feeling in my chest a lot supposedly due to stress
1	and the feeling that my headbody ca n't hold everything in , i litterally feel like i 'm going to burst
1	So , basically , yes i know i m stressed and yes i know i m depressed
1	I know the typical eat better , exercise , have a schedule and stick to it plan , but i ca n't seem to make myself stick to it , or even start it sometimes
1	I need to go to work to get out of my financial debt , but i feel i ca n't go to work because if someone even looks at me the wrong way i feel like i m going to start crying
1	Does n't help my boss continually yells at me for ACTUALLY no reason not being niave
1	I m a waitress , and while i work , i find myself totally monotone
1	I f i do i m pretty sure people can tell its fake
1	Anything at all would help , i feel like i m digging my own hole that s getting very very deep
1	Thank you , Kelly
1	My gf and I have been together 8 years and have a 6 yr old and a 1 yr old
1	After a few years things changed it was n't the same for me anymore
1	Then we were having a child so I manned up and changed my attitude , there were bumps on the road along the way
1	My mind wandered and we almost broke up a few times   bc of me but always came back because of our family
1	I was the provider and she made just enough to cover bills , which is more then a lot of stay at home moms can do
1	We had another child , again not planned but we were both happy
1	After the birth I was supportive and still am , I want what 's best for the kids which is for us to stay as a family
1	I also want what 's best for my gf
1	I love her and I always will but I am not in love with her
1	I fantasize about other women , I tried to discuss what really turns me on intimately but she just is n't the sexual type that I like
1	I have n't asked her to marry me because of this shallow expectation I have
1	I was also afraid to leave because she did n't make much money
1	But now she makes WAY more then I do
1	We were on our way to having the comfortable lifestyle
1	I have just expressed myself to her on how I truly feel after hiding it for years and years
1	It broke her heart and I feel like a piece of
1	She wo n't have any money problems because I 'm there to help as well
1	I know money does n't solve the feelings of rejection I do n't want to live a lie
1	I do n't want her to be treated poorly because of my bad attitude
1	She deserves better , but yet I 'm the one who loses all of our friends
1	Even my family is going to reject me because I am the   who left
1	I do n't know if I 'm being selfish or not
1	I feel blind but my heart yearns for something else
1	If I met someone else it might go south again and then i will regret what I have done
1	We have not gone to a couples councilor , I 'm sure that will be the response from most of you
1	i am 15 and i m suffereing from a disease called puberty i think
1	i m a size 12 , but weel like a size 112 , i m eating way too music , to that s making be hyper , then depressed
1	i m in my last few months of skl i m from england by the way and its getting a bit too mushc for me
1	i hate my image and i want to change , its just aquard asking you parents for PVC gothic clothing that s all
1	as you 've probally guessed , i 'm broken hearted , but what 's worse is that its ben breoken , and broken and broken and broken , by the same person , and now he s basically told me that he never wants me again
1	he been toying with me , flurting , then saying no we should stop
1	at one point he said he loved me , and a few hours later he said oh no we should stopand its come to this
1	yes i self harm , and yes he knows , he said that s y we split up , but there s more to it i knowor it could just be the fact that he s male
1	all i know is that , i m stuck in a cycle , and i m constantly worried that i 'll loose him
1	ppl say you need to get over him and its time you moved on , but i tried that , and i got treated like a piece of and what the hell would they know
1	they do nt know how i feel , i do nt even know if i know how i feel , what i do know is that i m lonley
1	i want to loose my virginity before in 16 , but at this rate , i never will
1	he says i m paranoid , and i do get stressed alot
1	i am frustrated and i believe its sexual
1	what is the quesion i hear you ask
1	i just want someone close to me , and him leaving makes me feel like they ll be no tomorrow without him
1	i love him so much , and he just ca nt see it
1	he says our love faded away , and the tried to make it all work , he thought about it so hard , and he said he would be lieing to himself if we got back together
1	But what he does nt realise is that i knew him for one day when he asked me out , and i have no where near as much love as i do for him now , i just did nt know him that well , but i took the chance and we went out for 3 months
1	i just want him to realise that he s not right all the time
1	you do nt know unless you try
1	he says he does nt like anyone else , but it makes me feel sick when he s even with another girlmaybe i m just going crazybut do you blame me
1	he s cute in his own way , and i m scared that ill loose him
1	he says he wants me to be happy , well there s only one way that will happen , but he does nt want to take the chance
1	i think i scared him away when i mentioned the S word
1	i m willing to die for him
1	he believes that when i m in pain its my fault
1	he left me cause i self harmed and he thought it was his fault , but i just did it more because he dumped mei did it before i knew him
1	but he left me anyway
1	and now i m stuck on my own
1	i do nt have a life with out him
1	but i guess that s how i m destined to be
1	Hello , I am just starting to take some zolfot to see if I can maybe chill out a bit , but I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to relax and get your mind off things
1	If I feel a slight itch in my vagina I think I have herpes
1	I went through a phase where I thought for no reason I had bed bugs , and I stayed up nights watching them , and did n't sleep at all
1	I would obsessively check my skin to see if they had bitten me , and sometimes I would wake up with splotches and think they had bitten me
1	the splotches went away after a few minutes I also freak out and think if someone does n't talk to me for a bit that they 're mad at me
1	I never express these feelings to anyone or call the people obsessively , but I 'll check my phone and feel absolutely heartbroken if they do n't contact me
1	One time I got ringworm from my boyfriend and I thought it was coming back everytime I felt a tingle on my leg
1	I am a sixteen year old girl and I am pretty sure I 've been depressed for approximately two years
1	I 've been feeling hopeless , sad , worthless , numb , I have suffered from insomnia , changes in appetite and suicidal thoughts
1	During this period I have been to two therapies I am not sure how to call therm but they were pretty much weekly meeting with a psychologist without any medication or help from psychiatrist
1	Each lasted a few weeks and ended up after the psychologist advised my parents to take me to a phychiatrist
1	Since I started feeling this way my mother has been extremely unsupportive towards me
1	She actually makes me feel even worse every time I try to talk to her about it
1	For example when a few months ago for the first time I told her that I wanted to die which unfortunately is true up to this day she told me that I am selfobsessed and selfish
1	She literally thinks that I have made up my sadness or that I am doing all of this for attention
1	I have lost hope that she could ever help me
1	She makes me feel that I am not worthy of help or love
1	This month is especially hard for me because I have A LOT of homework and tests due next week
1	And at the same time I feel terrible and I am unable to study
1	At least we have winter holidaywhich end in 3 days and I can spend all days at home
1	My friend advises me to go to the school counselor and I am afraid of doing this
1	Unfortunately , in my city to start any private therapy I need to go to the psychologist with my parents
1	Right now my mother is at work and I started to think about trying to talk to her and asking to take me to a psychologist but I am afraid of her reaction
1	Please tell me what you I should do
1	Thank you for your advice
1	A boy of 24 year age why should he have all these problems
1	His test for urine culture was done one month back which was normal
1	He was given tabs ' augmetin ' for two weeks for pain
1	He was checked by sex doctor for VD diseases who performed physical check of his organs also and inform no problem
1	He was having infection in his semen as per the tests done one year back for which he was given treatment but after that again semen check was not done
1	He was having low semen count also but he is still unmarried
1	He says that his problems have started since his sex encounter in Canada
1	He was also suffering from depression for one year back which reoccurred recently and is taking medicine like Mirtaz 15 mg one dailyand fludac daily 2
1	He says he is not able to go out in the morning cold
1	He says he is getting cold very fast on taking any thing cold like ice cream
1	I 've always battled depression as far as I could remember even early years of childhood
1	I get to a dark place of wishing I would n't wake up the next day or something would just take my life but not necessarily about taking my own life
1	I care too much about my partner and my family to do that
1	I 've been a walking zombie for about 8 months now , just sort of going through the motions of life but feeling numb and isolated , with no interests in anything
1	For the past two and a half months I have n't left my bed or my room
1	I get up and get ready for work or school but I come back home and get right back into my sweats and get in bed
1	If I do n't have a prior engagement , I 'm in bed and some days do n't even get ready or clean myself up
1	I 'm currently on Effexor 377 mg I was on a higher dosage but am being taken off of it because it was n't working for me I have tried many antidepressants but have pretty drastic side effects with all of them
1	I have no drive or energy and I 'm at the point where I ca n't even force myself to do things like go for a walk anymore
1	Hey guys , I 've been under a great deal of stress for the last ten years and have n't had too much trouble coping with it
1	I 've been through so much , but I stay optimistic and focused on the future
1	These last few months I have developed a terrible , terrible stress disorder
1	Anyways , I fought the illness with everything that I had , and guess what
1	I kept a journal every day for how bad my anxiety was and when it happened as well as meditated and used breathing techniques
1	But , in the last 2 weeks or so , as my anxieties are fading away , I 've developed constant heart palpatations , and I generally feel half drunk most of the day
1	Could my stress levels which are still high , though I 'm recovering cause my heart to act so crazy
1	I just do n't get it , and its making this fight with my own demons much harder
1	Also , I 've been getting chest pains that do not accompany my palpitations
1	The chest pain radiates into my left arm and usually lasts about 5 to 10 minutes
1	I have been in a relationship for over 22 years
1	We have 2 children together 16 and 14 and have been married for 18 years
1	I am unhappy and I am assuming he is too
1	He is very passive aggressive and self centred and lashes out at me and kids and makes us feel small
1	But then will turn on a dime and expect us to all be one big happy lovey family and when we do nt warm up to him , he gets sulky and mopey
1	Whenever I try to talk to him about the state of our marriage he rolls his eyes and comments here we go again , I have asked him to go to therapy and he has declined saying things along the lines of are you on glue
1	We also have not been intimate for three months
1	I can go to bed naked and he has no idea
1	I feel guilty for wanting to leave our relationship but am so very unhappy
1	He threatened to hit me in front of our kids and then told them it would be their fault if he had
1	It took months before he would even discus the incident with me and then would not take ownership of it
1	He told me that he could nto be help 100 responsible because he told me to back off
1	I suppose i just need to know that these are good reasons for leaving a relationship of this length
1	I also would like to hear from people who have left relationships where   is an issue he makes over double waht i make and I would nt be able to support myself and kids on my salary , but do nt want to have to depend on him for anything   he can and will be very mean
1	I have anxiety and I have always been extremely insecure
1	I think I believed one day I would just develop it and know I 'm 15 years old and I cry every time I look in the mirror
1	I am certainly ashamed of who I am
1	I would be someone else in a heartbeat if I could
1	I have never really liked someone as much as this boy I knew for 3 years but just started talking to about 2 months ago
1	We talked a lot and I actually thought despite what I looked like , he liked me
1	And he made me really happy
1	Our conversations consisted of everything you could think of
1	I thought I mattered to him more than I did
1	I thought he liked me , But he did n't and I put so much effort in the relationship
1	He even told me I was different from other girls , and he is particularly different from other guys so I thought maybe it could work
1	He made me feel amazing
1	And I know i m kinda young but I only like someone and i ve never done that before
1	I personally believe I have a great personality
1	I am easy to talk to , and I have deep conversations with people
1	I am very kind to everyone , but most people think I am annoying if I care too much and I know for a fact that would be different if I were pretty
1	This person I liked told my other friend that he s tired of me and I do n't know what s wrong with meI just wish I was beautiful
1	And it kills me that its something that I ca nt change , well for now
1	I just do n't picture myself being proud of who I am while looking like this
1	I definitely will get cosmetic surgery , but I do n't know how to be happy right now
1	I cry so often and I ca nt stop
1	I just have n't been happy in so long an I do n't know what to do
1	I have never considered suicide because that is selfish but I just loathe myself and I do n't feel like living anymore
1	I am nearly 27 and my partner is 36
1	We have been together 2 and a half years
1	I met him very shortly after I broke up with a man I was deeply in love with
1	As a result , I have always had one foot out the door , always expecting to leave him
1	I feel extremely anxious whenever I 've tried to leave
1	He makes me cry with laughter , is incredibly charming and clever and when he wants to be , is fantastic
1	I am so drained and exhausted from walking on eggshells all this time , trying to ' get it right ' so that he does n't explode orand judge
1	However , now he is very worried about his health
1	The first lot of blood tests have come back all Ok and hence his Doctor has said that it is not cancer but they still do n't know what is wrong and he is scared
1	Whenever I mentioned that I am not happy together , he brings up how scared he is that he 's dying and how much he needs right now
1	On top of this , I bumped into my ex boyfriend recently
1	I have never cheated on a partner before and feel sick with myself , but at the same time it felt so right to be back with someone who I connected with so deeply
1	I 've never felt that way about my current partner
1	I am so angry at my current partner , but feel so guilty
1	I want to just end the relationship and be away from it all but he is so scared and sounds so lost that I do not know what to do
1	Today , me and my boyfriend were fooling around like we normally do when we 're alone , we 've been together for almost ten months and never had sex
1	We 've done oral but that s the furthest we 've gone
1	Whilst fooling around today , it got to a stage that s never happened before   i was on my front , him behind me , and his uncovered penis inbetween my cheeks
1	He did nt go in , but neither of us wore any underwear , and he did nt wear a condom
1	Whilst he was just moving , he slipped down , but his penis never went in
1	I do n't remember where the tip was though , it could have been past or just covering my vagina
1	He did nt ejaculate , however he had done previously , but gone to pee afterwards
1	After we did that , i went into the bathroom , peed as well , then wiped my area clean with both tissue and a wet cloth
1	My last period ended two days ago
1	Is it worth going to the pharmacy tomorrow and asking for the morning after pill when I 'm underage in the uk
1	Please help because both me and my boyfriend are becoming paranoid
1	Is it normal for a 14 year old boy to stay home every weekend , his school friends go to movies , bowling etche just stays home plays his video games looks at youtube and watches TV
1	He has Facebook and myspace accounts that he hardly gets on because he says they are stupid
1	He get straight A 's   behaves like a nerd but thinks he is in the normal crowd
1	I hate labeling him but I do n't know how else to explain it
1	My wife and I are on the verge of divorce because of it
1	She thinks he is fine and normal
1	We do n't go to church , he does n't play any sports so he does n't have any kind of social outlets outside of school
1	He wants to go to college but I think if this continue he will just want to stay home and play games all day
1	He played soccer for 6 years adn now he just says he hates it
1	My wife feels that it 's normal to be home every weekend at 14
1	Am I pushing too hard for him to be with his friends or should I just let him be
1	It 's to the point that every weekend it 's a battle of me trying to encourage him to go out and my wife and I end up in an arguement
1	She has never pushed him to try harder , do better or be more asserative at anything , I have and I end up being the jerk because of it
1	Now my younger 11 year old son is forming the same social habbits
1	I do n't want to divorce my wife but I ca n't stand by and do nothing
1	My family is making me so angry , I just had to write about it
1	I am trying my best to practice not getting angry , because I do have a very bad temper , but they are really pushing my buttons today
1	I spent the weekend with a major migraine , and now it is slowly creeping back from all the commotion ,
1	My daughter wrote a very cutting remark about me posting messages to people she went to school with on FB
1	The thing is they write to me
1	I have known most of them since Public School , when I used to teach remedial reading , so they like to add me as a friend
1	In her mind I am too old to be chatting with people her agedoes that mean I should nt talk to her anymore , especially after the names she called me
1	Then my husband tells me he does nt trust me with the mailbox key   can you imagine
1	What he is waiting for is a chq for me for my disability
1	I agree I owe him , as he has been supporting me for a year now , but in his mind he has been supporting me forever , so yes , he is entitled to some of the money , but he wants to use it to buy a flat screen TV
1	I think that is not utilizing the money properly , we still owe friends and family
1	Then he accused me of stealing cigarettes , which I did nt
1	I woke up last night , opened a pack because I was running low , and I put half in his pack and half in mind , but he says I did nt
1	So I did nt wake up , I did nt open a pack of smokes it was all in my head   NOT
1	I really do nt like when someone tells me what I am thinking or how I feel , only I know that , otherwise it is just an assumption
1	And as for my daughterI do nt want to talk to her for a while , she keeps on saying things like whatever your so called bipolar makes you do , she does nt even think I have bipolar , my husband told her on the weekend that at the very minimum I have it , so being a daddy 's girl , she accepted it , but is now using it against me
1	The real fact is that my main illness is Schizoaffective Disorder w BiPolar 1 and other issues such as anger , depression , OCD , PTSD etcbut she does nt believe in any of that
1	I have been trying very hard to avoid confrontations , so I say nothing , or leave the room , but inside I am just ready to burst , and if you have an anger problem , you know how it is , you let things build up until you explode , then you are exhausted and usually regretting things you saidbut they are getting close to pushing the wrong button
1	So with a divorce in place , and were about 4 months from the divorce being finalized , my husband has been holding the divorce over my head , and says if he sees changes in me and our relationship , he might stop the divorce and we can be together again
1	He has been so nasty and mean to me since he filed for divorce
1	We do n't have any contact and he stopped wearing his ring and started buying new clothes , I suspect that their is somebody else
1	I told him this week in counseling that I 'm done , I 'm walking away
1	I 'm not doing things his way anymore
1	He had the nerve to tell me that I 'm giving up on our marriage and I 'm emotionally abondoning our relationship
1	He 's the one that filed for divorce and moved out , but it 's my fault when I wo n't work on our relationship while a divorce is in place , but according to him , it 's my fault
1	And earlier this week , he took off his ring but I noticed when we were sitting in marriage counseling , it was back on his finger again
1	This is a game to him , he wants to put the blame on me and he wants to make him self look good
1	Oh yeah , and he tried to bail out of counseling this week , and when I told him that I was still going to meet with the counselor , he was like oh , let me see what I can do , and he texted me later and said , good news , I will be at counseling
1	He wants to paint this picture that he 's trying to save the marriage , and everything is for show

1	I met my current boyfriend 5 years ago
1	We were friends first and he told me a lot about his current girlfriends , At the time it did n't bother me at all because I was also doing my own thing
1	We started dating and were always best friends but after I got pregnant things changed
1	I gained 100 pounds with my pregnancy and it made me feel even worse
1	I have always had depression issues since as long as I can remember
1	I have always hated the way that I looked , I lost 85 pounds from the pregnancy
1	I still hate myself and have always dieted since I was 11
1	My son is now 18 months and when I am with him I feel fine and just about my son
1	When I am around my fiancé wherever we are I hate myself to the extreme
1	I want to drink and cry about how I look
1	Everyone my whole life has told me I was pretty but I ca n't believe it My fiancé is loved by my family and always used to reassure me but its changed
1	I sincerely am lost , I have seen a counselor and talked about this
1	She has told me it is n't reality and I need to realize what that is but to me the fact that I 'm disgusting is reality
1	The hate for myself is overwhelming , I have attempted suicide before my son 2 times
1	My son is the drive for me going to college and not taking that step but I 'm lost
1	Hello , I 've been depressed for a while now and I have already felt depersonalizationderealization before , but it usually only lasts for a day or two at a time or when my anxiety is real bad
1	Lately for the past week I have n't felt like a real person
1	I 'll get consistent negative thoughts at night that make it difficult for me to sleep too
1	They 're always about things I very much regret from the past and just stupid things I 've done in general
1	It 's difficult for me to even look my family in the eyes from the time I wake up
1	I feel guilty , like they do n't like me because of the stupid things I 've done in the past that they never approved of and so on
1	It 's difficult for me to even choose what to wear or what music to listen to at the time , because I do n't feel like myself and do n't choose what I normally would
1	I feel like just a body between crowds when I go out
1	I do n't even like talking or thinking sometimes because I do n't even feel human

1	I was diagnosed hypothyroid in May 2013 with no family history of thyroid illness
1	I have been finding it very hard to cope with things   I left my job in November 2012 because I felt so poorly and my manager did not let me go to the doctors to get my health sorted
1	I feel that had I have been diagnosed and treated sooner I would never have left
1	My family do not understand my illness and my boyfriend just nags me to take my medication
1	Anyway things with my mental health are just so weird and I do n't know where to begin
1	My doctors are convinced what I have is psychological
1	None of my family know about the problems I have been having as I have been stigmatized in the past by my grandparents as being a nut job who should be locked away in a mental home
1	My grandfather told me that to my face
1	I used to like drawing in my spare time and write stories which were popular online but due to feeling very low I have not had as much motivation or inspiration as I used to
1	My doctor has put me on an SSRI , Citalopram , but I have n't noticed any difference at all
1	I have been on it since the middle of February
1	I currently see a counselor and he has been helping me lots as he works alongside my thyroid support consultant
1	Derealization   I can spend a lot of time simply staring into space and before I know it , half an hour goes by
1	I can recall one I had involving my thyroid support consultant and myself
1	She is asking me why I left the thyroid support forum not on this site and when I told her the reason why she then told me that I never lost their support   if anything they have lost me and want me to come back
1	I left the support forum in March due to a misunderstanding and I have never returned
1	I have n't even spoken to my thyroid support consultant for over a month because I feel so bad about what had happened
1	I still have questions I need answering but due to what had happened I have not shown my face to the thyroid support forum or any of my fellow sufferers
1	Gosh I do feel crazy writing this Selfneglect   I have been advised by a nutritionist to adopt a healthier diet plan but this nutritionist I consulted dispensed advice to me that a member on the thyroid support forum did not approve of due to the more holistic approach
1	I created a post which told everyone that I wanted to do things my way and that anyone who disapproved of my decision should just keep their opinions to themselves as I found it upsetting to be criticised in following an alternative approach
1	Unfortunately I upset someone who was helping me lots and they now hate me
1	Now I have lost this support and left that forum I have gone back to my old habits of eating junk food , missing my supplements and have become very nonchalant about how I look and feel
1	I did n't even go to the most recent thyroid support meeting even though I had questions I wanted answering
1	Mood swings   I do act up in such bizarre ways and I always have done
1	I sign myself up to dating agencies online and start relationships with other men   I was assaulted at 15 years old and have been in a lot of relationships that had no emotional involvement whatsoever , just physical
1	The boys picked on me because I was ugly , the girls picked on me because I was quiet and had few friends
1	Because of my illness I see an endocrinologist but they have been moving my next appointment further and further away
1	I feel as though I am never going to get the answers I need and my original appointment was booked for April
1	I now have to wait until the end of May
1	This may sound all really farfetched and hard to believe and I do n't mind if there is anyone on here who thinks I am being stupid or nasty
1	I am not breaking down , in fact I am trying very hard to keep myself together but at times I feel as though that in itself is so hard to do
1	hi to u all my friend phoned me yesterday and asked me could she come round she needed to talk so round she came in a state right from she was a child she watched her father hurt her mother this was physcial and emotional abuse from as far back as she could remember and her brother sexually touched her her brother is 18 months younger than her but she says it has really not bothered her as she thinks he was young and did nt understand this brother she just found out a few years ago did the same to her younger sister but she meet her childhood sweetheart when she was 15 and he new what she was going through so she thought he would help her and she left home to be with him and by the time she was 17 she had her first baby she now has 2 children but her partner who she has been with has beat her bad for years staples in her head and has stabed her 3 times this is not counting the black eyes or the brusies all over her body he has raped her twice so he has sexually abused her as well as the the physcial and emotional abuse but this has been a period of 12 years she said its all not bad she has no support from family and if she leaves she has no money or job as they bought a small business and she put all her own money that she worked for into but her name is not on nothing i ca nt help her as i live in a small place with my own 2 children i told her there is womens refuges and other places she can go but she says she do nt want to put her kids through them places i said do nt put ur self or your kids through this hurtful mess with him i think she just needed someone to talk to without being juged i do nt no what to do this is why i m asking for some advice thanks for reading
1	Well , I have been clean now for almost 5 weeks
1	I mean , this is something I keep track of in my head , and when I realize how well I m doing , it makes me feel better
1	Like I 'll keep saying to myself ok , its 4 weeks now , ok its 5 weeks now
1	And the reason I want to do this is because without lusting so much it gives me a clearer head , and I m able to just live better
1	But today I 've been having some fears
1	Like I m sometimes afraid of my commitment to my fiance , in which we 're getting married in 2 months , and I do nt want anything wrong to happen
1	But I know how awesome she is
1	I do love her
1	I guess I just miss her
1	But I think of other girls alot , it sometimes calms me
1	I used to think I was Bisexual but I realized it was just from so much lusting that I thought this way
1	Now I do nt do it anymore , I feel more innocent I feel more free
1	But at the same time I have so much belief that we should be together forever
1	She 's awesome , I love her with all my heart
1	I am feeling so stressed due to what has happened the last 3 years
1	I will try to sum this up ad hope someone can give me some words of encouragement
1	About 3 years ago I was stuck with a needle artwork and subsequently acquired Hep C and HIV
1	Then just about 2 months after being diagnosed I developed viral encephalitis , and a very bad case of shingles
1	I was unable to walk due to the nerve damage to my spine from some virus attacking my spine
1	Have to wait for a new drug to come out for a treatment for the Hep C I had minimal use of my leg and worked very hard at physical therapy to the point I am now able to walk short distance with just a cane
1	I had to stop work and due to memory problems and my inconsistent ability to remember things i will most likely not return to work
1	My current issue is I know the Bible says to give thanks in all circumstances
1	When in the hospital I had 5 days of no memory of what happened
1	I know of support groups but my husband does not want me to attend
1	He feels I should have enough support between him and my family that i should not have to go to a HIV support group
1	I do not feel really depressed although it has taken very little for me to start crying
1	I resent having to take meeds al the time and I hate the fear of not knowing if the meeds will work forever
1	I am very lucky to have a husband and family that doews care and tries to give me all the support I need
1	Me and my husband were really really tooo happy We love each other a lot he cared me lot   We were separate from our in laws day by day my mother in law was jealous about us and started telling him bad about me but he never listed to her
1	But one day she fighted with me twisted my finger my finger got fracture And sent me to my parents My husband was with her for 1 week
1	I called him so many times he did n't replied in between this it was our first anniversary I tried to contact him but he did n't replied my parents called to his dad but they did n't made him to talk with me   One day I got call from him n he was crying telling that he ca n't leave without him his mom is holding him   After all this one day me n my family directly went to der home All of them beat us and throwed out but my hubby was not der
1	They locked him in d room
1	But their parents buyed police station SI we did not get justice   Again went to other police station and booked a case on his family After this we had councling
1	In councling I heard shocking words from my husband
1	Spoke bad about my character   And now he is telling he do n't want me
1	But I ca n't leave without him
1	I loved him tooo bad even he love me but I do n't know what happened suddenly now he forgot our love promise v made to each other
1	I m not getting what to do plz suggest me
1	I want my husband back
1	I 'm nearly 16 years old and i think I 'm depressed
1	It started over a year ago when me and my mother were having problems , we were always arguing and yelling there was never a day where I would n't cry , this continued on till early his year where it only got worse , I was getting kicked out of home running away , I would spend most weekends drinking or smoking because I could n't be sober because it felt like my thoughts would destroy me , not only problems with my mum I started to argue with everyone in my family they would shame me out on public media , it got to the point I blocked them all because I just could n't read what they had to say , I lost motivation to go to school so I stopped going I completely went down hill , I quit my job
1	Every single day I feel like there is no reason for my existence , I feel as if I 'm no good to this world and I 'm constinly crying and contemplating death , I have never fully attempted but I have writing a suicide note but ended up talking myself out of it , I keep holding on thinking things will get better but they have n't , I still sad every second of the day , I 'm not completely myself anymore , I miss what it feels likes to be actually happy
1	I am way to scared to tell anyone because I do n't want people to think I 'm seeking attention , I really do n't want any one sympathy I have even made up a fake name on here I want to remain as anonymous as possible I am embarrassed to tell anyone I feel like my mum is going to turn around and tell me that I 'm over exaggerating , I feel like she does n't care
1	She has seen my scars and she just tells me to stop doing it , she never ask if I 'm okay or try 's to get me help and it makes me feel like more   that no one cares if I 'm alive or dead
1	I just want to know what I can do I 'm so over feeling so worthless and sad I miss being happy I wanna change my life back to how it was
1	My mother and I have a horrible relationship and it seemed to have started when I entered my freshman year of high school
1	Currently I am a graduating high school senior and I have gotten into a prestigious university , found a summer job and am saving up to help pay for college
1	From my freshman year my mother has constantly verbally assaulted me and I feel like human trash
1	It seems as if I am not good enough for her and everything I do is terrible
1	I am a good kid maintain a decent GPA , have good SAT scores and test well with AP 's , I study hard and I try to help around the house
1	Every time I receive a bad grade my mother will yell and scream but anytime I receive a good grade , B or higher she has not acknowledged it at all
1	Since school is winding down each teacher of mine is also letting loose and not giving us much work but my mother expects me to constantly study even though I really have nothing to study for
1	A few months ago I began a relationship with a boy that I 've know for quite a while before , my boyfriend is kind , funny , sweet and he sincerely cares about me
1	But my mother can not stand him and this is straining my relationship with her even more
1	She use to say that I can come to her about anything but when I approached her about receiving birth control she got very angry with me and basically told me I am a disgusting human being
1	I googled countless of articles trying to prove to myself that all these sexual feelings are normal and it seems that according to reliable organization they are but I ca n't help but feel gross about my thoughts and feelings
1	She also reads every single one of my emails , text messages and facebook conversations and I think that this is overstepping boundaries but she does not agree and reads private messages between my friends and me and my boyfriend and me
1	She ignores me every time I try to talk to her about being reasonable and letting me go out with my boyfriend but she says I should be studying studying studying
1	I have no idea how to approach her anymore , every time I come home even if I 'm in fantastic mood , her presence and her attitude towards me makes me very sour
1	All of this is straining my relationship with my father and my brother and I 'm at a complete loss on what to do
1	I have concerns about my sisterinlaw and her current mental state , but I ’m not sure if they are valid mental health issues and if so what to do
1	She has two children 6 and 3 and refuses to feed them anything other than take out food , mac and cheese , cereal and crackers
1	She claims this is the only food they will eat , but recently she was going to feed the youngest a bowl of cereal for supper and I begin to fix a plate of nutritious food for the child and she uncharacteristically became angry snapping at me and refused to let the child eat anything but dry cereal
1	She claims her children are sick with fevers , vomiting , colds , ear infections and sore throats constantly
1	She insists they are sick even when I can see for myself or others can see there is nothing wrong with the children
1	She takes the children to the emergency room over two times a month , plus she will take them for doctor ’s appointments claiming they are ill She also claims to be ill when there is no supporting evidence
1	She claimed to have two blood clots in her lungs during the summer and was in the hospital for a week , but there was not medical evidence what was physically wrong with her
1	She has a large amount of over the counter medication and prescription medication in her home
1	Also , during the summer she stayed with me and brought a large freezer bag full of medication , but would n’t tell me what it was
1	My mother has confronted her about medicating the children and herself but she denies administering the medication Tylenol so the kids sleep even if my mom just saw her give it to the kids an hour before
1	She sleeps most of the day and the youngest runs wild while she sleeps
1	Her mom cleans her house when she has the energy to , but it becomes disgusting again in a matter of days
1	Last summer my son took out 26 black bags of garbage that were piled up in the back porch
1	She does n’t care about her appearance and eats high fat food she has gain a tremendous amount of weight in the past year
1	She started smoking and lies about doing so even if you mention the yellow marks on her fingers , or that she smells like smoke
1	She basically refuses to work and lies to get out of going by claiming she sick or the kids are
1	She works in a hospital as a LPN
1	She spends money excessively on food and useless thing then lies to her husband about spending the money
1	She shops when ever she can even if they ca n’t afford it
1	She lies all the time about things that are completely untrue , saying her husband sexually abuses her , that her parents abused her , that her sister verbally abuses her
1	She tells anyone that listens to her these horrible stories that are completely fabricated
1	She does n’t care how much these lies hurt others and there is no reason for her to say these things
1	We know that she takes paxil , but we do n’t know what else she takes
1	Hi , I 've been on antidepressants since age 17 am female , now age 49
1	I 'm a lifer I guess   can not imagine not being on an antidepressant
1	Until one month ago , I had been taking 60 mg Cymbalta and 50 mg Trazodone for sleep
1	Problem is , for the last three years in a row , I have had summertime depression
1	Nothing bad has ever happened to me in the summer , so there is no obvious trigger for this depression
1	Usually it hits in midJune , but it did n't this year , so by July I thought , wow   maybe I 've gotten a reprieve this summer
1	I saw a psychiatrist exactly 4 weeks ago , was taken off the Cymbalta and put on Fetzima
1	I now take 75 mg of Trazodone for sleep
1	So , I have been on Fetzima for 4 weeks now , 2 weeks at 40 mg and 2 weeks at 80 mg
1	I just saw my psychiatrist again 1 week ago exactly , where it was decided that I would stay on the Fetzima , even though I was pretty much worse than when I was on the Cymbalta
1	As soon as I left her office , I was thinking why did I agree to that
1	I immediately wanted a do over appointment , because I realized I had spent too much time talking about my symptoms and not enough time talking about medication
1	I already ca n't stand myself , and my job and home life are suffering pretty badly , so if this drug does n't kick in soon , where the heck will I be in 3 weeks
1	After agonizing all weekend about calling the psych back but still continuing to take the Fetzima as prescribed , I managed to muster up the motivation to make the call about 4 pm this past Monday
1	At this point , I had been on Fetzima for 35 weeks
1	I explain to the receptionist that I 'm sorry , I feel worse than I did 4 weeks ago , and I just do n't think this is the drug for me
1	She says okay , well the doctor will respond but it may not be until Wednesday , which I think is a little weird , but I was so relieved to have simply made the call , that I did n't care
1	Sure enough , 48 hours later , I have a message on my phone from her assistant
1	The doctor wants me to continue with the Fetzima because that was what we had agreed to in our meeting 4 days prior
1	If need be , we could discuss any medicine changes when I saw her again at my previously scheduled appointment in 15 days
1	My first thought was no , I do n't have any more questions , because I 've just been dismissed , and I guess she has decided to practice some tough love on me , by insisting that I stay on this medicine , because she does n't think I 've given it a fair chance
1	I feel that the message to me is that I should n't really have a say in whether or not I stay on it , since I 'm depressed and depressed people are notorious for not being able to make a decision or stick to one after it 's made , so she will just make it for me since that is in my best interests , in her opinion
1	Am I right to feel as angry and hurt as I do right now , or is this just my depression talking
1	Do I need to understand that my psychiatrist sees LOTS of depressed people so it 's understandable that she sees me as nothing but another face in the crowd
1	I have made 2 calls to crisis hotlines in the last couple of weeks , and my psychiatrist knows this
1	I 'd never done that before in my entire life
1	I actually googled whether or not I could make the call even if I was n't about to harm myself and I am NOT going to harm myself
1	I go to work during the day , where I try to work AND keep my depression hidden from everyone around me , and then call crisis hotlines at night
1	I am 55 years old and I have had three children
1	I have gone for a pap test yearly since I was 19 and even had a cone biopsy and dc three years ago due to spotting , but this can back clear
1	So I am scheduled now for a hysterectomy as the Gyn stated I am 55 and I do not need to have these organs any longer
1	He said he is doing this as a preventive against me developing cancer later
1	My question is thisit is just possible that my lining is just thick due to the fact that I am not releasing eggs monthly and the lining is just sitting there waiting for this
1	My stepdaughter was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder a couple of months ago after she ran away
1	She was missing for just a short time and had cut herself on purpose while she was missing
1	She had been caught smoking by her stepfather at her mothers house and was unhappy with all of her parents so decided to leave
1	She just did n't have enough forethought to plan where to go , so she was thankfully found and returned home
1	She was diagnosed with BPD and is taking an antidepressant and a lowdose mood stabilizer to help with it
1	She also very irregularly sees a counselor , about once every two weeks
1	Her dad has primary custody and she sees her mom every other weekend and once a week
1	Through our research into BPD , we are almost positive that her mom is undiagnosed BPD to a very extreme degree
1	My stepdaughter hits all the criteria to a less extent , her mom hits all the criteria to a major extent
1	So , here 's the problem My stepdaughter continues to sneak smoking , we learned recently she 's starting to snitch alcohol we lock it up in our house , she lies , and has some very destructive , but typical BPD behaviors
1	We ca n't make any progress , in fact it seems to be getting worse , because what ever we do here to help her , is counteracted MASSIVELY over at her mothers house
1	To the point where she came home tonight and said the only place where she is happy is at her mom 's where she is pretty much free to do what she pleases and we are making her miserable
1	For example We tell her not to hang out with a certain kid , that kid is a VIP at mom 's house
1	She gets a consequence at our house for smoking , she has to talk to her mom about it , and that 's it
1	I have posted questions on BPD   Relationship Forums and people asked me to share my problems
1	This is one of the major problems of my life , the reason I ca n't bring close friends at home , I ca n't bring guest , the reason why I am being called back home 10 min
1	I live in Asia where people suffer acute financial problems
1	I have an autistic bro of 14 and it 's like I was born to witness mental patients and their sufferings
1	My uncle on my mom 's side is a Schizophrenic
1	I used to see him get violent
1	I used to see my other uncles beat him up not knowing the consequences
1	When I was 4 my bro was born
1	It was fun to have him but when he was 2 and a half he was diagnosed with Autism
1	We could train him about some basic behaves but he ca n't talk , he 's not properly toilet trained
1	My mother developed Paranoia 8 years ago but at that time we did not really notice anything serious
1	She was suspcious of my father and that caused a lot of controversy in our conservative family
1	5 years earlier she was diagonised and after a violent outbreak she was hospitalised forcibly
1	The hardest part is , we ca n't get her to visit psychiatrist
1	I am wondering if my mother is abusive
1	She calls me stupid , dumb , and says things like , If you were smart , you would n't She says , I am not sh
1	She constantly nags about what 's is wrong in the house when I am there , among other things that I will refrain from saying
1	I 27 yers oldI can remember her saying very mean things to me when I was a preteen this is when it started
1	I did write about it a lot in my diary , but I thought it was just I 'll personailities conflicted
1	In addition , I am currently in an emotionally abusive relationship with my child 's father and I have been doing research on emotional abuse because of this
1	I figured that it usually comes from romantic relationships , but thinking back , I remember how hurt I was when my mother used to call me names and yell extremely loud at me
1	I know that I am not a saint , but this has affected my social relationships
1	I feel very isolated from my peers
1	I do nt know if I 'm being overly emotional or is mother really emotionally abusive
1	I have read what all of you have written , so many people , so much the same affects
1	I feel worse with this withdrawal then sometimes with my depression
1	I tried what all of you have written about the Bcomplex , Omega 3 's , drinking water , very slow process , but I keep doing it , hoping for relief
1	My own job I could lose , due to my own problems dealing with people
1	This has nothing to do with my withdrawal , but it does n't help the stress I have trying to hold myself together as I go to work
1	In today 's world with stress and worries we just need the patience and practice
1	Bottom line is things will get better , they always do , and you wonder how we made it
1	I was 12 when I had my first period beginning of 2016 And after my first one , I ended up missing my period for five months after the first one , and after my second one came , which was 2 months ago I 've already missed 2 months , I have gained a little bit of weight , and I 've read that a gain and loss in weight can cause a irregular period
1	My number one fear is getting pregnant at a young age , like for example 13 like I am right now I am still a virgin , and I do take baths often , and i 've also read that water can sometimes rarely for some reason have sperm in it , if its not clean
1	and i do nt really understand how i could get pregnant from it
1	I have really bad anxiety when I am late on my period and i always think the worst situation Like , i 'll think i got pregnant I have still missed my second period and its been 2 months , if you know what s going on please help
1	My legs and lower back keep jerking when I try to fall asleep
1	Sometimes it happens in my arms too , but mostly my legs
1	During the day my knees and thighs feel stiff and sore and when I walk I sometimes get cramps in my calves
1	Sometimes I notice a little jerk in my knees when they are bent like when I 'm sitting in a chair , or if I 'm putting pressure on my leg like sitting with my elbow resting on my thigh
1	For a month I was just exhausted and stressed and everything felt sore , it was a miserable month
1	While I have finally started sleeping better thankfully , I still keep getting these contractions in my legs when I 'm about to drift off to sleep
1	I have never had any health problems , sometimes my lower back and neck hurtget occasional headaches but not much else but I have had a very stressful few months
1	I have tried taking magnesium supplements , eating more bananas , getting more exercise , stretching , but I have no idea if anything is helping
1	I really wish I could get to the bottom of this
1	She will do whatever is on her power to subdue them to a role of complete submission to her
1	Once they are under her domain , she humuliates them to the extreme
1	I hate my father for never standing up to her
1	I HAVE NEVER , EVER SUBMITTED TO HER
1	Rarely has she been uble to control me
1	I then slip into a defence mode and before I know , I am at war with them for no other reason than STANDUP to them for attempting to excersise control over me
1	I all reflects back on my mother controlling all the men in her life
1	I lost many jobs for refusing to submit to them
1	While I do realize that not all women are controling , I perceive them all as a threat , and am never able to trust or lower my guard to any of them , with very few exception
1	I deal with the problem by avoiding them altogether including sex
1	Stay away and avoiding them has been my tactics until now , but is seems so shallow to me that I do not have a better tool to overcome this problem
1	Hello , I am 20 years old and I am in college , I started taking Yasmin birth control about 6 months ago
1	I have never been an overlyemotional or person nor have I ever dealt with depression
1	Depression does n't run in my family either , overall I am a pretty happygolucky girl
1	However , when I started taking Yasmin I noticed I would get extra emotional usually around my period , or I would get angry and snap for no reason
1	I have never been on birthcontrol before , until I was 19 and I always had regular periods , and hardly any cramps
1	I started taking Yasmin because I would kinda break out around my period and I thought that would clear it up
1	Now my face breaks out all the time , and that adds to my depression and feeling bad about myself
1	This past week was the worst , I started my period and got so emotional I started crying while I was driving down the highway , for no reason
1	I had 2 panic attacks never had one before and I kept having thoughts I was going to die
1	I would never commit suicide , but I am always feeling anxious
1	I do not want to sound crazy because I m not but , do you know how painful it is to feel like you can not control your own emotions
1	I am a healthy 20 year old and I just had the realization that since I take no other medication the birth control had to be the cause of my depression and anxiety
1	Not to mention my vagina has felt so dry that it almost burns to pee , and I can not wear a tampon
1	When I have sex with my boyfriend , I want to enjoy it but I ca n't because it is so dry , I am willing to trade having my sex life back over a lighter period , not to mention the constant yeast infections
1	Last December I forgot to take my pill , I also thought I was pregnant
1	But i felt great , I was happy and the feelings I had seemed to be gone
1	I started my period so I was n't pregnant but I definetly had all the symptoms of pregnancy , other than a positive pt
1	So then I went back on the pill and that s when the rollercoaster of emotion began again , not to mention i was a little disapointed about not being pregnant
1	I went to the doctor yesterday and she told me that the pill is what is causing me to feel this way , and she gave me some anxiety medicine until I start to feel a little better
1	She also told me to stop the Yasmin
1	I guess what I want to know is , has anyone else experienced this
1	Hey guys , I 've been under a great deal of stress for the last ten years and have n't had too much trouble coping with it
1	I 've been through so much , but I stay optimistic and focused on the future
1	These last few months I have developed a terrible , terrible stress disorder
1	Anyways , I fought the illness with everything that I had , and guess what
1	I kept a journal every day for how bad my anxiety was and when it happened as well as meditated and used breathing techniques
1	But , in the last 2 weeks or so , as my anxieties are fading away , I 've developed constant heart palpatations , and I generally feel half drunk most of the day
1	Could my stress levels which are still high , though I 'm recovering cause my heart to act so crazy
1	I just do n't get it , and its making this fight with my own demons much harder
1	Also , I 've been getting chest pains that do not accompany my palpitations
1	The chest pain radiates into my left arm and usually lasts about 5 to 10 minutes
1	I had a great psychiatrist for years til 2014 when he closed his practice
1	Since then I had one doc who was purely giving me prescriptions after prescriptions for my bipolar II
1	None of them were psychiatric drugs and I was getting severely depressed and am getting worse
1	I had found one doc and thought she would be great for me but on the second visit she seemed very frustrated with me , hardly did not make any eye contact with me and told me that I was a hard patient because the drugs on the market do n't seem to work for me
1	She got up twice from her desk and banged her hands on her desk and said , Do you know how hard it is to be a psychiatrist
1	She kept asking me why I was taking Depakote and Klonopin and that I should ask my prior doc why I was on them
1	She told me that she did n't know what to do with me
1	I stayed quiet and let her rant and she then handed me a script and said , I 'll see you in 2 weeks
1	I left and vowed never to come back to her
1	I have more anxiety than ever and my depression is worse than ever
1	However , I am worried the depression part is not being adequately treated or maybe I have another disorder
1	Ever since my 20s , I have become more detached and socially distant
1	Very few close friends , and I have gone weeks if not longer without contact with them and felt okay about this
1	My family are alright people , but my mother is the only one I have regular contact with
1	I am not married and childless , and I prefer this
1	Sorry for the tangent hereI do sometimes feel attracted to others , but seldom date because they are either unavailable in some way , or I am simply too caught up in the fantasy world to care
1	As stated earlier , I honestly do not believe I had an experience in my past that caused this
1	I also doubt I have Schizoid PD because a alot of interests b I think I react normally to praise and criticism c I am pretty expressive about my emotions
1	Maybe I need my psych to increase this
1	I 've had this feeling happen in almost every relationship I 've had since I was 16
1	I 'm 23 now
1	About once every few months , I get into a mood of emotional disconnect , and it upsets me
1	Currently , I have been with my boyfriend for about four months , and have noticed this emotional disconnect happen a few times since
1	During , I 'm not willing to open up about my feelings , I do n't feel close to him , I ca n't accept his love and I do n't want to even see him
1	If he looks at me kindly it makes my stomach sick and if he does something sweet for me it makes me feel guilty that I 'm using him
1	This only worries me because it has resulted in my feeling emotionally disconnected more and more often the longer I am with someone , and has ended up in termination
1	I know I care about him , the feeling just goes away for a few days
1	I do n't want this to ruin my relationship I have with him , because he is very important to me
1	I experience these feelings with friends , but it does n't bother me as much because the emotional attachment is n't as intimate
1	I know that my issue with intimacy may stem from my relationship with my mother , who was emotionally and physically abusive for the 17 years that I lived with her
1	I do n't know if I 'm depressed occasionally
1	, bipolar I think my mother expressed symptoms of bipolar disorder but refuses to be diagnosed or have PTSD
1	I have taken a few steps to determine my mental health but I mostly do n't know where to start
1	I 've tried counselors , but it 's become emotionally exhausted to explain my position to a counselor I do n't connect with well
1	The one I found is for mental illness , so I 'm not sure if I fit
1	Have you felt this emotional numbness before and how did you address the issue and solve it
1	I 'm getting a little overwhelmed here because I do not want this relationship to end like the others have
1	2 years ago I moved back to Virginia from Florida
1	I ran into my ex husband
1	We split updivorced because he had an affair and was doing illegal drugs
1	I left even though I loved him because I felt it was the right thing to do at the time
1	When I ran into him , I could feel all the old feelings resurfacing
1	Like I mention , I loved him , I was extremely attracted to him
1	He wanted to talk to me , call or text , and I thought really carefully about this
1	Debating on whether I should get involved with him again
1	I chose to talk to him on the phone
1	I found out that he had stopped using drugs , had started his own business , which he had been running sucessfully for the past 6 years
1	We talked about our past , and the mistakes both he and I had made , and Decided to try again and see where it took us
1	He told me he was single
1	But by the time I found out he was seeing someone and had been for the past 6 years I felt that I was already involved
1	He then put me through a roller coaster of things
1	He went back and forth between her and I for months
1	I would tell him that I was done and through with it all only to have him call or come over and tell me he loved me
1	  I know that this was the time when I should have said good bye to him and moved on , But I hoped in my heart that it was true He eventually ended his relationship with this woman
1	He said he had suspected her of cheating and had found out that it was true
1	He said they had been arguing before I showed up , and had already broken up , but that they were still arguing with each other
1	I am used to a pattern or set of guidelines I think most people follow , for example , you do things together , you might go to the beach or plan a date
1	Instead if I went to his house with out calling I would be told to go away
1	But he would come to my house with out calling
1	One week he was totally in love , the next week he was blaming me for comments or experiences that happened 8 or 9 years ago
1	He would have me so upset I just wanted it over , but then he would call and say that he was sorry
1	IF I asked him why he said or did something he would say he did nt remember saying it
1	WHen he would come over he would stay for twenty min or so , then leave
1	He would go through periods of extreme anxiety , where he would stalk back and forth , eyes would be all shifty , and he would be paranoid about crazy things
1	I told him that he needed to see a therapist and talk with someone about these problems
1	Eventually he started accusing me of cheating on him
1	He started telling me that I was talking to people on line , which I was nt
1	one day he got really mad and told me that he threw away the photo albums and pictures from our wedding
1	He gave me the silent treatment , which he does every two to three weeks , everytime he is mad or upset at something
1	A week later his house is broken into and the only things taken were the photo albums and his wedding ring
1	He then accuses me of robbery , and has the police sent to my house
1	I tell them that it was not me
1	About 3 months later after another outburst , he starts sending me picture messages of pictures from those albumsthe same ones that were supposedly stolen
1	When I asked where they came from he said from the album in the closet , like nothing
1	He finally started seeing a therapist , which I have never met
1	They told him he has OCD for pulling his hair out , and washing his hands stuff like that , but he wo nt tell me what else is wrong
1	I know that he went to see them and he was in such a state one day that they called someone over from the hospital to give him a shot to calm him down
1	Ever since going to the drs he has been sending me messages and text telling me that I am bi polar , or manipulative , ect
1	Since being back or trying to be back with him I have done nothing mean , or manipulative
1	I have helped him in his job , fixed things around his house , been there for him when he is sick
1	The final straw was it has been over a month since talking to him
1	I told him I was just done I could nt deal with it anymore
1	He sent me a text and I responded and told him to please leave me alone , he then called my job , and in an angry voice told me he was filing a protective order against me
1	I went to the police station to talk with them about what I should do
1	THey told me he had indeed been there that morning
1	But that they had told him there was nothing that they could do
1	They said he showed them text I sent back in responses to his messages and that there was nothing in them that would warrent a protective order against me
1	He did not take their word for it and went to the magistrate to see if they could issue one and they told him the same thing
1	I believe that he needs serious help
1	I know he said they prescribed lithium or something of that nature but I do nt think he is taking it all
1	My problem is that he always eventually shows up again
1	He will say he is sorry , remind me that I love him , or want to be with him
1	Says he wo nt do this anymore , says he is getting help
1	I told him I thought he was bipolar or something to that effect
1	He says that I blame him for everything and then he turns around and says that its my fault
1	That I provoke him
1	Or I caused him to be this way
1	I am taking the officers advice and have not sent any text , email or tried to contact him in any way
1	I just do nt understand why he does this
1	I have asked him if he really thinks this behavior makes it any better , he just keeps getting worse , and going to the extreme
1	He does not act like a normal person acts when they are in a relationship with someone
1	I would love for him to get the help that he needs , but I ca nt be the one to give it to him anymore
1	He has sufficiantly cut me out of his life
1	I have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder 5 years back when i fell into depression and took a mixture of xanax and ecstasy and tried to commit suicide by jumping off a roof of a building
1	Luckily a friend grabbed me before i jumped
1	And i thought after i was released from the metroplex pavilion that maybe the doctor was wrong because i felt fine and thought maybe it was a effect of the drugs mixing together or something
1	As time progressed i noticed that this pattern of irregular behavior and drug abuse was just getting worse then before and before i knew it i landed myself in jail and from there things continued to get worse
1	I was sentenced to 5 years probation and thought maybe i could get myself back on track but I was wrong
1	I still noticed these irregular patterns of behavior and i got more into drug and alcohol abuse and more and more problems came alone
1	I became increasingly violent with people , feeling like people do nt care about me , etc
1	Now i just recently took interest in my diagnosis with BPD since i do notice the symptoms in myself
1	there is a lot more to just this above i just wanted to fill you in a little so you can get a ideal of what i am talking about and I am afraid of what might happen to me because i noticed these symptoms are becoming stronger in my life and i 'm starting to push people away from me again without even noticing
1	Please I do n't have insurance so i ca n't go to a doctor to get help and i really do n't know what to do
1	I do consider myself depressed and i do have suicidal thoughts constantly
1	I just do n't know where to go for help or what to do and I want to get this under control so i can have a better life with my son and my family
1	I was diagnosed with Borderline about 4 years ago , but I 've been depressed and all around screwed up since I can remember
1	My mom is bipolar and I can vividly remember her depression and mania and the hospital stay 's throughout my childhood , yet my mom always seemed to try and be there for me when she could
1	My parent 's finally divorced when I was 15 and I have n't talked to my Dad since partially because he blamed me for the divorce and we are so much alike we just butt heads
1	I 've been to numerouse doctor 's and psychiatrists and been diagnosed with anxiety , depression , bipolar but none of them fit until I waas diagnosedwith borderline
1	I was relieved at first because I finally understood but it 's killing me and the people I loveI Hurt a lot and when I 'm happy it just scares me now because I know somethings going to change and I will go into a rage , and lately I 'm just exhausted from the constant ups and down I go through i a day
1	sometimes I can have a few months and I feel moderately fine but right now I feel like I 'm battrling a monster inside and nobody get 's to see that , they just see the crazy side
1	I 'm only 25 and I ca n't do this for much longer
1	I used to be able to talk to my mom about this kind of stuff because she understood but I feel like she 's pulling away from me
1	I moved away from home when I was 18 and breifly moved back in with my mom a few years ago because I needed help
1	I had justleft my first husband and I was very anorexic and only about 70 pounds and I just could n't take care of myself , I really thought I 'd hit rock bottom but my mom was n't there for me
1	It 's like she knows that I 'm screwed up and always have been so why bother , and so another parent turns their back on me when I need them
1	Now I 'm working on my second marriage and I 'm losing my best friend
1	I 've never loved someone like I love Adam so why do Ido the things I do to him
1	I 've done so many things to him that now Idon't think he 's capable of helping me , I 've just hurt him to much
1	Iasked him for help and he just did n't want to talk about it because it might cause another fight , and I understand where he 's coming frombut I wish it could be different
1	Him and I have a 14 month old baby girl and she 's the most important thing in my life and I 'm already hurting her just by fighting with her daddy in front of her
1	Inever wanted kid 's for this very reason but God blessed me with her and here I am now
1	I do n't ever want her to experience the things I haveand I think sometimes she 'd be better off without me
1	I do n't know what to do anymore and I 'm really at my lowest point , Ihad a really bad episode last night and I 'm ashamed of myself and sorry only goes so far anymore
1	Adam and my baby do n't deserve this and I do n't deserve them so what do I do
1	I 'm willing to do anything at this point to get help , I want to stop hurting my loved ones and my only other choice is n't an option
1	I need to know what work 's do I go back on med 's that just numb me
1	Iwant to live a life not just get by each day , I know deep down inside I 'm a good person and I want that side to show , someone please help me
1	Okay so about a month ago I took I believe 20 pills of Midol , first 24 hours I felt my heart racing and started feeling anxiety
1	Then after I started vomiting , and started feeling pain in my stomach
1	I did not tell anyone that I took pills I just told them I felt bad
1	I guess I did as a cry for attention or help , I do n't really know
1	My parents had to go to work so they left me hoping I would get better
1	I had later to go to the walk in clinic where the doctor was n't helpful he just gave me some pills for anxiety and that 's it
1	I started to really regret doing it , and decided that it was better for me to go to a hospital
1	So I did and after hours of waiting they finally put me on IV and did some urine and blood tests but they could n't find anything wrong with me
1	They wanted me to stay over night but since I felt better I went home
1	The next morning I just went in for some ultrasounds but I already knew they would n't find anything
1	Monday of this week I did it again but now with Tylenol extra strength , same amount 20 pills , Do nt ask me why cause that is one of the things I 'm trying to figure out here
1	I would never want to go through the pain again ever , and I 'm too scare to ask people I know for help
1	I do n't understand it myself , I 'm an excellent high school student , I have lots of friends , and a really loving family , people are ven jeaoulos of my lifestyle and I do feel overall happy
1	Something I should probably mention is that everytime I take this actions , I usually just had a fight with a friend or problems with my ex ' boyfriend and his new girl
1	But I honestly do n't even remember after a while that I had in fact taken the pills , like is just black in my mind and it takes me a while to remember why I 'm feeling the way I 'm , and that is what scares me the most , can I control this somehow
1	We 'll i m going to try to put this into something people can understand What I mean SPOILER if your not going to read the full story Do n't Comment We 'll for the last 2 freaking year 's I have n't been able to find anything that interest me I do n't like talking to people and actually rather it be that way because people make me want to hurt them when they talk out of ignorance
1	I have n't told anyone this but Below I woke about 1 month ago and was getting ready for school while i was waiting for my bus I starting Feeling like I was n't in reality I started thinking about going in my house and hurting someone in my house with no consequences i do n't usually Feel like that Reality left me for about an hr
1	What do I mean when I say Reality Left Me
1	We 'll it goes something like this when those thoughts hit me I felt really good i actually could laugh and smile
1	Felt like I had no control for what I would Do
1	LASTLY I feel like no one can understand me , I feel lonely I do n't talk to anyone in my family have n't for about 4 months , I stay in my room listening to music and suffering this stupid unending feeling I have felt for 2 year 's
1	i m tired of people saying its life or , you need to go to group Counseling
1	that 's truly how I feel right now and have for Years
1	I was grounded and yelled at for everything I did or did not do
1	Did n't wash dishes directly after supper , coming home from the library and that is the only place I ever went a few minutes late , getting an F on a paper I was grounded for 5 months for a single F in a class in which I was excelling , coming home late from soccer practice without calling I would have missed the shuttle bus if I 'd run for a pay phone , not liking what 's for dinner she was no culinary genius , and I 'd told her what I did and did not like
1	I had a tenoclock bedtime until the day I left home for college , and if I was caught reading with a flashlight I could never sleep , because I never did anything I 'd be grounded
1	I was also grounded for something normal , liking shooting my mouth off , but that 's what people DO when they 're angry
1	She was better when my dad was home
1	The last time I was grounded 17 years old , my dad was supposed to be at a 3week conference
1	He was n't gone an hour , when she flipped out about something and grounded me for 3 WEEKS
1	He was home the day after next , because he never received notice about the conference being canceled
1	I told him about it , and attempted to explain that I did n't do anything
1	I asked him if he noticed anything funny about my being grounded for THREE WEEKS when he was supposed to be gone for THREE WEEKS
1	Since I never really DID anything she could ground me from we were in a new location that I did not like , he just laughed it off
1	The woman is actually our stepmother , but my brother and I welcomed her into the family with open arms I was 9 , he was 7 our biological mother died when we were 5 and 2
1	I 've since learned from our brother and sister that she has always been like this they 're 13 years older than us , respectively , but that does n't help much , either
1	They , too , and to put up with her screaming obscenities and grounding them , though they generally ignored it
1	I 'm still angry about the way she treated us
1	My dad was home more often after I left for college , so things were easier on my brother
1	He does n't seem to remember how she screamed at and hit us , and seems to go with the school of thought that I really was a complete and selfish   as I was called
1	I tried telling my dad about this on more than one occasion , but he 'd either get angry or make it a joke
1	When I was still living with my parents , when my dad was home , he 'd either play his computer games , read a book , watch TV , or goof off with his soldier buddies
1	When I asked him for help on my homework , he 'd yell if I did n't understand it quickly enough my mother would hit
1	If I mentioned something that I did n't like about something he or my mother did like , I 'd be in trouble
1	I 'm going to be twentythree soon , and I do not want to be angry about this for the rest of my life
1	I do n't know how to cope with the way they treated me , though
1	I do nt know what it is abbout me
1	I know I have some problems
1	I can comfort myself sometimes by telling myself that it is n't ME that people ca n't stand to be around , it is the physical manifestations of my conditions that people do not want to be around
1	It makes for lonely life , but like I said , after spending a lot of time siucidal over it , now I am at least able to see that it is n't ME that is offensive to people , it is my conditions
1	She does nt like me when I am having physical issues , but she even does nt like me when I am having a better day and trying to get her to watch a 30 minute sitcom with me
1	I even fast forwarded through the commercials we have a DVR downstairs so that she would n't have to sit with me for the full 30 minutes
1	Even my dad tried to get her to sit down with me before he left for meetings
1	I have been having a really bad day , but I went all the way downstairs
1	But she got up and left the room without a word about 3 minutes after he pulled out of the driveway
1	I guess , I just do n't understand
1	Part of me thinks maybe she really does have BPD and maybe that is why she does the things she does
1	But why would she wait till he leaves and no one can see it , then she just gets up silently with out even letting me know she is no longer going to be watching the show with me
1	I feel like that is silent treatmet even though I did nt ask her a specific question that she was refusing to answer , I think she knows that by getting up and leaving me alone in the room without even saying anything
1	I think she has to know how much that hurts me
1	I want to think she does nt know , I want her to be just confused
1	I think I know that she is choosing her actions very carefully , and I know her well enough to know that she is aware of it when she does things like stay silent as she leaves a room that I am in
1	Before my dad left the whole idea was that we would sit down and watch it together , her and I
1	I think he was trying to help me
1	Trying to help get us both on neutral ground that was positive and smiling to hopefully begin to heal some of the damage our relationship has sustained since I started standing up and telling people about the physical violence
1	Why is everything I have tried to do for her not enough for her to like me
1	Why does she go out of her way to do things , or make litle comments that she knows cut me to the core like a knife
1	I can''t help but think it is either that she just really does n't even like me
1	Like the real me , she might like the me that she wishes I would be , but the me who I am now , I think she does n't want to be its mother
1	I feel like she does nt want me to be her daughter , that she would rather have someone who is more like her and who is n't always asking for extra help that she would n't otherwise need to give if I were a regular daughter
1	I guess , I do n't even know why I am writing this
1	I will probably tell my dad that minutes after the garage door closed she got up and went outside to lay on the deck and read books and smoke and work on her tan
1	Before all the things that it ended up causing my current situation , before , I would n't have been so dependant on her showing me that I was worth something
1	Because I had work , and I was so good at it that it was kind of easy for me to pay attention to something else that I felt made me worth respecting and paying attention to , and spending time with , etc etc
1	Now I do n't have the ability to produce the things I used to
1	Because I do n't have any way to prove to her that I am worth speaking to when you leave the room
1	How can she not see how her actions make me feel like a nonperson I am just a lump of flesh in a chair or on a couch that does n't even warrant basic human curtesy
1	I know she has to be able to see it , because I know that one can not accidently forget to say a word while chosing to get up in the middle of a show that we are supposed to be bonding over , walk past me as I am talking , and open the door , walk through it , and close it , all without a word
1	I feel secure in saying that is not me being paranoid or oversensitive or all PTSDee
1	SHe has done that same thing multiple times to me in other rooms when we are both in them under the impression that it is quality mother daughter time
1	I do n't know how to feel about this , and her , my mother , who I want to love me , and who I depend on for cargiving help and transportation to the Dr
1	I do n't know how much of it is my fault
1	I do n't know how to tell her how much it hurts me , because it seems like that is what she is trying to do
1	It feels like she is trying to make me hurt as badly as she thinks I SHOULD hurt based on whatever issue she thinks she is explaining to me by her actions and by saying one thing while she obviously means another
1	I feel like if I did n't have all the issues I have , I would be able to handle it , I would be able to not make it hurt so much
1	The only thing I know to do when I encounter people like this in my life , people that take more energy from you than they ever ever give , is to just walk away from them
1	That is what I always did in my life before the physical issues
1	But I ca nt walk away from her because we live here number one , but most impotantly , because I depend on her for physical help during the day , and for driving me places
1	I am in the process of trying to make other arrangements for my rides places , but its not like there are people all over the place with nothing to do but drive me around
1	I will probably post this is the BPD forums and the PTSD ones to see if anyone has suggestions on how to manage this issue , and mostly how to manage the idea that my mom can not give me what I need in a mother
1	My 18yr old recently became pregnant , not married and last week broke up with her boyfriend
1	She still lives with me
1	At home , she rarely helps with daily chores , her room is constantly a mess
1	She uses my bathroomshower to get ready
1	She wears my clothes , even my underwear
1	She rarely does her own laundry , hence wearing my clothes
1	I pay for her car insurance , her cell phone , and was paying for her car until she got into some trouble with a friend in Jan and I let my son start driving the car now
1	So , she often takes my car to work , has only helped with gas maybe twice since Jan
1	I want to be a supportive mother and help her with living , and when the baby comes , but She completely takes advantage of me and my home
1	When she was in high school , graduating was the most important thing and so i never pressed the issue of her paying for her own phone , or car insurance
1	I know my poor choices have not taught her to be responsible , so I am not blaming her completelybut she knows right from wrong
1	My own parents were very poor role models , both alcoholicsso I pretty much raised myself and have no guidance as to how to teach my kids to ' live '
1	She is a little over a month pregnant and she needs to realize how much her life is going to change , and that mommy is n't going to bail her out of this one
1	So I started getting molested at 7 by my uncle told my mom she did n't believe me then at age 10 molested and raped by my brother in law once again told my mom and sister my mom called me a liar and a   she then left me alone with him he babysit me when they went to the bar and out but when he was alone with me he would touch me and trying to undress me as I fought back and said no he would undress me complete ly and do his business he went down on me fingered me and etcit kept happening and still at age 11   12 same thingbut at age 12 he forced his penis inside me it hurt pretty bad he even came in me but did n't care I told him I was going to tell he said if I do he 'd kill me he even grabbed my throat jerked me and etc pushed me on bathroom floor after I ranI told my mom she still did n't care then still 12 she was smoking crack and having me have sex with Mexicans for money they did n't use condoms ever At 13 I got in a relationship guy was 20 I think we messed around had sex all of the abovebut still my mom made me have sex with guys for money for her for crack if I did n't I got beat with a 2 by 4 belts metal on belt piece from blindsand anything she could find I got pregnant at 13 had a baby at 14 I was still being raped and etc at 14 I went to school told the counselor that night police cars were everywhere and social services to take me my baby and my niece after this I began getting visit s with my sister which she had my brother in law picking me up when he did he 'd put his hand in my pants while driving and play with me then pull in a parking lot and made me go down on himthen go to his home where my sister was n't home yet and he 'd have sex with me finally after a few visits I got really scared told my tutor and foster parents I freaked and could onto tell the cops they did confront my bro in law but he never got in trouble
1	Still I went on my visits I 'm 16 at this time he still does this but I 'm able to fight off more nowso I finally stop seeing them
1	I age out of foster care at 18somehow he finds out where I live breaks in and rapes me I moved again with my boyfriend at that time and he again finds out where I live and gets in through front after my bf left for school rapes me while I was sleeping I wake up scream call cops they do nothing then at 19 he does it breaks in I then fought threw pillows called bf and he leaves after that it was it I confronted him about it and he says he wo n't talk to me over the phone email or anything but will in person if I have no phone on me and I 'm alone
1	I never went but I hat d my mom and sister cuz of all this my sister still do n't believe me I 'm 20 now and I told KY mom I hate her and she died in August I feel so bad still to this day I have nightmares bout him raping me any advice
1	My daughter is 4 years old and is having a hard time understanding why her father is n't a part of her life
1	I had been with her father for a few months but had known him for a few years
1	When I was five months pregnant I moved to TN to live with my parents for financial reasons and because her father had made it pretty obvious to me that he was n't ready to be a good dad
1	Two weeks after I moved he was arrested and this was when i finalized my decision to never go back to him
1	I made him aware of this decision but also told him that I hoped he would do what he could to be there for his daughter
1	Since this time he has made no efforts to see her and refuses to see her anytime my daughter and I take trips to CA
1	He accuses me of being crazy and that is why he wo n't see his daughter it is n't worth it to me to see her if it means I have to see you has been his response
1	I do n't see him being in her life anytime soon , if at all
1	He blames the whole situation on me and seems to be incapable of taking any responsibility
1	My daughter cries periodically about him not being here and I try my best to console her
1	How do I explain to a 4 year old that their dad is n't in their lives without making them hate their father
1	I do n't know if he will ever be a part of her life or not and do n't feel that it is right explaining his choices when they do n't even make sense to me
1	She asks me to call him but contacting him in the past has never resulted in anything positive for myself or my daughter
1	I just want to know the best way to address this issue without giving her false hope of killing any chance of seeing him positively
1	How can I get my doctor to take me serious
1	With my now previous physician , he told me to go home   research on the internet and get back with him on what I find and maybe together we could find out what 's going on
1	Well , I had lost 40 pounds in 2 months wo trying
1	I was having big time sweating at night soaking my clothes , and on   off temperature
1	Well , I have other diagnosed issues and several surgeries behind me
1	Anyway , I 'm losing more weight again , I 'm nauseated vomiting everyday , sweating badly at night , on   off temperature low grade , I do have lower pain abdomen I guess it is and close to my cervical female area I suppose is that area
1	I stand and I suddenly feel at times that I 'm going to pass out , but I do n't
1	I know the feeling well , because I 've passed out before
1	Oh and also , I 've had a swollen lymph node for several months now
1	Anyway , I 've discovered that I now have 2 more swollen lymph nodes that just appeared
1	I 'm worried because of how I feel
1	My grandpa had breast cancer yes , my grandpa , melanoma , and he had colon cancer
1	I do n't know my father 's side
1	I saw that it appears he could have passed away at the age of 50 from my searching
1	His family does n't know me   I do n't know them
1	Anyway , I do n't know how I 'm going to be able to get my new family doctor to take me serious
1	I 'm sick of this and having all this on top of my other pains is overwhelming
1	I need to find a doctor that can help me and get answers and get me feeling 50 better at least
1	My heart races more too I have POTS
1	I have been to the doctors recently in trying to fix my mental health , After informing them that I was feeling depressed with anxiety , they gave me a prescription for citalopram
1	I could not get therapy for three or four months , so for some reason I did n't bother with it , hoping in time that the citalopram would get me back on my feet
1	The citalopram at first helped me throughout the first two months , but then I started getting worse , I had really bad anxiety around people , so I stopped it all together
1	Many people have told me that they think I might have a bipolar disorder , my history has been quite troubling as I have done many things spontaneously that I consider afterwords completely mad for eg
1	Borrowing a lot of money from payday loans even though knowing fully well that I could n't afford to pay it back , getting fired for unlawful social networking , stealing money from my parents
1	I seem to have constant mood swings throughout the day
1	Whenever I go out with friends , I seem to have problems
1	When drunk I tend to have no control and end up doing something very harmful to others around me , people have noted that my mood seems to change drastically when drinking and or taking other drugs
1	I have missed many interviews for important jobs because of getting intoxicated the night before , I have trouble maintaining my sleeping pattern , I over eat or do n't eat at all , I have had in the past , problems with leaving the house and being outdoors
1	My question is , Is there anyone I can talk to about this
1	So that I can hopefully get a better understanding as to why I am doing this
1	3 years ago she began treatment at as outpatient
1	The Dr prescribed Luvox I think the initial dosage was 50 it was cut to 25 about 1 year ago which helped her work through the things causing depression and she is well on her way to recovery by her own admission and I concur
1	She wants to stop the medication safely , but her doctor is reluctant to allow her to stop
1	FYI , we live in Japan and Japanese doctors are assured payment by Health Insurers by prescribing medication
1	Please note that I not kidding , every doctor I have ever been to here has either prescribed or WANTED to prescribe some medicine
1	In doing her own research and through a support group , she came to know the most depression patients are prescribed Luvox for only 6 months here in Japan
1	We want to have a baby and met with the doctor last year in October , who all but assured us that by now my wife would be free from Luvox , but as he has not agreed to any changes in medication amount , my wife began taking things into her own hands
1	Over a period of months , she has been able to reduce the medication to 18 of one pill every other day
1	2 when she goes for too long without taking the medicine , her symptoms are dizziness , tightness in the back of her neck , and general malaise   are these usual withdrawal symptoms
1	Should we continue to ' avoid ' pregnancy to the best of our ability
1	She has a recent history of paranoia in that she feels that there is a conspiracy against her , including her spouse and myself and my husband
1	She feels everyone is out to get her
1	She also says she hears voices in her home and when she goes to check on her husband in another room to see if he is talking to her , he may , in fact , be sleeping , and she still thinks he is talking to her
1	She thinks he may be in the other room on the phone with a girl friend
1	She is always suspicious of him and constantly checking his cell phone and email to see if he is having an affair
1	She has two young daughters , 1 year and 2 years and she says she is worried to leave them with anyone , even family , for fear they will sexually violate them in some way or hurt them
1	She also recently had two episodes , a few weeks apart , where she was cleaning and all of a sudden thought her finger was broken and the pain was intense
1	20 minutes later , she looked at her finger , and there was nothing there
1	She said it had even looked twisted to her
1	When this happened the second time , and while she was having the pain in her finger , she took a picture of her finger so she could look at it later
1	She showed me the picture and the finger is absolutely fine but she said , at the time , the pain was intense and it looked twisted and broken
1	I 'm worried for her and my granddaughters
1	My friend and boyfriend are both heroin addicts , the friend has been on it for probably a year and he shoots up at least 8 times a day
1	He was recently diagnosed with Hep C from using dirty needles i m assuming
1	My boyfriend has been on it for about 4 months , he does nt shoot thought , thank God
1	They both are the most hard headed people i 've met as of now
1	They argue every single day , and its always about dope
1	And now matter what i tell them , and how hard i try and talk to them , its just like they do n't are
1	I m terrified , i mean i m only 16 and i feel like i m in the middle of this horrible situation
1	I 'll ask my boyfriend to quit for me , and i thought he would but no
1	And when i cry about it he gets mad at me
1	I just do nt get why they do nt understand
1	The friend has already been through a detox , he relapsed , so there s no helping him , he 's going to die in the next 5 years i m guessing because the hep c and the heroin everyday
1	But my boyfriend has only been using for about 4 months , and i want help
1	But he will NOT go into rehab , so am I stuck
1	These poor kids are only 17 and 18 , and i do nt know what i m gon na do when i loose both of them to this evil drug
1	I feel like i could seriously write a novel right now
1	But i would just like as much information as possible , thanks for your time
1	My Husband is living with his exgirlfriend
1	I 'm no sure when she moved into my house but am wondering if he has been having an affair
1	I did n't realize he could do that to me
1	I was devastated after 8 years of marriage
1	i also had an abortion a few years back because our baby would have Down syndrome
1	So I 've been depressed and thought he would always be there to support me emotionally
1	We argued constantly after we lost the baby
1	I did n't think of going to therapy and medication for my depression so it took a toll on the marriage
1	For a year , I 've been blaming myself for the separation
1	My husband called , text , and even had phone sex during the year
1	My husband said he was n't dating anybody and would never let anybody live in our house
1	I thought he wanted to work or out because he would call me every night to say good night and texted me 15 times each day for the past year
1	However , one Saturday night right before Christmas I tried to text him when he was going to call to say good night and he did n't reply
1	I went over to our house at 12 at night , I know it 's late but he said he was working till 1130p
1	i rang the bell and ask him who was in our house
1	I tried to go in to check on the house and saw that it had other decorationsfurniture beside mine
1	My husband and I are screaming , I walk into the house and demand who was in the house with him
1	My husband finally admitted that his ex girlfriend from high school was sleeping in our house
1	His girlfriend called the police because I was causing my domestic battery and I get arrested
1	I 've been known him for 15 years and married 8 years , but why did n't realize he could have an affair
1	Now I 'm wondering if he had been having an affair all these years we 've known each other
1	He has kept in contact with her through facebook and I always wanted to know why it was so important to him to have her as a Facebook friend
1	He kept saying they were just friends
1	I am so upset , depress , lost my job because I 'm am emotional wreck
1	How do I stop thinking about what I did wrong and why he lied
1	My partner and I have been together for 4 years
1	2 of his come to our home on a regular basis , the other decided she would n't , in a rather dramatic fashion
1	She easily manipulates the children and my partner and I try very hard to be honest and expect honesty and respect from our children , but that is difficult to come by
1	Since I have summers off , I have had my partner 's children tween aged here most of the summer , as their mother finds excuses not to have them when she does n't want them
1	When it comes to discipline , they are volatile , especially if it is me who is doing the disciplining
1	They seem to think that my children do n't ever get in trouble , which , believe me , they do and his kids have been here when they do
1	the boy is very outwardly disobedient with most people in his life that have rules for him to follow , yet he is a perfectly nice boy if he is getting his wayand things have to be his way
1	My children do n't enjoy being here when these kids are here and my biggest concern is that our child together will observe this behavior and grow up acting out as well
1	I feel at war in my own home and I just want peace
1	So if you new that your wife had started to have feelings for another manIs it wrong for me to be checking up on her she is just about done with a rehab program an my intuition has been telling me somethings not right
1	This program offers a yoge class which I thought was something they had to go to for the program
1	Well about a week an a half ago I found out its not a must go class
1	An another thing that was bugging me was it starts 4 pm to 5 pm an her must go class does n't start till 6 pm and she usaully leaves at 3 pm to go it takes 20 min to get ther e so it had really been bothering me many signs just on this one case we also have two children and one needs to be picked up by 430 well he was at home on monday an she said she was
1	So I had an hour an decided I was going to go an see if she was there
1	All the way there I was so nervous of her being ther catching me checking up on her and the thought of being right
1	Well when I got there guess what she was n't there
1	I finally told her yesterday I new she was skipping classes an lying to me
1	I asked her where she was an she says she was just driving around
1	Whicj is boloney driving around for 3 hours I think not
1	I told her I know a lot more then she thinks I know
1	But she wo n't come clean I know what 's going on deep within but I keep giving her the benifit of doubt
1	I have always trusted my wife to be faithful
1	Is she just trying to spare me anymore pain or is it exciting to be on the sneak
1	I do n't know but I think it would be easier if she just came clean
1	Cuz I 'm going out of my mind when she 's not at home
1	She also got all bent out of shape at me for checking up on her
1	I want to try an work out our marrage an I 'm willing to forget about what ever is going on we have 11 years together an 2 kids
1	For the past couple of days , almost a full week now , I 've been feeling this odd sensation in my head , more accurately the backside of my head on my right side and the top of my head
1	It 's like a weird cool and empty feeling shooting through before going back to normal that makes me feel like my brain went off for a brief second before turning back on
1	It always feels like I 'm about to fall out of consciousness but I never actually do
1	Prior to that I 've been having constant headaches , nothing serious like a migraine or something that leaves me unable to move around or to get out of bed
1	The headaches have subsided but this empty surge my head keeps getting is freaking me out
1	And now I 've began coughing with an uneasy stomach and white mucus coming out of me
1	I 'd like to think it 's just coincidences preceding me getting a common coldflu but I keep thinking what if I 'm starting to develop cancer or it has already developed and my days are numbered
1	I 'm not having any vision issues , despite the dizzy spells , and despite my nauseous feeling I have n't actually vomited or feel too sick
1	As far as I know I do n't have any swollen lymph nodes on me nor do I spot anything unusual looking
1	Besides that I 've just been having neck pains that may be brought upon by me just sitting and using the computer everyday when I 'm not at work
1	I did have a hospital visit nine years ago and the doctors revealed I was healthy albeit I do have an severe anxiety disorder that needs to be checked out , which I have n't done since then
1	If it helps any , I 'm 21 right now
1	I 'm going to try and sum this up as short as possible actually feels good to write this all out   My husband and I have been together for 7 years married for 3 with a beautiful 4 year old little girl
1	We 've really had our ups and down but this last weekend is really making stronger to leave my husband
1	My husband is very narcassistic in his ways NEVER apologizes and always turns the table around on me
1	a few years ago , I was a bartender and stayed out with the bar crew until about 5 in the morning
1	We were all friends and were hanging out , needless to stay I did nt tell my husband because I knew he 'd be so upset with me
1	My boss and his wife dropped me off at my house and my husband was so mad he threatned to divorce me , and said that he was going to take my daughter away from me
1	I was so apoloagetic , said I 'm sorry , begged for forgiveness finally after a week of begging he said he 's willing to try
1	He requested I see a counselor which I did we moved on but this past weekend friday I fell asleep in our daughters room reading her a story and tickling her back
1	I woke up about 1230 and looked around the house to give my husband a kiss goodnight
1	I thought maybe he just ran to the store he smokes and drinks often
1	I called him and said , just calling to say goodnight he never answered then I text him , no answer After he did nt return home   it was 145am now
1	I text him again are you ok
1	and called him 5 times no answer finally he calles me back at 230am and says he 's at his friends house and that he 'd be leaving soon
1	ne never let me know he was leaving , no note , text or call
1	then 445am rolls around and he just walked in the door the next day we did nt talk , he never looked at me , never apologized , nothing finally Sunday I go up to him and say How can a husband father , just leave his girls in the middle of the night without telling us where you were going
1	he responded with , YOU are over reacting , i did nt do anything wrong we got in a huge fight
1	I really do nt want my daughter growing up in a broken home and all I want is to be in a loving relationship
1	My husband really does love his daughter but how can he think this is normal and not wrong behavior
1	Since December I have had 26pounds of unexplained weight gain
1	During this time I also had the mirena but had it taken out bc I got such headaches from it
1	Today I had a recheck with my normal provider to check my iron and ferritin levels again
1	My ferritin was 10 back in feb with the normal being   14350 ngmL today it cam back at only 18 after being on iron 325 mg since feb My iron was only 29 in feb with the normal being 60140 and today it was 96
1	She is still keeping me on the iron to hopefully raise my ferritin
1	She wo n't be happy she said until its at least 50
1	She rechecked my thyroid and all my electrolytes today and all is normal
1	She is sending me for an endocrinology consult
1	Along with the unexplained weight gain I have been having horrible night sweats
1	I have always warn many clothes and many blankets to bed until a few months ago when i 've only used a single blanket and barely wear clothes if any and I sweat like crazy
1	Another tidbit to my story is that when we went to the IVF doc he told me that I am in the early stages of perimenopause and my AMH being only 06 very low for a 27 year old
1	I have been abused by my wife since I got married
1	I have to admit that I have made a couple of decisions in my life that my wife was n't happy about it that has made our lifes from an economic point of view more difficult
1	As a result of those decisions I get abused on a daily basis
1	We have three children and if it was n't for them I could take some action but I do n't want to risk my children
1	I know that if we got a divorce she would make sure my life is as misarable as it can be
1	We met in the USA and when I finished my degree I wanted to go back to my country but she did n't want to come
1	I was madly in love and I decided to stay
1	I had kept a few things to myself about my past relationship 's
1	She started a brutal interrogation that lasted for six months
1	Every detail , every action , everything she demanded to know and did n't stop till she got all the information through mental torture
1	What I mean about mental torture is that she would ask me the same questions for hours , days , weeks , months , non stop
1	She would argue with me till early morning hours non stop
1	There is always seems to be a reson for her to abuse me
1	She is not happy with her life and I get the blame
1	Today again from the minute i wake up she has been shouting at me
1	If you had bought a house when I told you
1	My dad is a 51 year old man who still swings out like a teenager with his anger
1	He has always had a problem with his anger but recently its getting worse and is starting to affect my own mental health in a negative way
1	He can go from being perfectly happy to extremely angry and back in the space of a minute and in his angry stages its really bad
1	The smallest things can make him angry , even just something as small as a lift taking longer then a minute to get to the floor we 're on and his angry outbursts cause him to scream and shout and throw things around without a care in the world even in public spaces
1	He often blames others for his angry outbursts , usually me being the only child of the family and a teenager
1	This happens all day every day , I ca n't remember a time where this was not the case
1	He has not been diagnosed with anything as he refuses to seek help
1	Its getting to the point where I ca n't handle it anymore , he has ruined all experiences for me and I do n't feel like I can keep going on like this , I feel like I ca n't go out with friends or anything normal due to being afraid of his angry outbursts , birthdays and christmas is never a good time due to it and he still refuses to seek help as he believes he is not in the wrong but other people around him are
1	I have my own councillor but I do n't know if it will be any use talking to her about this as she may have to carry information back to my parents which will cause his angry outbursts
1	Hi I m a 17 year old female , I am overweight
1	and i m very scared that I might have a brain tumor , the left side of my head sometimes hurts , like it 's not a headache type of pain but it 's more like a dull pressure type of headache , now it 's usually not worse in the morning , but usually worse during the daynight , and I had this head ache for around a week 3 weeks ago , and now I have it again , it 's only on my left side , usually when I have a headache I can my massage my eyebrows or temples and it will go away , but this dull pain just stays , also my left arm feels weaker
1	my left eyes eye lid kept twitching around two days ago and would nt stop , also my left eye seems to be getting worse and worse vision , but my contacts are old , and if I take them out and wear glasses vision is the same and my headache goes away a little
1	also sometimes I forget what I need to say , sometimes food does n't have taste
1	now My mom is an RN and she says that i m just freaking out
1	but I feel like I can actually feel the tumor
1	I do have a high level of anxiety , i Google about this at least 10 times a day
1	also when I stretch I get this sharp pain in my head
1	also yesterday I was almost asleep and my whole body like twitched
1	So I am going to tell everyone on here everything since my identity is unidentifiable
1	Please read and listen to my story and give me you 're honest opinions and advice
1	So I now live alone with my dad because my mother left me , my brother , and my dad when i was around 1 or 2
1	I have always been a pretty good kid my dad is a good dad he gave us everything we wanted , me and my brother both are amazing hockey player I 'm not just saying that to brag and my family is a good family , but there was always something missing to me , so i would rebel from time to time like any kid does
1	As I got older around 1517 that s when things started to change
1	My brother hung out with the wrong crowd and he started to do a lot of drugs and steal from home
1	From time to time over the year i would watch him get kicked out living in building staircases and police bringing him home
1	I would watch him get beat up from my dad almost on a daily basis
1	I watched him drop out of school , and ruin his life
1	When he was 17 that s when he left for good and we have never heard from him since , i do n't know where he is or what he is doing right now
1	For all I know he could be dead
1	This really   me up over the past two years because I love my brother that s my best friend
1	I know it messed up my whole family but they moved on and got over it , it really messed up my dad for a while and he learned to put on a happy face and go about his day for me because there was only us 2 left
1	So about last year grade 10 I started to hang with the wrong crowd and they changed me , I mean , I was n't totally bad , I still get good grades , I work at burger king and I do everything that I am told to do
1	But , from time to time i will go out to party 's and do drugs and get totally waisted , it is peer pressure i guess , but a part of me does not care at all
1	I came home black out drunk throwing up everywhere not knowing what happened the night before 2 times and I know that I could have died but i do it anyways , I have never seen m dad so angry or so hurt before and I told him I would change but i did n't
1	So a couple of days ago , I told him I was going out to the movies and I would be home by 1000pm
1	I went out with a couple of friends and got so wasted that I could n't move , I would n't wake up
1	They carried me home at 100am and I would n't stop throwing up
1	The next day my dad was so angry with me he beat me so bad I thought he was going to kill me i have so many bruises and black eyes
1	He keeps yelling at me like crazy and I 'm scared to say in the house anymore
1	He keeps telling me to leave and I know that I probably will make these stupid mistakes again and I do n't want to put him through this anymore
1	But i also know that it would kill him if I leave because I am all he has left
1	here i go My names Chris and I 'm 18 years old
1	wo nt leave the house for days if i do n't have to
1	i ca nt help myself from stealing things , destroying things in stores and anything else i can do if i know i can get away with it
1	it 's not that I 'm proud of it , its just that when I 'm there in front of it i just do it without thinking
1	i always lied and cheated my way through any obstacle i could
1	i can manipulate other people easily and i sometimes do it to a point i feel that i have complete control over somebody
1	sometimes i will manipulate somebody just to see if my tactic will work
1	When i hurt others mentally i 'm not physically violent
1	i feel no remorse or guilt , by none i literally mean i do n't feel a thing
1	in my head i sometimes feel like i could kill somebody just to feel somewhat betteri would n't
1	i feel as if people see me as weird , or just have something bad to say about me
1	i can feel my entire face turn red and i will sweat very badly and feel very hot at the same time
1	when i walk i tend to look down and i can not help myself
1	i tell myself in my head that if anything it makes me look weird but i feel better if i just tilt my head slightly and go from there
1	i dropped out of school because i simply could n't handle it
1	if i was even 10 seconds late for class i would end up skipping because of the thought of walking into a classroom and everybody looking at me was absolutely terrifying
1	I do n't know where else to turn guys so i m hoping you guys can give me some help
1	i feel like i m living a nightmare
1	i appreciate any advice or help you guys can offer
1	even after reading what i just wrote i feel ashamed but again its just how i am
1	I realize that I love hard and I am always seeking something and I do not know what that is
1	I have been happy lately because I have met some really great friends who really look out for me
1	Then , I fell in love with my friend who happens to be a girl last night she told me that she has been hurt and she is not looking to ruin our friendship by getting romantically involved and my heart is just breaking so bad
1	I do n't want to cry infront her because I 'm actually embarrassed about it and she already feels bad why make her feel any worse
1	It just feels like my heart is never satisfied and I do n't know how to not use others and fill the gap
1	I do n't know how to count on me
1	I do n't even know if this belongs in this forum , I am just wondering if the abuse is what makes me love so damn hard
1	When I love someone I give them all of me , I ca n't even stay away from them
1	I do n't know how to , I have been sleeping at her house alot lately and last night I went home and ended up right in her bed again
1	I could n't sleep in my own bed and its killing me inside because then she started saying how lately she 's been pulling away because she 's scared that I 'm getting too close and that I have broke down her defenses
1	As a friend I get that she has been hurt countless times but this is what everyone says to me , how sweet I am and how they found me when they thought all hope was gone , they 've never had a friend like me but that does n't stop them from leaving me
1	I usually have to be the understanding one , just sitting on everyone else to get over their broken hearts and just taking what comes in the name of understanding What is wrong with me
1	Me and my Boyfreind has sometimes problems when i felt that he does nt care for me
1	He approached his mom to marry me and his mother took one yer to respond him for his marriage with me
1	Anyhow she came to my home and things sorted out
1	By that time i applied to abroad for some research program and i wanted to go over there
1	I went abroad after talking to his parents about marriage
1	Now when i reached aborad after 3 months i got contract for another 3 yrs to carry on my research
1	I told my BF abt that and he said its okay i f u want to carry out , but now there will be problem
1	I was telling him to apply to that country so that we can live together , But in his opinion he was afriad to change his job and country and above all when his mother got to know about that m she cried infront of him and asked him not to move as they wll be alone if he moves abroad
1	She brainwashed his mind and now he do n't wants to come abroad
1	this made me mad and then while talking to him i shouted on him a lot
1	Now it has been one yr again and the things are more worst as his mother now says that this girl does nt repects you and she will not respect us either
1	If she will come back to our house then also she will not adjust , And my bf asks me the same question that his mother ask to him about me
1	I am far away frm him and most of the thime times we are just fighting over his mom apprehensions about me
1	He says that he do nt want to stuck in between his mom and me
1	So he wants me to understand all his problems
1	How to proceed further as i am afraid that his mother is  
1	Even if i will go back and marry him , his mother wil be there with us and my BF says that in any case he wo nt leave his house
1	I just had my first two rounds of chemo stage 2b HER2 pos
1	Every time I have any kind of treatment through my port I have this sensation of my chest and neck having pressure built up
1	I talked to my doctor and they think it Is an allergic reaction to the chemo , but of course they wo nt stop the chemo
1	I even spent some time in the ER because the pressure got so bad that we were trying to rule out a heart attack andor a blood clot in my lung , which I was showing all the symptoms for , such as a cough and a hoarse voice on top of the pressure
1	It is now time for round 3 out of 6 , every three weeks and I still have intense pressure in my neck at this time
1	I also thought it might be superior vena cava syndrome , but my port is fine and easily accessible
1	So , a little bit about myself and a little inside look into my past with my anger , and maybe you all can help me decide on what to do , andor give me some sort of assitance on what is wrong with me
1	Please keep reading , if you 're interested or think you may can help with my issue
1	I am 21 years old , I have just recently joined the Army as a 19D combat job , I am now stationed in Germany
1	I have just recently got married to my lifelong love , whom I met 7 years ago at the age of 14
1	Right now she is still back in the states awaiting approval to move to Germany with me
1	Ok , well there is some info about my life , now to let you know a little about my history of anger
1	From the time I was a teenager in high school and still to this day I have had somewhat of some anger issues , which started off very small
1	I would let things build up and build up , I would never really confront many people unless neccessary
1	Then eventually out of nowhere it would start hitting me , my mood would change for about a week , and I would explode on someone , then turn back to normal right after
1	I thought I was doing very well handling myself
1	Then it turned into me having outbursts about the most stupid things you could think of with my friends and family
1	I am a very calm and collected individual for the most part , I 'm not hostile acting , and I even handle most things that could make people angry pretty well , but when someone else is battling you with the same mindset , eventually I explode into an uncontrolled rage
1	It 's really not the little outbursts I have with everyone else that bothers me , but now its starting to step into my marriage and THAT is where my REAL problem lies
1	My wife and I are , as of now , stuck to the world of video chatting until she can join me here in Germany
1	Which is fantastic because I get to talk to her even this far away
1	But within the past couple of weeks , we have been getting into HUGE arguments , all of which are started because of one little thing that she is doing
1	I can honestly say that the things that are setting me off , are NO reason to get mad at all
1	I find myself going from my normal , sweet loving husband mode , into a complete RAGE for no reason over things like , my wife talking to people in the background of our convo
1	's online , or texting her friends while I 'm on there
1	Even the tone of voice when she says things to me triggers me into an extreme rage
1	The only way I can explain the way this anger , is to explain how I feel during it
1	When I turn into this anger mode , I literally lose all my ability to rationalize what I 'm saying or doing
1	Quite literally I am ' blinded ' by the anger , I get sort of a tunnel vision and am not aware of the things going on around me , nor can I logically think or speak , everything I say is out of anger , and I never let go of the one single thing that seemingly caused me to explode and I keep harping on it
1	I get to the point where I am yelling at her , and she is trying to handle it the best she can , then after she ca n't do it , the slightest attitude fuels the fire worse for me
1	Last night I was literally yelling at the top of my lungs over her playing a song when I asked her not to
1	I was completely irate about it , to the point where I screamed at her that sometimes she made me so mad that I wanted to kill her
1	Please note the fact that I am not a physically violent person with women , nor do I condone anyone else who is physically violent with women , yet this was just an outburst of something
1	And if it was n't important to my concern , then I would n't have included it , so take that into account
1	I am really scared of these outbursts pushing her away , as I know it has made us more distant because of it
1	Not only that but I realize that this is becoming a problem and I need to address it somehow before I lose my marriage over it
1	If I have left out any key information , or if I have rambled , please let me know , and if there is just some other information that you think may be helpful to this please inform me and I will comply as needed
1	I am a 22 year old white male 130135lbs

1	I have had such GADPanic issues before , but it has gotten disruptive so I decided to start up on some meds again
1	I have tried Zoloft , Celexa , and Paxil but each made me slightly foggy headed in the longrun and gave me severe insomnia while starting out

1	I do n't know where to go and who to turn to , i have confided in a friend with similar friends but we do n't speak often or see each other

1	I 'm 48 years old and going into menopause
1	I 'm still menstruating monthly but the periods are very light
1	My issue is about a week before my period I get severe PMS
1	I 'm not sure if its so much worse because i 'm going into menopause or if this is the new normal
1	I ca n't really talk to anyone because I 'm angry at everyone for whatever stupid reason
1	I become very emotional and cry alot , my face breaks out in huge weltsnot pimples more like blisters in the same areas every timeThe worst part is I get waves of such severe depression it scares me
1	It does subside after a few minutes but I 'm still depressed
1	If this decides to come for more than just those few minutes about 45 times a day I ca n't see how I will cope
1	I 'm very happy otherwise , just started a new job , moved to a wonderful home in a great town , my children are stable
1	I can feel it come on and I ca n't move or talk
1	It stops me dead in my tracks and I pray that it goes away
1	My fiance and I have been together for over 4 years
1	He 's 45 and I 'm 29
1	We have both been married before and have kids from our previous marriages
1	I have a 9 year old daughter and he has a 20 year old and a 17 year old who live in another state with their mom
1	It 's kind of a complicated situation because , while his kids are much older and living far away I was never in a position to be a step parent , I 'm just their dad 's gf , but he came into my daughter 's life when she was just 5 , and she lives full time with me us and her bio dad is not in the picture so he DID have to take over the role of dad with her
1	She inherited some behavioral issues from her dad along with ADHD and anxiety distorter
1	He finds her infuriating , and , after four years has all but given up trying to have any sort of positive relationship with her
1	The only interactions they ever have is when he is yelling at her
1	I feel horrible , heart broken , I m a mess
1	We love each other so much but it is so hard on me to have the 2 people who I love the most in the world constantly fighting and me in the middle
1	It 's depressing to know that I am marrying someone who hates my kid
1	I 'm hoping to get some insite from other step parents , because I just can not relate to how he 's feeling
1	We talk all the time about how important a role he plays in her life , especially bescause her bio dad is not around
1	He says he 'll try harder to have more positive interactions with her , but I do n't understand what 's so hard about it
1	This is really weird and I really do nt know how to describe how I am feelingSo i m just going to tryAnd if you have any questionsjust ask and I will try my best to answer
1	I have been feeling like this since I was around 15 or 16I am now 20
1	I will look at something and wonder If I am in a dream or nightmare
1	I think maybe i am being punished from a past life

1	I m 45 yrs old   was diagnosed perimenopause 2 yrs ago at the time I was have palpitation and hot flushes i was prescribed HRT but decided I would go down the alternative route   took Maca daily and this kept all my symptoms at bay
1	Over 3 months ago I started getting pains in both my arms my gp took bloods but I was only mildly lacking in vit D and questioned it could be fibromalagia
1	I then started getting mild flu like symptoms , palpitations , would shake all over as thou I could not regulate my blood sugarsNausea   loss of appetite , I also have heavy shakey legs and just did not no what to do with myself my GP thinks I have had a virus further bloods are negative I had my period and for 5 days I felt normal but when my periods stopped the horrible shakey leg thing and nausea has come back
1	I m due o return to work this week   not sure if I m up to it I had my fsh taken at my sexual health clinic but says I have to wait a full cycle before they will consider HRT they are unable to give me my results
1	I m desperate now my legs are driving me insane the only time i have relief is to keep going for walks I usualy exercise 4 times a week
1	I m a staff nurse in a busy critical care unit I need to get back to work but ca nt see this happening I m living of ibrufen   Antiemetic 's nothing is helping Are these symptoms menopause or viral
1	WOW I understand know why loseing weight is so important to me
1	Since I I feel my being depressed is so out of control I need something to even out to make me not feel so out of control
1	But I realized tonight that if I keep clinging to weight for control , it 's going to turn around and control me
1	So when I told myself I need to let go of loseing weight the first thing that pop'd but I ca n't because if I do I 'll have no control and I 'll be hopeless and with out it I 'll never be skinny or pretty so it really made me realize that my weight is ready starting to control me
1	And since I realized that it because my depression is making me feel out of controle I realized instead of putting all my time and effort into loseing weight I should being putting my effort in to getting over my depression because once it 's gone I wo n't even need weight
1	So now I 'm going to get serious and try and find myself some professional help and I 'm going to ask the pastor I 've been talking to help me to actually do this an not chicken out
1	Because if I do n't do this now I 'm going to end up being totally controlled by my weight
1	And my youth pastor said she does n't want to see that happen that it would be sad
1	So for her and for me I 'm taking control of my life while I still can befor it 's to late to
1	I 'm taking control by trying to give up what I 've been calling control and since I know I ca n't do that cold turkey I 'll do it in the way I can baby step by baby step
1	I 've had symptoms of depression and anxiety for about the last 4 years I 've tried Paxil Zoloft and I 'm currently on gabapentin 900 milligrams per day and lamotrigine working my way up to 50 milligrams per day
1	The reason for my depression and anxiety is a disease called Meniere 's syndrome , and it causes severe tinnitus
1	I just got a job it 's only on the weekends but I worry that without sufficient treatment of my condition I will be unable to work , be a good family man , ect What I 'm wondering is if my longterm and pretty heavy use of marijuana is having its own effect on my depression and if it is , how I 'm supposed to quit well in the midst of all these medications each causing their own side effects plus the fact that I ca n't really miss work
1	I 'm either getting too much sleep or not enough I feel a strong and general sense of malaise
1	I 've made appointments with all the relevant health professionals , but like appointments before , I fear that they are unable to see all the extenuating circumstances surrounding my depression , and therefore are unable to treat it as effectively
1	My appetite is crap I 'm losing weight I have no desire to eat unless I 've smoked marijuana and this bothers me
1	So how do I figure out how to treat my depression and anxiety while at the same time attempting to leave my marijuana habit it in the past
1	Also I 've been bombarded by ear worms sounds and songs that sometimes I have n't heard in years , but will play constantly over and over in my head
1	I hope I 've given enough information here for somebody to get a rough idea of what may or may not be going , on and suggestions for medications and medication combinations that may be able to treat the symptoms that I have listed , as well as any other factors related
1	I used to come here for support when I was first diagnosed as Bipolar 1
1	I was 16 I believe
1	It has been years since we talked but I do remember that I did gain a lot of helpful insight
1	I am 19 now , and am taking abilify for Bipolar 1
1	However , now I am just hallucinatingI have to go back to the hospital so I can go back to work
1	Though I feel it will be hopless , and I very well may be schizoaffective Dr 's have been going back and forth with those two diagnosis I was wondering if I could talk with young adults who are high functioningWhen I leave my housethe ground shifts
1	Everything is so damn loudRecently I smelled a mans colonge and the smell stayed in my sheets for days , my hair
1	I did not realize this was a delusion until I brought a friend over and the smell suddenly vanished
1	Being schizophrenicit runs heavily in my familyIt would ruin my life
1	My hallucinations , my sensitivity hypervigalence is just getting worse and worseIt makes me want to vomit , cry , scream
1	Hell , I am young , thin , I model , I work , I help my mother , my grandma with advance stage dementiaI want to be a nurseI can not live with this on my shoulders
1	I have to go back to the hospital tomorrow
1	I think my apartmentthe walls are trying to kill meI am such a burden
1	TLDR HELP IM A 19 YEAR OLD FEMALE SCHIZOAFFECTIVE WHO USED TO HAVE A BRIGHT HEALTHY FUTURE AHEAD OF ME
1	I Googled Coming off Lexapro and came across dozens of healthrelated websites similar to this where I read report after report after report of absolutely HORRIBLE withdrawl symptoms of people coming off Lexapro
1	One thing in common with most of these is that they would say they would go from , say 10 mg to 5 mg for just a week and then off of it completely
1	I am thinking maybe going from my current 10 mg to 5 mg for several MONTHS and then maybe 25 mg if it goes that low for several more MONTHS may be a better way to come off Lexapro
1	After reading these horror stories , I also think that I should maybe start up again with the psychologist I had visited at the beginning when my general practioner first prescribed Lexapro
1	At least then I would have a backup already in place to help me
1	I would like to try coming off of it in a few months but dread the return of symptoms and ESPECIALLY the withdrawl symptoms mentioned by others   like their brain restarting or rebooting every 5 minutes or their brain being turned into a sponge being squeezed every 10 minutes or getting an electric shock to my brain   YIKES
1	Lexapro has helped me a LOT over the last several months and has been symptomfree
1	But I am past what was causing me to be depressed
1	So please   if ANYONE out there has had good results from coming off Lexapro , PLEASE let me know
1	And also let me know what method you followed
1	I am a 15 year old girl who has been suffering a lot these last few months
1	My parents , friends and everyone around me are nt getting along these past few months
1	I have noticed that lately I m only happy when I m away from my family and doing something for me
1	I fight with my mom , a lot
1	And I feel like I reah out and no one can help
1	My best friend has suffered from depression for a couple of months now and I feel like I have the same things wrong
1	She and one other are the only people I really talk to about my problems
1	I have lost 5 pounds in 3 weeks I have recently been crying a lot for no reason or very little problem
1	I have become very mean I have began to cut myself
1	I 'm not suicidal it just makes me forget about the pain in my heart
1	Whenever I bring getting help up to my mom , she laughs
1	She 's the reason why I am so angry lately
1	She treats me like I am 5
1	Just small things that she does make me so angry and I end up freaking out and go to my room and cry
1	Mu mother in law has been living with us for 24 years now , right from the begining since I got married , I was never asked if I was ok with her living with us
1	she has been exterrmely dominating , all thru the yesrs , has complete control over my husband , he does not do any thing that would upset hr , I have no privacy in my life , as she will join us for my family events , holidays everywhere , myhusband would even take her to couple outings
1	she has been extreemely demading and wants my husband to spend time with her , take her on trips , buy expensive presents for all her family
1	this has gotten progressively worst , I have tired to talk with my husband but he feels there is nothing wrong , to the point that recently I had a biopsy procedure done but she wanted my husband to go see her daughter with her in a different state , my husband even without giving a second thought went with her leaving me alone
1	I have told him several times I do nt want to live with her and but he feels this is unjustified
1	I want to know what is my legal right in this regard , can he keep her in the house when I am not ageeable

1	yesterday I went dr for anxiety and not sleeping at night
1	told her about my husband had been on Xanax for about 3 yrs and I have no in , so when my sleeplessness started , and anxiety I took one of his Xanax at times and some times I would have to take 2 mg so she put me on 10 mg of prazac and 1 mg of Xanax
1	my question is I scared to death of the antidepressant because I have heard good people doing bad things on them I told her I was afraid of them but she insisted I take both
1	and I thought she was going to give me a pill so I thought I break it in half and work my way up to the 10 if the half does n't seem to hurt me , but when I got them filled it was the time released capsule and the druggist said I could n't break it in half
1	now i m scared to try the Prozac because you do n't know how it gon na affect ya till u take it
1	I do know the Xanax help it does n't do anything weird for me it actually works , i m not a pill popper i m afraid of most meds , she wants me back in 3 weeks and she gon na do a urine test on me
1	will the Prozac show up in the urine if I decide not to take it
1	it gon na take me a while to get up enough courage to take it , and she wants me to bring my bottles with me too
1	I see this as abuse but if not I am sorry
1	Me 28 male and my brother 32 male are used by our parents
1	I have had issues from this i became a hermit , i did n't leave the house for 5 years but my parents still found a way to make money from me about 700 a month for taking care of a disabled mother who does NOT try and get better
1	They told me this money was going to be used to get me better but 5 years later not one cent has been used to get me better
1	I would like to add that I took care of my mother for years before this job That 's all recent though
1	There was a time when I had real jobs but I never got to save as it all went to the family
1	The thing is my father is not right in the head as he thinks me and my brother are still kids and he thinks it 's ok that me and my brother have no future
1	Thing is , the reason we are not homeless is my brother
1	He has had a great paying job for over 10 years and he also has nothing to show for it
1	Yes , these are my parents but I want a life too
1	This would allow for me and my brother to save up money so we could leave
1	Me and my brother had i say had because it wo n't happen to move out together and go from there
1	Basically , all I am to my father is a house keeper , cooker and care for my mother
1	As you might guess it is hard to feel like I am a man here
1	I am starting to get better on my own
1	One day i told them i was getting a real job but would still take care of mother
1	Well , I have gotten NO support for this at all due to them finally telling me they were worried I would lose that 700 a month for taking care of my mother
1	They do n't care if i have no future
1	Heck , my PARENTS when I turned 18 actually forged my name for a credit card and maxed it out
1	I found out not by them telling me but by finding the bill in the mail and to this day they never paid any of the bill nor do they see anything wrong with what they did
1	My father has had many good jobs over the years but he never could keep them as he missed a lot of days
1	All he does is sleep whenever he gets the chance
1	On the weekends he sleeps nonstop i am dead serious , I do n't know how it 's possible to do that
1	He has a job now that only pays 200 a week because they put up with his missing days and because they offer good insurance so he can afford all my mothers drugs
1	When he was out of work we had a problem affording food as he paid cash for my mothers drugs
1	My father also has constant yelling fitsrants daily
1	I guess you could say he acts like a mean drunk but he does n't even drink
1	I also never had a real mother as when i was a kid if my mother was n't trying to kill herself and being in mental hospitals for months at a time she was drugged out of her mind at home
1	My mother has many physical problems also but again does not want to get better as trust me i tried
1	Just recently 2 or so months ago i did a lot of extra cleaning in the house so some people could give her a scooter
1	This scooter was supposed to help her do some stuff for herself and get her to a doctor to get her better
1	well after getting the scooter she said she needed more stuff to be able to go to the doctors etc
1	Keep in mind she said all of this AFTER getting the scooter and she has n't sat in it once
1	I realize this is a onesided story but i am just trying to tell how i feel with horrible grammar haha
1	I am asking for helpguidance i guess
1	I feel as though my life is a wreck , like my future is n't worth fighting for
1	I 've had depression , when I was 14 through till now 17
1	I have tried all the methods people have offered , ice cubes elastic bands talking to someone they helped but I still wanted a tiny bit of me to suffer
1	My family , Dad and my brother , are always disappointed by me they do n't say it but neither do they deny it
1	My Dad says i have a chip on my shoulder against my brother as he is the in my words ' The Golden Child ' he can not do anything wrong but when i do something no matter what it 'd be , i 'll get shouted at , cursed , blamed and I can never win the discussion and i accept that because truly it is my fault 55 of the time but when that 45 that is n't me i feel like jumping of the tallest build in stoke but then no one would be able to fight and stand up for me
1	I do n't really socialize drink but when i do i get even more depressed and start telling my friends everything
1	I do n't know what , where or how to be and even if I 'm meant to be here still
1	I have been married to the love of my life for the past 8 years
1	We knew each other when we were teenagers , and just happened to come back into each other 's lives when I was going through an ugly divorce
1	We started out as very close friends for 2 years before we fell in love and got married
1	It has had its up and downs , and we did actually separate for a little over a year
1	We both have significant health issues   primarily Fibromyalgia
1	A year and and a half ago , his mother became ill and he went to California to care for her
1	We see each other for two weeks every three months when he comes home for his own doctor appointments and while this is n't exactly bad , it 's the three months in between that are the problem
1	I can not be in California with him because my own mother is not in the best of health , my own health is deteriorating relatively rapidly , and my doctors are here
1	The last time I spent any time in California , his mother was verbally and psychologically abusive to me
1	The only good thing that came from that was watching my husband defend me
1	When he is home , it feels like we fall in love all over again every single time
1	I can not walk well and I ca n't drive comfortably so I pretty much have no friends
1	My husband is critical of everything I do or say
1	If I need to talk , his mother somehow manages to drag him away from our conversations
1	She makes him feel guilty about coming home to me every three months , and calls him constantly while he is here
1	We usually allow ourselves at least three days with the phone turned off to reconnect and really catch up on our more important things that we tend not to talk about
1	Most of our interaction when we are apart is via text and Gmail messenger
1	I know he loves me and I love him , but sitting in the house day in and day out with almost nobody to talk to , and facing various health challenges and medical appointments and procedures that would just be better if he was here is n't easy
1	We made the decision for him to go take care of his mother together , and decided up front that we love each other enough to make this work
1	I know she wo n't be there forever as her health is deteriorating rapidly
1	I am facing a minimum of three surgeries in the near future and possibly more things that I 'm afraid to even go forward with alone rotator cuff , torn hip cartilage , torn wrist cartilage , and possible reinjury to an old elbow surgery as well as a lump in my breast
1	I 'm depressed and in therapy but most of it is related to my injuries
1	He has other relatives in California who could and should be helping out more but who do n't except for the two weeks he is here
1	His mom needs 24 hour care and will not allow anyone else to do this
1	She claims she is afraid I 'm stealing her son from her and because I 've been divorced before , she refuses to even recognize our marriage as real
1	I 'm terrified of what might happen to me being left alone for too much longer
1	I'am a 31 m and have been fighting what i think is major depression pretty much all my lifeMost of the worst symptoms i ve had are constant brain foganxietydepressionracing thoughtsNow i have tried about 45 different ssri 's and have nt felt better from any of themIt 's always the same when i m on them as in i feel this adrenaline pumping like i want to jump out of my skin allll the time
1	No energy eitherOther strange things happen like my chest will tighten up when i yawn , and have this feeling run through my body which i guess is supposed to be a good feeling but i think its far from that
1	Do people who take ssri 's for depression get that same feeling when it worksProbably does nt make sense but its in no way enjoyable for meI end up stopping them after a few months as it gets to be too muchNever end up feeling any better , still the constant brain fog and anxiety
1	Anyways i m seeing a doctor on friday in hopes i can explain myself better to get on a new medicationI have talked to a psych doctor once about what i was feeling and he mentioned possible bipolarI know there are things like hypomania and what not but i Do nt stay up for days on ends or anything like thatJust nothing out of the ordinaryMy moods are either depression with anxietypanic attacks or really bad depression with the anxiety panic attacks and just not wanting to liveNever does my anxiety go away or the constant brain fog
1	I m scared to try another ssri as i know for sure those feelings are gon na come backDoes anyone have an explanation of the ' jumping out of skin ' feeling when on a ssrithanks
1	Hello , The other day I was hanging out with my daughter and I could see she was clearly upset
1	I asked her what was wrong but she did n't say anything at first
1	At first I let it go but a few hours later I asked her again
1	She told me the other day when she was home at her mothers FYI , we 're divorced she was drying her hair in the bathroom when she noticed an ipod phone peeking from under the door jam as if someone was taking pictures using the phonecam
1	The door has a size able gap and when she saw it it really freaked her out
1	She mentioned prior to that she and her stepdad were uploading pics from his iphone to picassa
1	When he was looking away she saw pics of herself , nothing revealing but unsettling nonetheless
1	Lastly , before school she always has her mom and stepdad give her outfit a ' once over ' before heading out the door
1	One time , according to my daughter , her mom was n't home and she asked her stepdad to make sure her outfit was OK to wear
1	Well he went up to her and as he was adjusting her clothes he ' slightly ' groped her
1	I 'm fuming with so much hatred but I want to do the right thing
1	My daughter said everything is OK and that they all had a talk at the dinner table
1	My girl told her mom who in turn confronted him but of course he denied it
1	She 's going to be 18 this year and leaving for college
1	She and her mom have been living with this guy for over 3 years now and this suddenly happened
1	At the very least I told my girl that she can move in with me
1	As far as I 'm concerned she can finish her senior year in high school and stay with me when she attends college
1	I do have a job and i try to function at itbut every one can tell i m losing it
1	I try and get out of the house , and do thingsbut i never feel good about myself and i cry
1	My first true love dumped me after 3 years because he was n't ready to settle down or have a girlfriend and wanted to party and do drugs and get wasted a month later started dating a good friend i introduced him to a few months prior who lived at my house with her 2 kids
1	I thought they were crushing on each other so i asked my friend not to come over to his house on the weekend and 2 weeks later he dumped me in South Lake Tahoe on our vacation , and a month after the break up started dating that friendshe also likes drugs heroin and meth and drinkingand i dontnow it has been 2 months since he broke up with me and a month of they dating and i m driving myself crazy
1	I was cutting after he broke up with me then stoppedbut when i found out they were dating my cutting came back , worse then ever
1	I ve been to the doctor and they do nt careand i ca nt afford to try and see them anymorei have never been so betrayed and i ca nt cope with it
1	I pray each night that i never wake up and each day when i get into my car i pray someone hits me head on just to end it for me
1	I 've neveer been so low in my life and i fear i can not make it anymore
1	i hit my head on a newly painted wooden block which balances my celing in home , i am having a minor head bump in my scalp right in TOP portion on my head at the edge of frontal lobe near the parietal lobe
1	AFTER THAT BLOW , THERE WAS NO CHANGES IN ME , I WAS ABSOLUTELY NORMAL , THOUGH I WAS RUBBING MY HEAD AFTER THAT PAIN
1	THAT LASTED FEW DAYS WHENEVER I TRIED TO COMB MY HAIRNOW it is over
1	that was a hard unexpected blow , when i was trying to jump and i got hit by that wooden block which was very near my head , not a a huge distance
1	i got hit many times like that before , but itdidn't affect me at allbut that time i think the momentum must be huge , because i hit that block by jumping a larger distance than before
1	that hapenned 8 months agoi do n't have headache , there is not a blood bleeding in my scalp or any other problem
1	i can feel onething clear , i feel a liitle dizzy while getting early for school in morning
1	i do n't feel any pain when i touch that areai feel difficult to concentratei now realize that i was deviating from my habits from then
1	it might be a scalp injuryi do have troubles in recalling i feel restless sometimes , very emotional , i was never like that beforea local doctor told nothing to worry that time
1	PLEASE HELP ME WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW
1	I AM A 17 YEAR OLD GIRL
1	I am a senior and losses in family and age has given me long term grief and depression
1	I tried Trazadone for about a year but did n't seem to get much help and I think it was making my sleeping problems worse
1	I then went to Sertraline Zoloft and have been on a half dose for 9 days 25 mg and will go to full dose of 50 mg on day 10
1	The side effects seem to add to my fatigue , which I already had due to griefbereavement
1	I have n't given up on Sertraline as I 'm yet to have a run at full dose
1	I am now under the care of my family doctor , not a psychiatrist
1	Both my grief , and the symptoms of as well as side effects are just troubling , not dangerous in my mind
1	But , I would like to get more enjoyment out of the life I have left being a senior I am on the endrun for life
1	It see in my bereavement group many suffer for years over the loss of a loved one , and perhaps never really get over it
1	My reason for seeking help from drugs is to help me sleep that could reduce fatigue and soften what I believe is depression
1	My family history has no known problems with depression , and I have lived a long life absent any troubling depression of course there have been many disappointments , but not depression until now
1	hey everyone , it 's not a question , just wanna tell my tale and ask for opinions , i apologize in advance that my story is a little long , here it goes well , i 'm 18 and studying to enter medschool , and i have an addicted father , abusive , emotionally and verbally and probably physically too if his body was n't a carnival of drugs
1	the addiction , is n't something new , as far as i know he started smoking opium regularly when he was a couple of years younger than me but has increased dramatically in the past 89 years
1	i think it 's a good time to mention that i 'm not straight , not openly , but with pretty much no sexual activity at all , because i believe it 's not right , anyways , the thing is , i had been caught , more than once , in fact several times but without anyone bringing it up i mean explicit webpages and media files
1	well , the start of all the legendary drama was about 7 years ago i was probably in 6th grade or so , with his mothers senility causing her lots of problems and her constant need of her son 's attentionwe lived in the same building , eventually she got worse and worse , and he would bring home nurses for her at this time , the drugs which he was addicted to were opium , heroincocaine dunno which , the white powder which is inhaled through the nose and the new development was crack and it came to a point that my grandmother had some internal bleeding due to blood thinners which made her death a matter of time , at this point , he would spend several nights at her house , not coming home and obsessing which obviously leads to the tendency to more drug usesome abuse had happened in this period as well , but their extent is nothing compared to what comes next
1	then her death came , he mourned , and so did i , and he wallowed , not having any fatherson interaction with me whatsoever , except for paying my school 's tuition and financial stuff , u could say he was more like a financial supporter than a father , anyways , my mother just did n't want to settle for such a low life as far as i can conclude , therefor several arguments took place , with him cursing my mother and her parents crucially , and i would stand by her defending her , not because i favored her but because it just was n't right , her parents had done nothing to him , he had no right cursing them , i also went in his room and told him if you behave properly and be reasonable , i will have your back as well , but if you do n't , i will stand up to you
1	then they got a divorce privately , and he rented one of the apartments in our building to a woman , with whom he then started a relationship
1	although they got divorced , he still lived in the same home with us , my mother and sister and I , making his room a fullyequipped arsenal of drugs and bringing inappropriate so called friends to share drugs , like 24 nights a week , still no quality time with me , father and son , but hey
1	i did n't mind , i just did my school , perfectly
1	and then he started to use WAY too much and the people he would hang out with some other addicts in the family especially his niece to get through to him and to his money , would make him aggressive toward us , repetitively , he would get so high that he could n't speak properly , and one particular night , under the same conditions , he came from his girlfriend 's place and started throwing stuff around and struggling to maintain his balance , shttalking started , lots of it , and i just lost it then , he tried slapping me a couple of times , i resisted , he accused me of being a bad son and how could i have forgotten that when i was a kid he would take me to karate school and how do i dare to raise my hand to him , along all the trashtalk which was obvious that had been planted in his head by the same people who fueled the feud the niece and the gf , and tried to hit my mom , telling her you dare team up with my children against me , again tried to hit me , but this time i stroke back , told him you 're just scum and easily pulled his hair and threw him on the floor , as i was crying , i told him it 's all in your head , there are no teams and no one will ever love you like the three of us
1	after a couple of hours of sleep i felt like crp , tried talking to him again like nothing had happened , but he still was high and etc this happened last year up untill now , there were several other fights , one which during he made me cry again , and i told him this is the last time you will see my tears
1	another ugly one was when the trashtalk he accused me of being responsible for my sister 's act of committing illegitimate sex which is frowned upon here he went in the garage to bring gasoline and burn us , my mother locked the door and called the police and then he broke the extremely fragile wooden door and somehow that ended too
1	note that i still have feelings for him because when i was a child he used to take me to amusement parks a lot and we would have a lot of fun along other fantastic memories , but i did n't have any more of them since the grandmother issue , i would hope that the same old father was somewhere in him
1	yesterday morning , was my day off from school and i had an exam the day after , like MANYa couple of dozen other days , i woke up from the shouting and cursing , running to the kitchen , yelling Comon
1	and with his notsoeffective patronizing voice and look , told me to shut up or else , and i said u know
1	you just are n't parents , your job description is to give heart attack
1	for a couple of hours he was gone , i managed to study , then he came back again and started another round , this time after lots of trashtalk which the extent of their insult had become much higher than the ones before , an event i did n't expect the fight got VERY physical with my mom , and she just would n't give up and hit him back , i just split them once or twice , being a bystander as i had been throughout the previous year 's fights because i had condemned myself of taking sides , even though i knew i had n't , i was just trying to be righteous and then somehow i threw myself in there , cuz there was no way i could take ANY MORE of this crp , so , as he was swearing that he would kill my mom by the end of the day , i said no one is gon na get killed , again , with a completely neutral tone , then he threatened me again , i got involved , disowned him as my father , and told him every single fact about his pathetic life and the moneyleeches whom he considers allies , and to count the days till his body is found in the gutter his final resort calling me a fag during a conversational banter with my mom since the fight was n't over , again told me who took you to the amusement parks and who got you all those prizes
1	i said my boyfriends since his last resort HAD , in fact , got to me , a LOT
1	and as i was going to the dentist , i told him try to overdose and die , ok
1	note that i did n't ask for much , just a peaceful environment to study this year to get into a university , and once in a while , some heart warming , more importantly i did not start any fight whatsoever , he himself would n't let us have a healthy relationship , always hoping that he 'll be a dad someday again , and i did everything that makes a parent proud and i m a good person
1	i do n't cause anyone trouble or misfortune , i play the piano , speak fluent english and a little french along our own language and another one , i also cook once in while , my reward is being called a fag
1	I 'm terribly sorry for the length of my Question but admit it , you will NOT , under any circumstance , find platinum drama like this anywhere on the globe
1	  anyways , i just wanted your opinions and your pointers , i 'm probably damaged goods , maybe it will help someone else
1	But my ESR was up to 48 and Dr not happy so am waiting for results of another blood test
1	They do n't know why I am feeling I 'll
1	Twice been shopping and needed first aider as came over hot then cold and shaking I had on another 45 panic attacks in 2 and a half hours am getting very frustrated now I car for my partner who is 45 and has suffered 2 strokes since 2008 I ca n't afford to be I 'll can anyone plse help give some ideas if my ESR could be a poss indication that something is wrong
1	I 'm a 19 year old girl
1	A few times now I have been angry all day , taking it out on my boyfriend and then crying all night when asked what has been wrong , I can not answer as I have no idea
1	This makes it worse , because then I 'm frustrated about not knowing what is wrong with me
1	I am taking Microgynon 30 as a contraceptive pill , but my Doctor told me that it should not affect my mood
1	I have always been an extremely emotional person especially since I was 14
1	I suffered major depression then , but that was caused by my grandma becoming terminally ill and problems with friends
1	I was suicidal back then , but I 'm not anymore
1	I can see similarities between the way I felt when I was 14 and how I feel now
1	I have great parents , and I have a boyfriend who I 'm very happy with
1	I am unhappy with my situation at university , but I do n't think it 's enough to cause me to feel depressed
1	I do n't believe in taking pills they only act as a deterrent , not a cure
1	I do n't feel as though counselling would help , as I ca n't think of anything that I would state as a problem in my life
1	Please help me I ca n't seem to stop crying or laughing
1	so first off i 'm 16 years old and when i was a little girl , about 4 my 12 year old male cousin and i , along with my mom and her mom , and maybe my sister who would have been 2 , were camping , and one night , i went to use the bathroom , which was outside , in the open , when i lifted up the lid to a cooler that was set in the ground , which i at the time thought the lid was a really round and flat white stone , he looked out the camper window at me and said i see you , him , being the only cousin i had on that side of the family , was a major role model , i remember i used to say when i grow up , i 'm going to marry   or patrick patrick was my across the street neighbor back when we lived further in town well when my cousin went to go use the outhouse , i naturally wanted to follow my cousin who was pretty much my best friend so i pretty much begged him to let me come , so i went with him down the rocky road in bare feet , past 1000 at night remember , i 'm 4 , it 's pretty late and he used the outhouse , after he went in , i went in i guess i wanted to copy him but i think i asked him to hold the door for me , anyways , i then asked him to come in with me , he eventually bent down and asked if he could touch me as in my vagina and i said yes , he then asked if he could lick it , and i let him do that to , after telling him to try it with his finger first if memory serves right i WAS 4 so i probably assumed it was the same rule as food , try a little first to see if you like it , i do n't know how long we were in the outhouse , i do n't why he stopped there , he could have done whatever , i never thought anything of it , not even 3 years later when i told my mom , the reason she did n't already know was because he took my hiking stick i had picked up on the way to the outhouse and held it high above his head and made me promise not to tell , so when we got back to nana my mom 's mom 's trailer , i woke my mom up and told her what he tolf me to say if she asked i went on a walk with   then we went to bed , actually i think we shared a bed , but i know we used to share a room at nana 's house
1	3 years later , i 'm 7 years old , i share a room with my sister , she 's asleep on the bottom bunk , and i call for my mom , because i had just made a promise to myself i 'm going to tell my mom everything you know cause secrets are dangerous , anyway , she told me to come down and tell her , i told her through tears , thinking she was going to hate me , she finally got me to tell her , tell me before daddy comes up he was in the sauna and i told her , i think she yelled for my dad , next thing i remember is them my parents talking , my mom was on the phone , probably with my aunt , who by then had had a daughter , who would have been 3 , and another , either on the way or just arrived , which are the younger siblings to , and i remember my mom saying something along the lines of no , how would she make this upimagine this she 's 7
1	eventually the police finnaly got a statement out of me , no idea what happened after that , i started counselling , ran into him there once , he was in the waiting room after my session had finished , i remember my therapist yelling THAT 's
1	now here i am , 12 years after the initial   whatever it 's called , i want a specific term at 1159 PM asking what the hell what happened to me is called , and now it 's 1200 AM
1	Almost at the end of the song , my mother makes everyone stop , runs and gets her video camera , points it at herself , then insists that everyone start over , while she sings along and fills in the blank with happy birthday to ME while she smiles into the camera while dancing around
1	It makes everyone uncomfortable , but they know she will throw a tantrum if they do n't play along
1	My mother also feels she has the right to give out my sister 's   to completely strange men , insisting it is HER life and she can do what she wants , even though it 's not her
1	I went cross country skiing with her 4 years ago
1	She came up behind and fell on her butt just like I did
1	Her tailbone hurt and we walked back to the car
1	Now , 4 years later , she retells the event She fell , hit her head , was knocked out , woke up on her face to me standing over her laughing
1	Also , she asked me to knit her a poncho , then accused me of using evil , hateful colors red and black and would n't take it
1	She makes 80,000 grandyear , I asked for help with buying a house , she said she did n't have , but gave me 1000 worth of rare plants for my new shower that died in 2 days , while my sister is on welfare with 2 kids trying to get through nursing school
1	She called to ask if I wanted perfume for xmas and I said , no , ABSOLUTELY not
1	2 days later , I got perfume
1	The year before she asked what I wanted , I said   or a drafting desk
1	So instead she gave me 800 worth of winter gear , right before my move to the desert
1	She gets ahold of business relations of mine , or old boyfriends , and accuses people of sexually harrasing me or mistreating me
1	I ca n't talk to her because she will twist my words and tell the family outlandish things like , my boyfriend is a murderer , I 'm homeless , a drug addict , you name it
1	The even crazier thing , my somewhat sane sister enjoys her and tolerates her , and even gets manipulated into believing that I 'm just over reacting and being mean to mom
1	She snaps out of it , but it has really hurt me my whole life
1	She has had Polycythemia Vera for more than 10 years , and Crohn 's disease for around the same
1	She 's got other thingsasthma , t2 diabetes , kyphosis , osteoporosis , but the top 2 or the toughest on her and most life threatening , I think
1	Last few weeks she 's swollen up so large in abdomen she looks 9 months pregnant and tummy feels just as hard
1	CT scan showed she 's filled with ascites
1	Today she had a paracentesis to relieve the pain and shortness of breath , and to diagnose the fluid
1	They did n't know why She 's still in a lot of pain and just as distended as before
1	They also gave her a sonogram
1	I have read that rarely Buddchiari syndrome has same symptoms and is linked to Polycythemia
1	I gave her Tylenol
1	So I have BPD , and it has been a struggle even just to accept my diagnosis but what I wondering is how can you tell your doctor what medicine actually works for you , mentally if you have had a suicide attempt with said medicine
1	The most productive , healthy year of my life with its own share of peaks and valleys was about ten years ago or so , and I actually can look back and point at it all being as fulfilling and satisfactory due to my taking a daily benzodiazpine for that year
1	I hit a rough patch towards the end of this time period from working two jobs and somehow trying to maintain all the other spinning plates and I ended up waking up in the hospital after getting drunk and engaging in high risk behaviors comorbidity   heavy drinking , drugs driving under the influence , if you know someone with BPD then you know what this looks like anyways , I am not trying to write a Russian novel here , I am just wondering if anyone has had any luck with telling your doctor what works for you
1	I have since stopped drinking some time ago , and yes I know the risks of mood and mind altering substances but how do you get meds that work for you , if you have n't actually ever been prescribed legally the right head medication
1	I really just recreationally tried lorazapam and it clicked , I know the risks of physical side effects , and for the whole year I took this medicine I only took one a day , never ordered those East Indian online bars where they just stack like five pills together always seemed like too much and I am not asking so it opens a drug dialogue where we compare war stories , I really was curious as to ways other people have dealt with the medicine issue when it comes to BPD
1	I need head medicine AS WELL as DBT and cognitive behavior and self help groups and everything else that can help my doctor now has n't been that keen on just listening to me tell her what she should give me , in fact having BPD has seemed to cause lots of mental health professionals to not want anything to do with the whole disorder , not just me
1	I took thorazine as prescribed one of the lowest doses for a few years , and I hate that with chemical imbalance its just a guessing game of what medicine will help
1	I stopped taking the thorazine derivative a few years ago it felt very fugue , fog like mentally but what I was wondering was what has seemed to work for other BPD 's
1	I have talked to one other BPD about this , and their advice was dialectocal
1	I got on the wait list for the only place that offers it in my area its over six months long
1	I am just at my wits end because
1	I mean , really why not just amazon myself something from Mexico , am I right
1	That was a joke , I actually would never do that , and certainly never write about it in a mental health public forum where Joe Friday could just the facts and all of a sudden I caught a RICO case   does anybody have self prescribed medicine that works
1	I guess documenting my cycles has helped but just because I can track my moon phase with my period tracker app and can better prepare myself
1	I 'm kidding I am just trying to use humor to deal with this horrible personality disorder that I would shave ten years , hell fifteen from the back end of my life if I could not be afflicted if it was a matter of me chopping off a limb , and never having to deal with all that is BPD , I would gladly offer two
1	I added a dog tax cause well he 's a two month old standard poodle puppy that my mom just got for her birthday named Sanity Sane for short and he is already sick of BPDone last thing , does anybody else find lots of stigma from telling people about your BPD diagnosis
1	I am shocked when people try and diminish it , or flat out disagree with you
1	I mean they are such similar things that 's it , mind is made up I am getting some lithium and I am going to see if that helps one last dumb joke , with my luck it would be the perfect med and I would be right back to wrestling with ordering oversea 's medicine with no FDA regulation but with Lithium you can get it over the counter I am pretty sure , it 's a type of salt if I am not mistaken
1	I would love to have some friends I could speak with since I ca nt type well and am not on the computer that much
1	But I would really like to meet some ladies with bipolar no offense guys , my hubby would n't be happy who could use a calming voice or vice versa
1	I have 1 friend , liteally , and she does n't think I 'm BP she says I do n't need all these meds and I 'm about ready not to call as often
1	We touch base daily , she 's a good person who has NO CLUE about mental health issues
1	or How do I deal with my husband who thinks BPD is a stigma and 50 of cases are not really BPD just docs wanting to make money by having you come back
1	God he 's no help , never has been and when I 'm stable I 'm going to leave
1	My family is significantly religious , and my mother in particular is very adamant about her Catholic faith and beliefs
1	I am sixteen years old now
1	I am sixteen years old now
1	Three years ago when I was in church I firmly believed I had a private revelation that I was going to be killed
1	I told this to my father and best friend , and did not talk about it excessively but when I did I delighted in the supposition that I was special
1	I mention this because , although this happened long before my actual problems , I believe this precluded a lot of it
1	a year after that in I think it was February my best friend abruptly moved out of the state
1	She has always been willingly close to me and supportive , I must admit that my relationship with her had become codependent
1	Immediately after I saw her off , I got on my knees and said a rosary , feeling as if something was changing , that I had more responsibility to my faith just because she had left
1	I was obsessed with prayer and thought God was telling me to do very trivial things such as what subject in my schoolwork I should work on , this was possible because I was homeschooling , or giving me detailed insight into the future
1	I acknowledged that these thoughts and perceived obligations were wearing me down , and slowly came to realize that thinking these things were wrong
1	I mean to point out that there were lapses in these thoughts , and at times I did believe that I was elaborating them of my own will
1	perhaps so I could have control over my life
1	it came to a point where I believed I should hurt myself in order to purge other people 's sins , something Medieval saints did , particularly the one I chose for confirmation , Saint Catherine
1	my mother and sister coaxed me out of doing these things , and I begged my mother to hide things like matches and scissors because I was scared of the inclinations to hurt myself
1	I understood that everything that had happened to me all of the above occurred over a period of approximately six months since my best friend went out of the state was completely wacko , and I pulled myself out of the delusions gradually
1	I was very sensitive at the time , could n't do schoolwork , and came back to the internet and literature things I had avoided during my period of delusional thinking because I thought them to be unholy , but in general regained my sense of reality
1	A few months after I considered myself nearly completely recovered I had panic attacks and insomnia
1	All of my symptoms matched up with General Anxiety Disorder when my mom looked it up on the internet
1	I 'd like to add that I had mild symptoms of GAD when I hit puberty , but after these six months they were noticeably severe I do still have symptoms of GAD and insomnia , but cognitive therapy has almost completely relieved onsets of panic attacks
1	my journey back into reality is something I do n't hear about much in the context of something like schizophrenia , and thought it would be important to fully explain
1	Most people with GAD struggle with the fear of having a mental disorder , and whether I have one or not is of concern
1	They told us it started coming about 5 or so years ago
1	She has completely lost touch with reality , is refusing to eat most of the time because she says the good is contaminated because her parents touched it and is losing weight rapidly becuase this
1	She has been held on a 5150 two times , after her parents were force to call the police due to her behavior , but the mental health facility she was at had to release her , because she refused to submit to blood work
1	They said they need to do blood work to prove she is not taking drugs , but to also test her for any condition that may be making her ill , ie
1	They said because she refuses this , they have to let her go after the three days
1	They have no choice but to let her come back because they do n't want her out roaming the streets
1	They 've just resigned to the fact that they are stuck and will probably watch her die , since no one is willing to help them
1	I do n't understand this , as I have never heard of having to have a mentally ill person 's permission to run blood work on them
1	Does anyone have any suggestions on what they can do to force her to get help or force the mental health facility to hold her past the three days
1	They agree that she is very sick , but say they legally can not hold her
1	She is in major denial that she is sick
1	They live in California
1	I have been denied help from both the county and the state , and unless I commit a crime , there seems to be no way out and no help
1	Allow me to tell you about myself
1	My mother first tried to murder me at the age of 5
1	I was beaten often as a child and was humiliated daily
1	When at the age of 16 I turned violent , I was made a ward of the court
1	A confrontation with a deputy sheriff on his front door step led me to be moved from the half way house I was staying at
1	Fearing I would be returned to prison and wanting to find my biological father , I came to Oregon
1	I tried to open my own business as a contractor , but an on the job fatality ruined that
1	During the time after I escaped , I was constantly paranoid , and lived in fear of going back to prison
1	I eventually passed my journey mans test and became a union carpenter
1	Six months after I passed that test , I ruined my shoulder on the job and that ended that career
1	I spent the next two years laid up trying to mend
1	The first surgery on my shoulder left me in more pain than the injury did and a constant painful tremor in my shoulder
1	After a second surgery , I was fine until I slipped and fell at a friends house and had to have a third surgery
1	The third surgery left me pretty limited in my range of motion and with another tremor although not as bad as the first
1	When I was finally released to go to work , I did not know what to do with myself
1	I eventually went to truck driving school , but had to end that career about five years later
1	While preparing to go to school , I thought I would investigate scholarships and scholarships for the disabled
1	This led me to wonder what my actual disability rating was , which led me back to my doctor
1	The doctor took some xrays of my shoulder and suggested I contact a lawyer
1	I had developed pagcl , which means that the cartilage in my shoulder had gone away
1	Unfortunately , I am ineligible for this pain pump lawsuit because I dislocated my shoulder about ten years previously
1	I am tired of living this way and tired of feeling like I am being screwed
1	Before I went to prison I wanted to join the Navy
1	When I tried to open my own business my partner who had 15 years more experience than me did something incredibly stupid and got killed
1	When I finally got my journeymans card , I got crippled up
1	When I was told that everybody but me is going to get paid very well for this bad drug , I got depressed and angry
1	Everytime I have tried to better my self and improve my station in life , I get kicked squarely in the face
1	I know that this life is supposed to be a gift , but mine is broken
1	While watching one of those ghost hunting shows , The 5 year old daughter of the homeowners told about the scary man who showed her his brains through the owie in his head
1	I want revenge , I demand retribution , but have been denied
1	The workmans compensation insurer who is handling my injury may very well deny my claim for depression and anxiety caused by the constant amount of pain I live in all the time
1	They will do anything to save them selves a buck
1	If they do deny my claim , I will be left with absolutely no resource for mental help
1	I have thought about waiting till the winter ’s cold causes the 40 mm piece of metal I had inserted in the 4th surgery on this shoulder starts hurting really bad and then taking a convenience store hostage
1	I looked up the penalty for that and it is 7 years fore the first hostage and 25 years for each additional hostage if you use a gun
1	I do not want to live this way , I do not want to hurt my self or anybody else , or spend the rest of my life in prison
1	I cut part of a finger off and broke my back twice so I am no stranger to pain , but this will never heal
1	I appreciate the beauty of the world around me and am thankful for it , but it is not enough when the pain and the tremor keep me awake , night after night
1	I am writing to you out of desperation , please help me
1	This is going to be extremely long and I am very sorry but I am getting to the point where I am ready to kill myself
1	I am currently 15 although in a few days I will be turning 16
1	The problem is I suffer from major depression and it 's taking such a toll on my life that I barely function or leave my bed at all
1	I barely get up to urinate , sometimes I go a day or two without a shower and I never brush my hair
1	Leaving the house never happens unless it 's to go to therapy and sometimes I even skip therapy sessions because I honestly do n't care
1	I do n't want to get better , I do n't see the point in it
1	Before I go into detail of why I do n't care I wish to explain a little more of my current situation
1	I am the youngest child and the preferred of my mother
1	A lot of people would say OH YOU ARE HER BABY OF COURSE YOU ARE No that is not the reason or at least not all of it
1	My father is a very strong narcissist with a very big ego and my mother is a sheltered loner who has no friends
1	The only person in her life is my father who she has tried and keeps trying to ruin so he will come back to her
1	He is her life and I am her favorite because I am the only child she has had with him
1	She was in abusive relationship with the father of my older siblings and has always put me or my father over them
1	This is bad because not only did it strain their relationship with hers it strained the one I have with them
1	My father did awful things to one of my siblings and my mother actually told them to the police they were lying so my father would not end up in jail
1	She also bullied my other one for looking just like their father
1	I was too young to know any of this and did n't find out till YEARS later so for a long time I looked up to my father
1	My mother sheltered me and my father gave me affection , seeing as my mother is n't good with people
1	Thus I grew close to my father and was very bonded to him for a long time
1	However he moved because they wanted to live in different cities but were still together
1	At this time I saw him a few times a month
1	A few years later me and my mother move back to my hometown
1	Just me and her
1	She suddenly rips up photos of him one day and tells me he does n't love me and that I have to hate him
1	I was also being bullied and had began to learn how to make friends because in the other town I had none
1	I started to see him less and she would have times where she loved him and times where she hated him
1	She also tried to hang herself and because she sheltered me so much I did n't know what she was doing but I had a bad feeling so I stopped her
1	She ended up driving him away for a year and told me every single bad thing about him that she knew
1	This in turn has caused me to suffer from problems such as being too possessive over people because of my fear of them leaving me or not loving me
1	I have turned very manipulative like her and will make threats so my friends feel like they ca n't leaveI do not mean them and sometimes I do make them as a joke
1	After finding out about these things my father did and after all the bullying I became depressed
1	But as I started 8th grade I made less friends and did less things
1	Around the end of the year in last year I could n't take it anymore and stopped going to school
1	I stopped talking to friends and I started sleeping all day and being awake most of the night
1	Around this time I also noticed that I did n't care about my life anymore
1	I noticed that I do n't add anything important to this world and I could easily be replaced by someone pretty and smart
1	I 've accepted that I do n't matter and that I am truly not going to get better and that 's ok
1	I do n't see the point in living for the good moments if I only have one and live surrounded in bad
1	I am just like my mother and as much as I would n't mind having a relationship I am too scared of being manipulative because I have turned this way and I do n't think it can change
1	I do n't know what to do though because I am scared of pain even things like needles or being pinched
1	I can deal with nausea pretty well though so I have been thinking of that
1	Maybe you 'll think if you do nt care why did you write this
1	I do n't know really , if I get help that s fine but if I do nt that s fine too
1	Yes I go to therapy and I take medication and I have home therapy No I do n't have friends or people I ca nt talk to most of the time since my friends are online and they have different time zones and they have better friends to worry about
1	They even think I fake this or that its not a big deal even though they themselves go through similar things
1	I hope I do n't sound snippy or mean i 'm just really tired of everything
1	i ve been having constant mood swings , sometimes i m happy , and sometimes i do nt want to be living anymore
1	everything i have been doing lately i have had a guilt feeling towards it
1	sometimes i ve wanted to scream but instead i burst out into tears
1	I ve found myself crying alot lately , feeling   about myself i ve often had suicidal thoughts , i know for a fact i would never do it , but i ca nt help but think my friends have not been the best of people to have around , one friend imparticular she always causes me to get angry and i just think and wished she were dead
1	i have nt been out much lately , only to school and back , i always used to go out but since i ve had this feeling i ve been overly tierd and feeling sick all the time
1	i just do nt seem to be myself anymore , i always feel sad
1	i ve been applying for saturday jobs , one day i have it all planned out and i m really excited , the next day when i rang up i was still happy , i got offered a place to work so i told them i d call back asap , but as soon as i put the phone down i felt useless for some reason , i felt pathetic and i called back and declined the job
1	i really want to be my old self again but i feel asif i ca nt do it where i live now , i want to get away but i ca nt , my options came through , and i know if i move anywhere else i would nt get a chance half as good as this i told my mum yesturday and asked if it was depression , she said it was all in my mind i have a perfect life and nothing could be wrong , but i know for a fact it is nt in my mind
1	I am 17 years old , female , and a junior in HighSchool
1	I 've been struggling with depression for a few years , but recently it 's gotten unmanageable
1	I have now developed severe anxiety and I am missing a lot of school
1	All my friends have stopped texting me and even stopped responding when I text them
1	My best friend told me he wants nothing to do with me
1	I have a brother the same age as me and a 14 year old sister that both go to my HighSchool
1	It 's so hard to be the way I am and watch them live amazing and happy lives
1	I cry myself to sleep every night
1	I try to go to social events , but I can never make any friends that want to talk to me outside of that event or school
1	I 'm so depressed I 'm becoming physically I 'll and I do n't know what to do
1	I love meeting new people , they just never stick around
1	I ca n't even fathom moving out of state for my college degree next year
1	I 'm releaved to know that the freefloating cyst in my scrotum is benign , but the cost of removeal seems extremely high
1	My details Late in 2005 I noticed a small nodule within my scrotum , not within the skin or on the testes , apparently not attached to anything
1	On followup Jan ' 08 , a different doctor another urologist would not say what he thought it was indicating that he rarely sees a freefloating nodule with the scrotum
1	Two weeks ago I went in for outpatient surgery
1	My total time at the hospital was about 25 hours
1	I was able to walk out with no pain , having just a few stitches in my scrotum
1	The nodule appeared clear , and yesterday I got the lab report back confirming that it was a benign cyst , possibly an early hydrocele , although I thought a hydrocele was fluid around a testical not a nodule seperate and distinct from the testical
1	But here 's the thing   The cost was 9362 and I 'm not sure if this is the entire cost
1	Hospital paperwork 3 clerical hours at 100h Nursing support , including preop preps 6 nursing hours at 100h Surgery 2 doctor hours at 300h to account for travel time and file review , although I 'm sure he was scheduled for other work while there
1	Operating Room Cleanup 1 hour support staff at 50h Waste disposal 200 Lab work to ID cyst 500 I get 2,750 being liberal with the costs and times
1	I have no problem with the staff the nurses and doctor were great , but the system is broken when a 20 minute cyst removal , involving local anesthesia can take a year 's salary for someone on minimum wage
1	And what happens to that low wage uninsured guy who has a serious problem like some of you on this forum and he fails to get it diagnosed much less cured because of cost
1	My guess   he dies
1	Hey so I 'm 23 havnt had the best of lives there was a lot abuse from a very young I was a silent child I would read books and climb trees and hide I got on with my school work rarely interacted with the other school kids could only have one friend stupidly gullible stupidly emotional up until 13 when my whole world shook up over night I all of a sudden had a voice and a very spiteful tongue I hated everyone except my bestfriend at the time we were inseparable anyone that tried to get between us I hated and tried chasing off I hated the thought of settling down I fell pregnant at 15 I kept my baby as much as everyone said get rid she 's now 7 and the best thing that 's ever happened to me things carried on being crap but she kept me going I got into a fight and eneded up with alot of internal damage and was told I would never have anymore kids I was already on a downward spiral and ended up kind of seeing someone he was a very well dressed drug addict I did n't know until I caught him when I was 6 weeks pregnant I left with my daughter and moved away for a few months then ended up in a relationship with a friend just over 4 years later were still together but even though he knows everything about me he never seems to understand stand me or how things work in my head iv had various different diagnosises and 8 months ago I was diagnosed with bpd it hit me like a ton of bricks I was scared confused but it made sense I started to understand myself tried to get everyone to understand including my partner but he wo nt take in the fact that I 'm ill and it really effects my life the paranoia drives me crazy I do n't know who to trust it feels like everyone is against me nearly all the time o bottle up pretty much all my feelings so I do n't hurt anyone but then it all comes out my family kind of understand but his family ignore it because I do n't have a runny nose etc how do I get them to understand I now have three children I really struggle with the younger two sometimes I wish I did n't have them and that they are an inconvenience but most of the time I love them I do n't understand I did n't have this with my first child I one friend I can talk to that does n't take the   and I have another friend who just uses me as a baby sitter because I do n't go out much because of the social phobia there 's a lot going on there and I 'm really close to getting really angry with her iv spoken to my partner and my other friend and they have seen how angry I 'm getting about the whole situation but I just ca nt talk to her I do nt even know why I really want to work but my partner wo nt let me in case I wander off even to the point of refusing to look after the kids for me saying he 's got things to do or telling me he will pay me the same amount to stay at home if I 'm out longer than 20 min on my own and I do n't answer my phone he phones people to find out where I am if no one knows then he phones the police and they start looking for me because he rubs on the vulnerable adult thing really thick it drives me nuts yet his family say my track record does nt help because I go for walks alone for an hour or two to clear my head before I snap I see it as safer that way I 'm really quite in tune with myself so I know when things are going wrong and I try to stop it sometimes I fail but I 'm working on it I feel like I 'm being treated like a child I wish i was n't like this I hate it and I hate my life I feel soo trapped and permanently judged and do n't know what to do
1	I am told by my husband that being stepmom to his 7 year old ‘ is what I make it’ in other words , if I want to consider him my own … then he is my own
1	That ’s all great until husband disagrees with me … for example , I wanted to punish the kid over breaking an electronic … a 5 minute time out is what I was asking for
1	So he kindly reminded me that he does in fact have the final say
1	He wants me to act like the ‘ bio parent’ as long as it his way and he is in agreement
1	Then he ’s worried about when we have kids
1	He was a single parent for a few years with 100 custody … its been 5050 now for a year
1	He ’s not used to consulting anyone but for god sakes I am in a no win situation
1	I give and give and then I ca nt get mad or frustrated when he breaks something of mine
1	I guess may be this is where I , I am not sure , I have a long history of psych illness , obvious BPD , bipolar recently became apparent , but I have serious health problems
1	But due to my psych history no one takes me seriouusly
1	I am a RN as well
1	I studied too go to Medical School but never made it as physically I m just so sick and tired of being sick and tired , literally
1	Yes , people listen to me , but they do not hear me
1	I am in the health field and have obvious health problems but by now , now that psychologically I m stable , my family and many friends have turned their backs
1	I posted here because when I finally became so sick that I can not leave my house anymore , my cell phone broke bad luck I know and I was a victim of identity fraud so my debit card is out for a week , the internet is my only source of communication
1	The realization hit me when I saw the truth
1	No one responded to my desperate pleas for a diagnosis , although I medically responded to theirs
1	They stuck to their own , cliques , they had already formed friends
1	The doctors appear arrogant thus far and have ignorred my posts as well , skipping over them , just as the doctor in the ER refused to treat meeven with sysmtoms similar to spinal cord injury my diagnosis and symptoms range from lymphoma to multiple sclerosis and definitely involve my cervical spine as I have been diagnosed witth fibromyalgia , lupus , cervical kyphosis , and the list goes onI think its just one condition
1	I am scared , or rather sad , very saddened by the fact that I may in fact die because people just do n't care
1	I used to have dreams of changeing the world , but I realize I am powerless
1	I just find it so sad and so irronic that the very people I was trying to help , my all time goal and dream of loving and caring for others and making a difference , those people wo n't help me , so I in turn might not physically be around to help them
1	I wanted to make a difference , and I know in a small way to some I have , but in the long run , I was n't given equipment I needed to make the big enough difference in this world that I wanted
1	If anyone has gone through something similar , getting people to take them seriously even though you have a psych diagnosis , anything would hlelp
1	I have much going on in my life that has caused me great pain and suffering but right now I want to focus on a situation with my mom
1	I was injured in May of this year by a man that I had only been dating a short while
1	He seemed like the man of my dreams when I first met him but he quickly turned extremely jealous possesive obsessive and all the rest
1	I had broke things off with him just after Easter and had not seen him in 6 weeks when he came to my home
1	Needless to say he abused me and left me with a broken back and a complete loss of a good quality of life for the time being
1	I do n't want to get into that too much right now but this man , who had never been in trouble with the law is now sitting in jail awaiting trial which will be taking place later this year
1	Unfortunatlly , he will probably be out long before I am healed and that is a huge unjustice
1	First , I do n't want to rewrite my whole history with my mom but I have posted several comments with Zoidal if you want to read them and get a better idea of my problem
1	So now after not seeing or speaking to my mom in almost 2 months she has called me for help
1	What i neglected to mention in my prior comments is that my mom is a binge alcoholic , which means she does n't drink all the time , in fact she goes months and has even gone a few years without a drop , but when she starts she ca n't stop for sometimes days or weeks
1	That was the case when she left me in the hospital and that is part of what devasted me so much
1	So now she has checked herself into a temporary rehab center but can only stay for ten days and then she has to leave and wait to get into a center that will help her for 30 days or longer depending on how long they figure she needs
1	I am proud of her for that and hope that she is able to overcome this illness once and for all
1	The thing is that she is now asking A for me to come down to the place she is at now , to bring her cigarettes and toiletries etc , but I am in a wheelchair for the time being and ca n't just jump into a vehicle to come to her aide and B she wants to stay in my home while she waits to get into the second rehab center
1	The problem there is that I will be leaving for a few weeks to spend time with one of my daughters and I do n't trust leaving my mom here alone
1	She would never steal anything but my worry is that she will get lonely and end up turning to the bottle and perhaps letting strange people into my house
1	She did this while I was in the hospital and I had to get friends to go to my house after she left and clean up and get my keys that my mom had left in the mail box
1	Also , even if I was n't leaving and she stayed here with me , I would be afraid that if a disagreement happened between her and I she would start drinking again and it would be my fault
1	I feel that letting her into my home is only setting us both up for failure
1	I know that she is trying , but at the same time I do n't think she is far enough into treatment that she is well enough not to slide off the wagon
1	and I am afraid that I will just end up some how being the bad guy again
1	Sort of a damned if you do and damned if you do n't situation
1	As for me going down to the place she is at now to bring her items , I could probably get someone to do it for me , but my friends do so much for me now as it is , that I do n't want to have them to do anything extra for me
1	And if truth be known my closest friends know what she s done in the past and I do n't think they would think it was a very good idea and probably would n't want to do it
1	I want to be there for her in her time of need , the problem is I am personally still in a time of need and am really not physically or mentally strong enough to help
1	Hey , I am worried that I might be pregnant
1	I got my first ever depo shot around March 9th of this year , it 's now April 14th , a little more than a month after my shot and I am experiencing pregnancy symptoms as described below
1	  slightly more visible blue veins in my breasts , lower arms , hands , and upper chest above my breasts
1	Just in these past few days I 've felt fatigued , my appetite has increased a lot , swollen breasts , i feel bloated , a little dizzy , and moody
1	I am overweight , polycystic ovarian disease , never had regular period in my life , on my first time ever depo shot,19 , and extremely scared
1	On an added note , I had unprotected sex 6 days after my first shot and have had unprotected sex a few times since then
1	Also , I was put on the diet pill Phentermine the same day I was put on depo and I have recently within the past 7 days gone off Phentermine due to irritability , aggression , and mood swings
1	I do n't know what to think of all of this and I feel as if I 'm going crazy
1	My brother was diagnosed with lung cancer during a routine check up as such he did not have any symptoms
1	In September 2013 his Ca 199 was24403 and serum CEA was 495His Pet scan showed a mass ase of metastatic adenocarcinoma involving liver leison
1	He was given four chemo cyles of GEMox His PET scan in November 2013 was unchanged CA 199 increased to 43537 He was given three cycles of Chemo CAPIRIToday he has undergone the tests CA 199 has slightly reduced to 42869 and Serum CEA has gone up to 6979
1	His PET scan says FDG avid large illdefined necrotic mass lesion is noted in the liver 123 x 115 cms , SUV max 1915
1	I have a question this year has been horrible for me and my husband
1	It started in March when my husband got his foot ran over by a trash truck
1	Which fractured two of his two bones and the doctor has now said there is nothing they can do about this
1	He will live in severe chronic pain for the rest of his life
1	During this whole time I started having women problems which come to find out was a on my ovary that had gotten lodged in my pelvic cavity and my endometriosis went bad
1	I had a simple laproscopic procedure done which during the process they had nicked the intestines and they did not know about it
1	Needles to say I was not healing from the surgery and went back into the hospital after 8 days they finally figured out what was wrong , but by then I had abcecces from my bowels to my lungs
1	Which caused me to be septic and required a laportomy which is when they open you form sternum to pelvic bone
1	Which I did thankfully and was in the hospital for a month
1	They had also given me a colosomy bag to help the intestines heal which is wear you poop in a bag on the outside of your stomach
1	They reversed that thankfull in Nov after another major surgery
1	The question is I know have extreme symptoms of stress which I have been put on an antidepressent for
1	But my family expects me to be back to normal after everything is healed
1	The question is if anyone has any words of wisdom every thing stresses me out even normal day to day activities
1	Which is easy when you have a two year old and a six year old
1	I am trying to help them get over all of this and everyday is a constatnt struggle and nobody understands
1	I also work for my mom which is good , but then you have no one to talk to about your boss if she is your boss
1	My husband just found out bad news on his foot again and I do not know how much more we can take this year
1	I am physically well and want to be able to help my husband emotionally
1	I just want to be my old self
1	Hi all , I posted a while back because I had been tolerating my husband 's anger and verbal abuse for so long , that I lost my self esteem and began to believe everything was my fault
1	I finally found my spine and stood up to him and we both have began individual counseling
1	I am still learning how to be assertive and he now regards me as too dangerous to deal with so now he does n't interact with me at all
1	For now , I 'm okay with this , but I recently purchased a book The Verbally Abusive Spouse Can He Change
1	and had it sitting under a pile of papers that I 'd set in the entry way when I got home from errands this afternoon
1	After he got home from work , I remembered the book , and I went to relocate it
1	When I asked him if he did , he denied seeing it or moving it
1	I know he has it , and he has hid it because he feels threatened by it
1	Part of me hopes he reads it and gets some feedback from it about his behavior , and the other part of me is furious that he has taken it
1	I 've confronted him once and he 's lied
1	Do I call him on the carpet for lying and demand my book back   he will tell me I have a crppy memory , and that he has no idea what I 'm talking about or do I just let this one go
1	At this point he is making some really dumb choices if he thinks attempting to control my thinking is going to help mattersMM
1	right anyway , the situation i m in is really depressing me at the minute
1	There is this lad in my year , noone would expect him to be bisexual but i know that he is , he asks me to do things on webcam for him and even rang me one night and started talking dirty , he s the basic lad , plays all sports , one of the big hard ones in the year and always flirty with the girls
1	I think about him all the time , more or less every minute of every day i think about him , i have had a bad past with him , he 's been a bully to me and all sorts , i recently told a close friend about how i feel towards him and what he says to me and she thinks that he s only done the bullying in the past to hide his sexuality but really she thinks he has feelings for me , yet he is still a really bad knobhead with me , excuse my language , but i ca n't cope anymore , i really want to get over him but i ca n't , then again i really want to take this a step further and do something with him , some help please
1	I think I may know what is wrong with me now
1	For the past year since I had a boyfriend I seem to have all these physical sensations
1	I feel like that is what is going on in my brain , flickering off and on , then I get really freaked out
1	It seems like every since I met my boyfriend this has gotten worse
1	I have never obsessed about depression symptoms before I met him
1	Now I just notice every sensation in my body , I ca nt get my mind off of it
1	Me and my boyfriend always go on nice outings like to the mountains , beach , nice restaurants , but I can never enjoy it because of these physical sensations
1	I have never had this problem so severe before I met him him
1	I have had depression symptoms before but I never obsessed about it before , only this past year
1	I am with someone who is destroying me completely
1	He is a very overpowering man and has within the 1 year of us being together totally taken control over me
1	He swears at me for anything little thing i do ie accidently putting butter on his toast or not giving him the right towel , he tells me that i am a sla and whor and that no one would ever have me because of the realtionships i have had in the past and that i am stupid , he is always using his strength to take control of the argument and by this i mean grabbing me by the throat or holding me up against the wall , but he says he is not silly to mark my face as he would nt want others to know
1	I want to lieave him desperately but he has nt threatned to hurt my mum and grandmother who live alone if i do because they kept things about me from him rightly so in the past
1	I tried to run away last year and he smashed there house windows and threatned my mum but police did nothing as there was no evidence , he is too clever for that
1	I hate being with him and scared of everything i do incase its going to upset him
1	He does nt allow me to go out or to socialise anymore or even to have a drink at home now i am being classed as a alcoholic , i hardly drink
1	I have contemplated suicide because of the pain i go through , waking up in the morning and being sworn at so much becuase of something minor and having to wipe my tears and go to work with a brave face
1	I stay with him because of the fear of what my poor parents will have to go through if I leave and i do nt think its fair as they do nt deserve this
1	Hi , I posted the following on the Heart rhythm forum but after talking to someone who knows my home situation , she suggested it could be stress related
1	Brief history , up until a year ago when my wife was diagnosed with Delusional problems , for the 5 years previous she accused me of having affairs unfounded , I have n't cheated on her in 34 years , controlled now with medication , however , she is now suffering with depression   anxiety and for the past year she has become more and more withdrawn
1	I have been told by my GP on two occasions that I was showing symptoms of classic stress , heavy nose bleeds for a few days , stomach pains etc
1	Early December last year I was told that I have Hypercholesterolaemia and I would have to take Simvastatin 40 mg and quit smoking , I 'm male and almost 52 yrs old
1	I went on Champix to quit and I have n't smoked for 12 weeks and have now finished the Champix , what concerns me now is my BP has always been slightly low , 125   75 and my HR around 70 , now for the last month my HR has dropped to between 55 to 65 , I been getting some dizzyness , feel washed out and have some mild chest discomfort , my GP is sending me for an ECG
1	He also told me that nicotine speeds up the HR and so smoking could have masked a problem for years , has anyone got any advice as to what the future holds and what the treatment could be
1	Also since posting the above , for the past few days now I 've felt all jittery , weak and slightly shaky , like when you 've just vomitted
1	I have been a single mom for 24 years working many hours to raise my 2 fantastic kids
1	He started developing schizophrenia when he was 17 yet did n't show full signs of it until he has 23 in which case I was confused   had no idea what was happening
1	He moved back home with me
1	Thankfully he has now been on proper medication for 2 years
1	His symptom 's seldom occur yet I know he is still dealing with them
1	He is not comfortable going out   has removed all his friends
1	I have had to try to clean his living areas with shovel as it is such a mess   been destroyed
1	I am the only person he has to lean on besides his sister who does n't live near
1	I often feel I am not dealing with his medication symptom 's properly   do not have enough patience
1	As with anyone suffering this illness he does not deserve to go thru this he is a wonderful person who 's life has changed
1	If there is anything I can do to help him as I have no support please let me know
1	I 'm a 60yr old female who has never been on my own
1	I 'm dependant on my husband for my support and most importantly health insurance
1	We have 2 businesses that are not finacially stable and I do the bookwork for both companies
1	I 'm intelligent but not proficent in anything typing , bookkeeping or computers With the job market and housing sales down I do n't know where to get help to support myself
1	My husbands abuse verbal is getting worse all the time because I ' ca n't do as much as I use to
1	My son moved 2000 miles away to work because here in Mich are business is so up and down could n't support his familyDaughter is in her own world and has her own issues
1	My husband dosen't know anything about the paperwork or bookkeeping involved in our business always has someone else take care of everything which has cost alot of money over the yrs
1	Quit smoking 17 years ago cold turkey my daughter was about to be born
1	For the past few months , I have been trying to get to the bottom of what has been ailing me
1	First I thought that I had colon cancer , which made for a very stressful December when 2 out of 3 occult blood tests were positive for blood
1	After the colonoscopy result came back as normal , I was very relieved and thought I was out of the woods
1	But around that same time I started feeling dizzy every day , as well as a slight tremor in my hands
1	I would wake up feeling like I had a couple of beers and this feeling would last all day
1	The shakiness reminds me of when my blood sugar would be low
1	I am not diabetic , but it has happened once or twice in my life
1	I thought that this symptom was probably a post traumatic sideeffect from all of the stress I put myself through thinking I was going to die for a month straight
1	I had my brain scanned which was ordered by my neurologist
1	Then I I thought there was Cancer in my femur because of deep pain I was feeling there
1	Since about mid February , I noticed that I had a dull ache in the left side of my back , about half way up
1	At that time I started reading about this complaint online bad idea and started to panic because of some similarities in the whole catalog of symptoms I was experiencing at the time
1	I noticed that my stools were lighter than normal , and tended to float more often than not
1	I would say my stools were roughly the same color as peanut butter good luck eating that nowsomewhere between yellow and brownalmost an orangebrown
1	I started to look more closely at my stools in the toilet and noticed that there is a clear film of what looks like oil on the surface
1	I went back to the same Gastro that handled my colonoscopy back in December , and advised him of my concerns
1	He ordered another round of blood work previously also done in November
1	He ordered a CBC , Metabolic panel , Amylase , Lipase , Hepatic panel , CA19 , and a few others
1	At that time he also ordered a Fecal Fat test Quantitative   1 sample and it came back as increased , which basically meansYes , there 's fat in your stool
1	He ordered a Pancreatic protocal CT scan with and without contrast
1	Around this time I started to develop a weird metallic taste in my mouth
1	Concerned about malabsorption , he ordered a blood test to check for fat soluble vitamins A , E , D , B12I do n't think he checked K Anyway , everything was ok except for vitamin D which was a little below the lowlevel254
1	It has been a long winter here in the northeast and perhaps that is why my level is a tad low
1	He found a mild case of duodenitis and prescribed Nexium
1	Since a couple of weeks ago , I have noticed the upper abdominal pain even more and feel the connection between my front and back as almost one in the same
1	Pain sometimes goes around the side too , and it seems like my left shoulder is now involved
1	So my concern is , is it possible for the CT scan to miss something
1	My impression is that if you have pain that is coming from something sinister within your pancreas , it would certainly be large enough to be detected on a CT scan designed to look at the pancreas
1	I feel a lot more fatigued over the past couple of weeks
1	The Bad • Lighter stools sometimes they float and other times they sink all the way down • Persistent oil film on surface
1	• Metallic taste I have no idea why , but have read some pretty alarming causes for this • Dizzy   buzzed feeling • Tired a lot • Serious anxiety • Depression • Obsessed about what is wrong with me
1	I wish I was confident too Just wanted to get some thoughts on what I might be looking forward to
1	I made way too many mistakes in my life
1	My story is too long to tell so here is a breif point by point list of what is and has been going on in my life   all started with me hating the way i looked even tho i m pretty and my sister always got the attention because she was the star singer of the family and she has learning disabilites , and then there s me the oldest and I have to figure out everything for myself
1	then out of curiousity I strip for girls too , so I became bicurious
1	I craved all this positve feedback , such as your sexy , ect
1	and unfortunately it became an addiction because I felt great about myself and I was getting all this attention
1	  then I open a paypal account and make videos of myself doing provacative things and selling them and making money
1	  my friends find out when I push a little farther and advertise myself on myspace , so they tell my parents because they 're worried about me   biggest mistake of my life I   my best friends boyfriend out of peer pressure , she kept him and dumped me , because she does n't believe me because I am quote on quote   so therefore peer pressure of sex should not be an issue for me
1	I cried for days and my best friend made me miserable and her and her boyfriend picked on me for a while while she still tried to stay friends with me i understand she was hurt , but I was sick of it and I told her I did n't want to be friends with her and that it would not work out
1	  because I 'm so addicted to this   buisness , my so called friend professional model decided he 'd help me get a headstart with the porn industry
1	I gave my trust to him and sent him my best video I never sent anyone who personaly knew me or lived near me them he decides to send them to people and it gets around the school great
1	I 'm already the school , just starting to loose my repuation and karma comes back and bites me
1	  so my best friend apologized to me and we did n't resolve the issue but we 're on a talking level now
1	i hope you die
1	i 'll see you in class   just do nt get in my way and hopefully we can get through this year with no problems if you could i would appreciate if you switched out cause everytime i look at you i wanna puke and it really bugs me cause i just wanna learn
1	oh and a while back i saw bicurious on your myspace
1	you ever are or you are nt bi
1	you do nt tell people that your curious you just   do it you
1	you just do it for attention you would nt eat a chicks   and you know it and if you have i feel sorry for that girl she probably got herpes from you sucking so much
1	but yea i thought i would be a little more polite and say this on the computer rather than in person to save you some embaressment
1	too much competition do nt worry she has a shitload of acne so at least you do nt have that
1	and if you have a problem with this please do tell me
1	i m really interested in what you have to say
1	  i never replyed to any of the messages and on top of all this i believe I may have some kind of std or infection , and I have also broken out into a million red spots all over my torso and back   so I cried my eyes out , two nights ago , woke up my eyes were swollen so much more has happened , like the little things , this is only half of what is going on in my life
1	I ca n't go to my parents about any of this
1	they support me but hardly anything
1	I hate my life , I do n't want to die , but I 've had suicide thoughts and in my mind I think about what I should write on my suicide paper
1	I cry and have a break down at least once a week , and I hide it from the world and do it in private so my parents ca n't ask me what is wrong
1	My mom is going through menopause , so I have to deal with her bitching
1	I have gotten more violent with my sister when we fight , I actually punch her in the face now
1	Sometimes I scream on the spot until I can hardly breathe and my face goes all red , and I ca n't talk anymore because my throat got too dry
1	and i m crying as i type this and i dunt kno wat to do
1	I not sure if this is the right place for this , but I think it fits best
1	Basically very often I feel like I 'm disconnected
1	I have no idea how to truly explain this but I will try as best I can
1	Often I feel like I 'm constantly disassociated withwell reality I guess
1	I move from being on my computer to playing an instrument and then walking around the house only to return to my room , feeling like I 'm trapped
1	I can just blank out for what seems like hours only to find it has been mere minutes
1	I feel like I experience time dilation
1	Lately I just feel so apathetic or just that nothing matters , as if politics could not even ever matter to me , because they can not effect my life
1	Sometimes I just sit indian style and lean forward onto the ground and just lie like that for days in my head , only for really an hour or so
1	I do n't know how to explain what exactly it is that I 'm feeling
1	I 'd appreciate all of your opinionsperspectives
1	Then , I 'll discuss my insecurities
1	I am trying to figure out if I did something wrong in my relationship with heror if the only thing wrong was really her potential BPD
1	We dated for about two months , and the relationship was a definite emotional rollercoaster
1	I 'm in my late twenties , and she 's a little younger than I am
1	She 's been in longer term relationships , which I thought was a positive thing in that she could teach me a thing or two about being in longer term relationships
1	There were a number of red flags looking back , and looking back one of them is that she seems to swing from one relationship to the next , and usually back and forth , keeping at least two guys interested at once as far as I 've seenmore about that later
1	When we first started dating , she continued to be friends with a guy who she dated as a rebound from her most recent ex
1	He still wanted to be with her , and I thought it was mean for her to continue to be friends with him
1	She said that because they shared the same interests she wanted to remain friends
1	I fell for her hard
1	I 'm a new therapist , and she seemed to be very in touch with her feelings and good at articulating herself emotionally
1	Another potential red flag is that I felt pressure from her to have sex soon after we started seeing each othe
1	I did n't want to since I 've had short flings and wanted to take this slow
1	She started to cry and said she felt like i did n't like her
1	I was nervous , but the relationship progressed quickly because i either felt like i had to go at her pace or the whole thing might end
1	The sex was amazing , and I felt close to her
1	She made me feel like I could do anything I wanted with her sexually , and she was very uninhibited about sex
1	She was also very directive about sex , at times telling me exactly what she wanted
1	This is not the way I am at all , and was a little uncomfortable for me , but I appreciated her honesty
1	She did get angry when I did n't please her sexually , and she thought it was n't fair for me to stop after I was done
1	This is an example of an area in which I recognize I was wrong and corrected my behavior
1	I have been single for most of my life , and so I recognize I 'm out of practice with relationships
1	Whenever I tried to express my own opinion on what I thought we might dooffer alternatives , or if I could n't see her for some reason , the response she gave me was that maybe I could n't satisfy her needs or did n't know what a relationship should be like and we should n't date
1	Because i wanted to be with her , I tried to give her what she wanted
1	At the same time , I did n't want to feel like i was walking on eggshells all the time , But the reality was i was nervous stating my opinion around her because of the effect it might have if her opinion was different
1	She made me feel like there was something wrong with me , and that I should have swallowed my pride and do what she wanted to do
1	I think I can be stubborn and I enjoy things happening my way
1	Often , I 'll offer alternatives ie , we could go to this other place for dinner which she interpreted as me trying to do things my way
1	I explained I was just trying to be helpful , but she felt like she had to fight me to get things her way
1	I wanted to be able to tell her my opinion about things , and then I would be happy to do what she wanted to do or to compromise , but I did n't like feeling like I had done something wrong for offering my opinion
1	She did give me the impression that she wanted me to be honest with her if something was bothering her
1	Once , she asked me if something was bothering me during lunch , and I said no even though something was bothering me
1	After I admitted something was wrong , she got angry at me for lying to her
1	Ten minutes later , I finally got to tell her what was on my mind
1	She also got angry at me for asking her to repeat something she said during the same conversation
1	When I later told her she might have to repeat herself around me sometimes , she said alright begrudgingly , but said I was n't looking at her when she was talking , which was not ok with her
1	This is an example of how she would spin her actions back on something I had done wrong
1	Sometimes , if I thought she had done something wrong , she would say you 're right , you 're a better person that I am , I 'm a bad person
1	Another red flag a couple of weeks in , I noticed we were hanging out or together all of the time
1	I told her that due to my busy schedule , I need time to be alone especially after very long , busy , and draining days
1	At the time , she understood that in order for me to be fully present with her I need time to be alone , but did not want to set up boundaries about what days of the week we might hang out
1	Then , less than a week later , she got very upset when I did not respond to her texts in which she stated she missed me by wanting to hang out with her even though she had said she understood that I was busy a little while earliershe had been free that whole day , and I had been busy
1	She said me asking for space was me trying to control the relationship , and I started to think she might be right
1	She said me asking to not hang out all of the time reminded her of her ex
1	I now wonder if I was too forceful in asking for space
1	I got the sense from her that she was afraid to spend any time alone , but she would never own this , and turned it into my problem of wanting too much space
1	Being afraid of intimacy is indeed something that 's pretty real for meI told her I was afraid of getting hurt , so she hit on another insecurity of mine
1	The above illustrates how I never knew when she was going to get upset , and so when we were n't together I was nervous about what might happen if I did n't see her before she wanted to see me
1	I hung out with her more than I might otherwise like because I was afraid she might get upset
1	Even though she might have said to me that it 's ok if we do n't hang out tonight , the reality was that if we did n't , it was pretty likely she would send a mean message to me late at night saying something like i 'm angry at you
1	i want to text you but i 'm afraid to because i do n't want you to think i 'm clingy
1	you put us in a bad situation and i do n't like it
1	i ve been trying 4times now but all i got is a menstruation to be honest its really killing me inside i do nt know what s wrong anymore month of june i was 2weeks delayed month of july my period did nt come so i got high hopes then just yesterday i bled i almost gave up i do nt want to rely on any applications anymore regarding how to know when u are fertile i do nt know my cycle anymore i also thought of taking a birth control pills and suddenly stop drinking maybe that would help but i remember my 2 cousins took that before the one was drinking and stop and drinjk and stop and drink and stop but never get pregnant and the other one was almost a year since she stop before she gets her 2nd baby we always make love monthly to the days when i thought i m fertile to be honest i also have another bf yeah i m having sex with my 2 bf 's is nt is so depressing to know that u ca nt bear a baby still
1	i just want to cry i want to forget as a woman this pregnansy thing is very important i do nt know who s got the problem anymore judge me if u want i do nt care i m just sharing my heart aches because i want to hurt myself already like i want to do something stupid WHY
1	my life is very complicated i ca nt go to doctor ok just some private matters thanx for all who read this
1	I start to feel almost bored and restless at around 6 pm and I feel like there is nothing to do and nothing excites me
1	For example , I think of the weekend and it just makes me feel like it 's not worth it and I will not enjoy anything ever again
1	This then leads me to otherthink and worry and stress which makes my heart rate faster and increases my panicking
1	I guess I do n't really feel sad , I just kind of feel nothingness , but that then makes me feel sad
1	I feel dreamy and almost like I 'm not really awake   experiencing my day normally
1	I do n't feel any dizziness or sickness or anything healthwise so people could say it 's harmless , but the way it makes me feel is awful and isolated , as though no one can understand or take it away
1	I feel like I have lost control of my thoughts which terrifies me
1	Also scarily I 'm only 14 which is uncommon , so I do n't want anything bad to be starting because I just want to enjoy my life again normally like everyone else and every other normal teenager
1	Note , I got a case of flu around New Years time and it started out as medical symptoms obviously sore throat , cough , blocked nose , etc and on the first day of it I woke up with the dreaming sensation
1	I could n't focus and at one point I could n't even tell what was real
1	I 've cried almost every night since New Years as I get so upset and scared and terrified of this
1	I am an over thinker but I 've never had this strange feeling deep inside me
1	I went through a week of missing school only because of the actual ' ill ' part , and as I went back to school I noticed i started the weird feelings so perhaps I feel as though going from the busy school routine to doing nothing at home makes me weird
1	I do n't even know , I 've tried my hardest to explain it but I ca n't seem to really word it out
1	I just wanted to state how I feel in the hope someone will recognise or relate to it as I 've never felt more trapped , alone , or empty in my life
1	Thanks , Vanessa Ps I have never been diagnosed or considered having Depression or anxiety   I am usually a healthy and happy person
1	It 's been a short while since I 've posted a question , sorry for the burden , but I 'm not sure what to do anymore
1	I have been working with my counselor to straighten out and fix my PTSD and self esteem issues
1	They have gotten better and I do n't struggle as bad
1	I also have n't self harmed in almost a month
1	Everything has been looking up but through these past 2 weeks alone all of the sudden school and daily things are taking the place of the problems I got rid of
1	I 'm somehow depressed again , and now that I got rid of my cutting problem a solution has been popping in my head more
1	Suicide , the only thing that has stopped me from acting on this thought is my family
1	They would have to spend money on a funeral and I heard they were pretty expensive
1	My counselor and I have went over all problems except this , because I know that they will tell this problem to my parents
1	I 'm sorry for this meaningless post , I know it seems like a dumb question
1	I took the advice of telling her everything I just had to leave that one part out , I ca n't bring myself to tell
1	Soplease if you can , what should I do
1	I 've been having some depressionanxiety issues for a little over a year now
1	This all seem to came about after I quit drinking cold turkey after several years
1	I 'm 24 , whether the depression is related to my drinking or not I do n't know
1	It has changed forms on me so many times from panic attacks , to excessive crying , to feeling unreal , but all lately I feel like I completely lost ALL my feelings , and am afraid I will never be the same or have them back
1	I feel unreal and like I 'm just going through the motions , and all my actions are just out of habit
1	It is so hard to explain to anyone how I feel Since I still can laugh and joke around , but there is no feeling behind it , if that makes sense
1	I have tried several anti depressants , and when I took them they made me feel emotionally numb like this among other side effects which is why I quit taking them
1	Did I cause premanant irreversable damage from my 45 years of heavy drinking
1	They just throw me some new meds and send me on my way
1	I met this girl many years ago as she dated my best friend for a short while , nothing serious as he was n't interested
1	Had not spoke to her in many years and in April last year she added me on FB
1	For 3 months we talked each and every day non stop sometimes until 5 am
1	We knew we really really liked each other and in August we got together finally
1	We were so happy , I was head over heels crazy about her
1	She had a really bad relationship before hand where she was beat up , robbed and her kid even traumatised so she was wary of men and a relationship
1	She told me she was so happy she could not believe she found a guy so caring and genuine and so good
1	She went back to college in sept the next month and with her also having a kid and us living 1 hour apart we knew it would be hard we talked about it a lot
1	I also worked nights so that did n't help
1	But we got by we met up each weekend and any other day we could
1	August and Sept we were in love it was the best I ever felt about any girl before
1	I seen this girl as someone I could marry and settle with
1	October came and she changed
1	I felt I was losing her and could n't stop it
1	Her bday was in Nov so I booked us a trip to Amsterdam with my friends as she got on great with them
1	I gave her money to get hair done to feel good about herself
1	We went away and she acted so bad to me , barely speaking but fine to the rest
1	My friends noticed it and asked her why she treated me this way and she got angry at me thinking I was telling them our business but they seen it themselves
1	We got home and we talked over FB mail as we did each day
1	3 days later I told her I loved her and we would work whatever this is out and be happy
1	She replied that she did n't think we could work and we did n't gel and we had no chemistry
1	I just lost my world it felt like
1	And the worst part was it felt like she did n't care at all it was so easy for her
1	She told me she loved me only 3 weeks before that
1	I did n't reply for days and then I did
1	She said she was sorry how it ended and I did n't deserve that I was so good to her and kind it was all her fault and sorry
1	I accepted her apology and we decided to delete each other on FB to move on
1	My belief is she had feelings for my friend still she mentioned before we hooked up she did and only after I realised
1	She could n't be around him and did n't like me to mention him so I should have seen those signs
1	Maybe she felt she could n't do it , what was she doing if she felt that way about the friend
1	I do n't know maybe I never will but she came into my life like a whirlwind and ruined it and just left to get on with her life again
1	People today , they scare me
1	Hello , A year ago I wrote how I thought I might be depressed
1	Sometimes I even feel a bit bipolar in the way that I love myself and my life one day , and the next everything just seems dark
1	I ’ve always wondered whether or not I should just blame it on teenage hormones , but I really do think I have a depression now
1	My parents finally got it out of me a couple of weeks ago
1	For some hours I sat and cried and tried to explain what was wrong with me , but it ’s just really hard
1	We have n’t talked that much about it since , and I do n’t know if they think I ’m better now   I know that I ’m not
1	I just do n’t feel like they understand the way I feel
1	I do n’t want to seek help from my friends , because I hardly feel like they ’re my friends anymore
1	It ’s nothing they ’ve done , it ’s all on me
1	I just do n’t really connect with any of them anymore
1	I ’ve come to doubt if I ever have
1	That ’s why I try to hide the way I feel
1	I feel stupid and weak for being depressed at my age
1	And I ’m so scared of going up to my parents and saying that I ’d like to find a therapist
1	I ca n’t handle this on my own anymore , that much I ’m sure of
1	I just do n’t know how to get help , because I do n’t see a way that anything will help
1	I feel stuck here , and I ca n’t see a way of ever getting better
1	I do n’t even know what I need help for
1	I do n’t know what I ’m asking for right now , I just want help
1	Perhaps what I ’m looking for is someone out there who can recognize themselves in some of what I ’ve written
1	I do n’t know what to do , I just feel stuck in the same dark cave , and I need someone to point out a direction that I can try to follow
1	I have been dating A boy for about 2 years now I 'm ld and we have already been through so so much together he literally Is such a genuine humble amazing Person but everything just hit him

1	I 'm a 60 yr old female , and I 've never had a problem with cystic breast , however within the past week I 've found a nodule in my right breast in the upper region
1	I thought I had just pulled a muscle , but it continues to hurt
1	The pain has been there for about a month , however I just felt the module this week
1	It feels like a burning , and searing pain when I move my arm to either side and even forward Even when I turn my head , or slightly my upper body to the left when driving
1	The first few times it happened , my coworker said I turned very pale , and it 's more disturbing now that I found the lump
1	Four years ago I had open heart surgery , and had a benign tumor , the size of a lemon , removed from my heart , and around it , with a stent put into the Aorta
1	A CT scan had shown a nodule on the right breast , but it was very small , and was also noticed on my last 2 mammos
1	I 'm planning on calling for an appointment tomorrow with my GYN , and schedule my yearly mammo , but should I be worried
1	My mother 's sister died from breast cancer that returned , and spread all through her bodyThis discussion is related to Lump on upper breast chest
1	I 've been pushed to my breaking point so many tines that the only thing that 's really keeping me going is my daughter and my unborn son
1	I 've been with my husband for 3 years , half of those years he was incarcerated
1	We recently got married in may and 4 days later he started cheating in me with his ex on mothers day of all days
1	I 've always hated mothers day cuz my mom left 14 years ago n have n't seen her since
1	I could n't get myself to leave him cuz I love him that much and we decided to work on things , which went okay for the most part until he started up with her again faking a relationship with her so he can see his other kids otherwise she wo n't even let him talk to them
1	Recently I received in the mail divorce papers And he believes that if weget divorced our relationship will return to normal but really it makes me even more self conscious now because my birthday is next week I 'm 20 weeks pregnant the judge wants to side with him and his ex wo n't stop harassing me and whenever I trytalkig to him he accuses me of nagging him and it makes me angry and I say things I regret then get so upset I have panic attacks and I uncontrollably cry which is what I 'm doing as I wrote this
1	I 'm so badly hurt and no one I know will understand where I 'm coming from because they all hate him n are biased I do n't even want advice I just want to cry and talk to someone and be happy again
1	I do n't even know how to be happy again idk what to do anymore I ca n't even talk to him cuz he 's working all the time now and I have no real friends everyone I know is 500 miles away
1	I 'm feel completely alone and I just do n't know what to do anymore I 'm just lost
1	Seems everything I do is either wrong or just stupid and irritates him
1	I 'm sorry this is so long I just needed to say something before I go crazy
1	i am 21
1	I had a bf who cheated me but i am so over it We were together since five yearsWe were very serious Bt never mind
1	So my parents found out about us a month after we broke up
1	I am an architecture student , finished my second year My parents cancelled my thied year admission Read all my private conversations hacking all my email i d , fb account , they told every distant relative
1	I am not allowed to speak to my friends and they are very abusing me concerning with the contents of the messages with my bf
1	Thwy make me feel inferior every second of the day Its like em in jail And the most important thing is they are going to cancel my admission in architecture permanently and marry me off
1	But they think that even a watchman will not marry me cz of my character My books are my everything
1	I cnt accept an illetrate life being so good at it Its been an year And admissions are on head
1	It makes me sick thinking about it every secondi really do n't wantnto give it up I ve tried talkinh to them but they do nt listen I ve never been to a restaurant , never gone to a theatre , never partied , never gone out qith friends And now this Ita unbearablei want to commit suicide Bt i think i am so much more than that
1	I am a 32year old male , married with 5 children yes , they 're all mine from the same marriage
1	I have a history of methamphetamine abuse during my later teens and a relapse about 5 years ago for about 6 months
1	Since then , I have tried to control my life problems by self medicating in various ways beer , Vicodin , Adderall , benzos , etc
1	I abuse stimulants when I get an Rx for them , but they are all that keep my functioning normally
1	Depression meds help the anxiety , but they make me tired
1	I recently started taking Strattera , but so far it makes me dizzy and drowsy
1	Caffiene makes me angry and scattered
1	I want to try something like Wellbutrin , but I do nt want to tell my doc that I abuse stuff because I do nt want to blow my chances with getting things that help occasionally
1	The downside is he thinks it 's all ADHD hence the Strattera
1	I 'm 16 always been depressed
1	One of my friends ca n't help cuz she just wo nt or she s just sad herself
1	My friends are dicks and i just feel lonley whenever i m with them
1	When I spoke to the counsellor yesterday I was like yay i feel pretty good
1	But like an hour later and i was like i m going to end it tonight
1	Of course I do n't really want to die I just want this to all be over
1	I have a way that I want to kill myself , but i m not sure it will work
1	I just really want this all to be over but I know that Ill be hurting people
1	I guess I do nt want to die , like if i could i would want to enjoy life
1	But I just do n't , i never truthfully have
1	my journey began in 2010 when I started having very heavy periods this went on for over a year when I went to my family dr he asked me if I was anemic I told him I did n't think so but was very tired
1	he checked my blood and found that I was
1	after that I was sent to my obgyn which did a biopy which was ok then put me on depo shots for two years to get me to menopause
1	sorry I did n't mention my heavy bleeding was coming from fibroids
1	got off the shots and was doing ok until janurary of this year 2014 then I started hit and skipping my periods
1	have one next month none that went on until may had a 7day period then in june it hit I started what was a 23 day period very heavy at times stoped for 5 days then started again
1	went back to my obgyn who told me it was menopause
1	hormone imbalance put me on prempro I am still bleeding not as heavy been taking it for almost a month he told me it could take up to 3 months to even out in the mean time I think i m going crazy cry one minute ok the next along with other issues
1	someone please help me before I go crazy
1	For as long as I could remember I knew that I had something , but I would always shrug it off because I thought it was just part of being a teenager
1	For instance , I think I have a mild form of ADHD
1	I am 20 years old , a 3rd year university student , and I always find myself doing all my assignments the DAY OF
1	My marks are pretty good in regards to my study habits , but recently I think it 's worsening
1	I also started taking Alesse , i 'm on my second pack now , and the side effects are taking a toll on me
1	I have always loved sleeping , but now I can only sleep when i 'm extremely exhausted , and i prefer to stay in bed for hours
1	I live with my friends , and i do n't even want to see nor converse with them
1	Everything annoys me , and i feel that it 's best to avoid people just so i do n't act rude or mean towards them
1	However , a few days ago i have started to cry sporadically
1	My mood fluctuates like mad , but i 'm rarely happy , i 'm just either really upset , annoyed , empty , or sad
1	I set an appointment with my doctor , but am i just being lazy
1	Now it 's harder for my to start any assignment , i just want to stay in my room and go on my laptop i do n't even want to leave to use the bathroom
1	When i start to cry or when i start to feel sad and overwhelmed , i feel really cold
1	I do n't feel ambitious , and i 'm started to get scared
1	I think the birth control pills are heightening my worries and emotions
1	And I do not know how can I post my questions nicely
1	The history starts since my wife delivered her first baby ie , before 2 years
1	After my wife delivered a baby she was on a a birth control BC loop
1	After 1 month of the BC , she start experiencing being panic , anxious , crying a lot and feeling dark almost every day
1	She also disturb me every day and we usually quarrel for no reason
1	And then her home nurse told me that my wife is in depression state on July 2010
1	Then , I took my wife to the hospital for treatment
1	She took antidepressant medicines , Lorenzepam and Romergon to relieve her anxiety
1	And she was under these antidepressant until Dec 2011 ie , she took AD for 6 months
1	And after Dec 2011 she was out of any AD
1	BUT her depression starts again on Oct 2012 she start to be panic , anxious and negative minded
1	Then we decide to takeoff the BC loop of my wife
1	And we took the BC loop on Dec 2012
1	After she is off from BC loop , she is not panic , not anxious
1	BUT , she lost her concentration and is not able to perform any of her daily life activities
1	Now , I do not want her to start the AD medications again as they have several side effects
1	However , in the mean time , i would like her to regain her concentration again
1	And also I do not want her laughing for no reason
1	So was her depression related to the BC loop only
1	Currently she is taking Omega 3 fish oil
1	I need your help in this regard
1	I was diagnosed with BPD just about two years ago when I was 21
1	I was in a lot of pain and suffering by the time I finally when to the psychiatrist
1	I was obsessed with suffering and when I felt low , it was really low
1	It started with when I was drunk , I just went insane
1	Then it started happening to me when I was sober
1	I was working a 9 5 job and was up early every morning
1	I would rarely see my house mates and on weekends I would spend my days alone because the others worked nights and weekends
1	I hated my job because I had started to have terrible anxiety and leaving the house was so difficult , I was beginning to fall apart
1	Then after about four months I began to meltdown
1	I walked out of my job , it was just before Christmas
1	I would drink , take off my brace and run down the road , risking making the bone in my bag slide
1	Every night I was cutting myself and I now have permanent razor scars on all over my body
1	Nobody wanted to know me and I was losing all of my friends
1	Eventually after a few months I went for help and found out I had BPD
1	Things got much better , I refused therapy as the services provided in my country are abysmal and refused medication
1	Slowly but surely its three years later , I have all of my friends back , and I have won the respect of my family back again
1	I am beginning to loose my grasp on reality
1	I 'm not sure what it real because my mind is warping things
1	I 'm screwing up relations with men because one minute I 'm mad about them , the next I ca n't even speak to them
1	One minute I may be fine the next I 'm thinking about cutting myself
1	I fantasize about breaking one of my arms
1	The anxiety is definitely back and its killing me and i 'm so paranoid all the time
1	I wrote a piece earlier about how I feltI would love to hear your thoughts on it and also if you have any advice on how to stop myself from having another meltdown
1	Reality is slipping from my grasp I live in existences of my own creation , existences as interchangeable as the dynamic reactions of an ailing mind
1	Scared84 Junior Member Join Date Apr 2015 Posts 15 Ok so now I am having real panic set in
1	I went through my head all the tests they put me through when I was 2023
1	I had at least 8 ct scans , they found nodules on my lings and kept rescanning me
1	I had bari swallows with xray and had a cathedar with radiation injection and a nuclear stress testall to find out I have an arrythmia
1	I ca nt even believe how many tests that put me through
1	If I had only known what it could do to me , I would have spoken up
1	I have been having bad gas that dowsnt change with diet , EXTREME fatigue , and stool that floats and is tan
1	I am terrified all this radiation has given me cancer
1	I am 30 and have two children under two that I am soley responsible for
1	This fatigue has really hit me these last two weeks , I feel like I could fall asleep driving
1	Eventually he split up with me and started seeing another girl and for a while I was really down but otherwise everything was ok
1	However I recently started seeing someone as well whom I got to know through him ages ago and when he found out his anger towards me returned worse then ever
1	He seems determined to make all our friends turn against me and constantly wants to hang out with this guy i 'm seeing
1	Its getting really awkward last time we went to the same party he turned his back on me constantly which pretty much froze all conversations
1	Then he started telling me that i just go around fing all of his friends and that i m really desperate I tried to be nice to him but I just got him even more angry
1	He is turning a bit psycho now making a point of organising events and inviting everyone but me and I m worried he will put off my new partner from seeing me he is a bit worried about getting caught up in my exes anger issues and will definitely cause a lot of problems around our common friends
1	I 'm starting to suspect that it is my quietness and meekness that always gets him angry , no matter how i try to make things up with him
1	He regularly falls out with most of his friends but they just tend to reutrn his anger and i think it works quite well for them   i ca nt do it though , i m just not able to be angry
1	Do you think there 's anything i could do to smooth things out
1	I was thinking of just leaving him to deal with his anger but i have heard of some of his exes who stopped dealing with him and he still hates them
1	I m not worried about what he thinks of me , i just do nt want to lose any friends because of this
1	I 'm a 28 year old man
1	I 've been with my wife for 3 years
1	We have had our ups and downs as any normal relationship would , I guess
1	I recently took a job working out of town being gone for a month or two at a time
1	My wife started talking to another man almost Immediately after I took this job
1	She confessed this to me
1	I respect her honesty
1	She is now 6 months pregnant and tells me she thinks this is the other man 's child
1	I was very hurt and upset about it at first but I 've already gotten those tears out of the way
1	She left me while I was gone out of town and I came home to an abandoned house
1	We have a 3 year old son already BTW
1	Her leaving with my son is what really hurt the most
1	I could n't believe it but reality set in that she was just gone chalk it up as a loss
1	But when she told this other man she was pregnant , the other man being a coward in the first place for even sleeping with another man 's woman , told her to get an abortion
1	She felt rejected by this and has gravitated back to me
1	I love her dearly and tell her I 'm still here for her and I support her emotionally no matter what happens
1	I understand people slip up I cheated on her before we got married and remained faithful to her during our marriage
1	She tells me she wants counseling and wants to try to make things right
1	keeps playing over in my mind and if I reject her now and it is my child I will feel like an even bigger idiot
1	I do want to make things right I just do n't know if I can wake up every morning to a child born from such an emotional situation for me
1	Hi , I 'd like to start off by saying thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this
1	Throughout my life , I 've always been very self driven
1	But , for the past few months , I 've been feeling awfully confused
1	Every time I sit down and try to studywork , I simply ca n't
1	I want to , but at the same time I do n't want to work
1	For my previous set of exams , a few months ago , I had had plenty of time to studyrevise
1	I really do not know if this will make any sense at all , but I had lost the ability to be worried
1	I would keep telling myself that I had to work but the other side of me that just wants to sleep and waste time would take over
1	This made me really paranoid and sad and scared And even during those shortlived moments where I felt motivated to study my focus was pretty crappy
1	I know myself enough to know how important my academics are to me
1	What is really really scaring me is that I am no longer able to worry about my grades , even though I am aware that they have been slowly slipping
1	What 's worse is that I have little time left till my next exams and these exams will actually count for my college acceptance
1	I 've worked hard all of my life to achieve my goals and dreams , and now this crappy time I 'm going through could render all those efforts useless
1	I need to start studying for the upcoming exams , I need to get my motivation back and understand what is happening to me
1	I decided to open up about this a few months ago and went to a therapist
1	However , I did not tell my entire story , I mean I downplayed everything basically
1	He ruled out ADHD and depression after some questionnaires , so I do not know what is wrong with me at this pointI do n't know
1	When i was about 4 years old , a 6 year old boy would want me to suck his penis and he would want to lick my vagina
1	I saw him once a week for a while as our sisters did netball together and our mothers were friends
1	He would pull down my pants behind the bushes and do stuff to me
1	I never initiated it but i did n't protest as i was only four
1	My parents never found out but after a year or so i no longer saw him as netball finished and our parents drifted apart
1	when i was 67 i realized what had been done to me
1	I used to cry myself to sleep every night , i was horrified
1	My parents to this day still do n't know
1	I occasionally see him but we ignore each other
1	Seeing him makes me sick
1	Through out my life i have doubted myself as a victim because i was only four and he was six and i was n't particularity upset about it at the time
1	i remember not wanting to do it but he would convince me otherwise
1	I would also like to know ways i could prevent this happening to my future children
1	I have knowledge of it as a consumer , different diagnosis and have reached out to people I know and work with who ended up getting diagnosed but it was an uphill battle
1	And some were misdiagnosed with say depression and once they understood that it was bpd , they were able to get the specific help they needed as the treatment is different
1	I think that my mom has BPD
1	I have not told her this , and she wo n't seek help because I am the only allegedly with the problem
1	I am going to keep this simple   I am just looking for opinions on how to handle her
1	One week my mom loves me and compliments me and is sweet , friendly   the next week she is indifferent to me , gets angry when I disagree with her or do n't take her parenting advice   and I mean the type of angry where she does n't talk and gets mean
1	I myself struggle with depression and feel lonely a lot and she seems to exploit this by coaxing me to talk to her when I am feeling down
1	I recently talked to her about my marriage and things being stressful and that is when I was reminded of why I do n't do that
1	Anyway she started really pushing me to let her have my kids overnight
1	I do n't want my kids to spend the night at her house
1	I do n't really like them at her house because I do n't want them to be manipulated and treated the way I was as a kid
1	I also do n't trust her   when I had my 2nd child , she was to stay at our house with my toddler but she did n't and she did n't tell me either
1	She pretends that did n't happen and it dismisses it or my anger or feelings about it
1	I do n't really want a relationship with my mom to be quite honest
1	I do n't mind her babysitting at my house occasionally but beyond that , I do n't want her to
1	Voicing my concerns and feelings has happened and they are dismissed , forgotten , cursed at
1	I do n't even know specifically what I need advice on , but I want to keep my distance from her , but at the same time her being nice and then mean messes with my head , so during nice weeks I am like why am I mad at my mom
1	I believe my9 year old grandson is being emotionally bused by his stepmother
1	This childs mother died 4 years ago when he was 5
1	His father my son remarried 3 years ago , they have 2 other children 2years and 2 months
1	I usually have him about every other weekend , he tells me horror stories about the things she says to him
1	I know for a fact that she belittles him for soiling his underwearHe tries to hide the soiled pullup from her
1	His room smells like a barn full of pigs , I went to get his clothes before I picked him up at school Friday I about passed out when I walked in his room , the stepmother said can you believe he can not smell this
1	I all but blew a fuse at her , telling her he is 9 years old he is not suppose to be raising himself
1	Since they have been married he has been responsible for washing his own clothes , totally taking care of himself
1	I feel like telling my son if CPS came to his house and smelled the smell they would probably take all 3 children
1	How can I explain to my son that this 9 year old is being emotionally abused by her and more than likely it is the reason he still poops in his pants
1	Exactly 3 years ago this week I had two diverticulum rupture in my Sigmoid Colonnearly died
1	Was rushed to the ER where a wonderful doc removed 12 inches of my colon to keep me alive
1	WHen I woke up he was standing thereI was barely able to put a sentence together but I asked him Doctorwhat caused this
1	When this happened I was running my own business and was approachingn 1 M in annual salesALL BY MYSELF
1	I hate making mistakes and when self employed if you make a mistake it costs YOU moneynot the company you work for
1	I had the business for 7 years when my colon ruptured
1	Since that time you would think I would relax and not be so high strungbut I 'm just the opposite
1	I ca nt go to sleep at night without a sleep aid because I 'm constantly replaying the days events and worrying what will happen tomorrowTHATS CRAZY
1	I 'm actually very activework out every morning in the garage and watch what I eat but seem to keep having health issues
1	Allergies , chronic pain and digestive problemsall of them are due to the stress I impose on myself
1	My best friend is from Jamaica and self employed , I 'm white by the way
1	If you have never been to Jamaica you should go but do nt get in a hurry
1	My friend will be late to his own funeral
1	He told me that in Jamaica stress , heart problems , high blood pressure , etc is virtually non existent
1	This is easier said than done but life is too short to be stressed out , worried about what tomorrow brings and what the boss thinkshe can kiss my azz
1	Tomorrow is a new day and if we can just relax , laugh at ourselvs a little we can enjoy this ride called life and lower our blood pressure
1	After years and years of living a completely unstable life , full of missteps and bad calls , I arrived at the point where I feel that I can not beat the beast in me
1	Bipolar disorder is like electricity   people tell you it 's there , even though you ca n't see it
1	If you do n't respect it   it will kill you
1	I am beginning Dialectical Behavioral Therapy next week
1	Essentially , I 'm saying that I can not get a hold of BPD because it is so complex
1	At times , I love it   the mania makes me feel like I can do everything , all at once because I am enhanced me , version 20
1	It 's only when things come crashing down do I wanna deal with the disease head on , but it has such a stranglehold on me that it has separated me into different mindsets
1	I think about and look at everything   every single aspect of my life   differently , depending on my mood
1	Essentially , BPD has split me into two separate people and these two components of Me , can not seem to team together to steer the ship
1	Years of therapy , with great therapists and consistent medication are just enough to keep me alive and out of jail
1	My foundation is flimsy because I NEVER had anything concrete in my life because BPD has been flipping the switch from dark to light since I was a kid
1	My Mom , who loves me unconditionally and who I love with all my heart has untreated BPD
1	I learned everything from her and she is the smartest person I know but the inconsistent and completely uncoping skills that come with the disease have been instilled in me since I was a little baby
1	The fact of the matter is , not only did I miss the opportunity to develop coping skills , structure , routine , responsibility in life and relationships and rudimentary stability   I learned the complete opposite
1	I will loose everything if I can not gain control of the beast in me
1	I can have a good life , like the people I see on TV , but I ca n't do it alone and I ca n't overcome it with the therapy and medication I have been relying on for the past 5 years
1	In search of the one true fix , I hit Google HARD , and found out about DBT
1	Everything I read sounded like just what I needed to fix my broken
1	My intake appointment is coming up next week
1	I 'm a 17 year old girl   I think I 'm depressed
1	I do n't remember the time when I actually felt content with my life
1	From time to time when my life becomes unbearable I think about committing a suicide
1	I feel like I do n't belong anywhere
1	My relationship with my parents is distinct , I 'm not close to my mother and I constantly have arguments with her as well as with my sister
1	My dad gets angry pretty easily   he does n't even understands me or anything that concerns me
1	I try to not to bother them so that they 'll just leave me alone
1	Recently , my grandma passed away who was the only person in the world I cared about , who accepted me   understood me
1	At school , I have a couple of close friends but my best friend moved this year
1	they do n't understand me that much I just hang out with them so that I wo n't have to be alone
1	I feel bad about myself , my body   my appearance
1	I try to be positive at times but sometimes I break down
1	I broke up with my boyfriend recently I got tired of breaking up and making up with him
1	He crushed my pride , used my love
1	I thought we 'll be always together I felt like he was the one , my 1st lobe
1	Besides I did n't want to lie to my parents they did n't know it my family is very strict and would n't have approved
1	I do n't know what to do with my life
1	I feel like my past is always haunting me
1	I 've got so many dreams   goals that I want to accomplish but I do n't know from what to start
1	I do n't want to end my life
1	I 'm grateful for everything that I 've got   I know that there a people in the world with far more worse problems and conditions but still I feel bad
1	I feel sad most of the time I do n't know why
1	I 'm do n't sulk around 247 but I cry for no reason at all
1	I sometimes feel jealous of people who seem so happy with what they got
1	I think that no 1 even would have cared if I just disappeared
1	I 'm afraid that my family wo n't understand me if I ask them for help
1	Ok , I 'm not sure where exactly to begin Approximately a year ago , I started to become someone I 'm not
1	I stopped working , answering my phone , making phone calls , going to my doc appts , and just recently , I got rid of all my Facebook , Myspace and Twitter accounts and if I told you why , you would think I 'm insane
1	When I AM made to leave the house , I ca n't stop obsessing over everyone around me
1	I feel like they are all staring at me , talking about me , following me
1	I know this sounds absolutely ridiculous , but I start rambling on about things I put together
1	Things I think they 're up to
1	And today , while grocery shopping , I had to use the restroom , but I could n't bring myself to go
1	So , now that you know I 'm driven mad by paranoia and anxiety , let 's move on to some of my other issues
1	I honestly believe that a spirit is trying to communicate with me through white noise over the past few months
1	Every time I turn on my hair dryer , shower , stereo
1	I ca n't make out what it is saying or why it is choosing me , but it is , without a doubt , there
1	I know this is not in my head , because I have not always had this ability
1	And , not only do I hear this spirit , but I see it
1	I 've been seeing it for the same length of time as I 've been hearing it talk to me
1	I 've been grinding my teeth a lot , chewing on my tongue without noticing ew , I know and talking to myself
1	I 've been suffering Insomnia for about 6 months now and The Trazadone and Ambien are both both a FAIL
1	My moods have become quite unpredictable these days
1	It 's as if an evil set in a year ago and and and is growing inside of me   bigger , and bigger and wants to take over my happy life
1	Why do I suddenly hear voices inside of my head telling me all kinds of awful things
1	I only have a very few close friends and one of them told me that not myself lately That I really ought to see a psychiatrist
1	She has an Aunt who is Schizophrenic and I 've met her Aunt
1	I know what she is getting at
1	But , here 's the thing , I 'm nothing like her Aunt
1	Her Aunt thinks she 's Jesus , for Heaven 's Sakes
1	She paces back and forth rambling things that make no sense Am I denying that I have some issues going on
1	I guess I just want some more feedback
1	Hello , I 'm 21 years old , female
1	I think I have some anger issues , where I take my anger out on anything near me
1	I was on medication but I saw no results and stopped taking it
1	I hate being on medication so I want natural ways of controlling these things , Sometimes I just wake up and anything makes me angry , I feel I wake up with a ball of rage inside me and I try to keep it inside nut the more I do so the more it seems to get worse when I boil over , I get really angry to the point where I want to hurt others who are causing me to burst
1	And I have been lucky to not take my anger out on those who I love
1	I may shout but its nothing physical , although I do thing of physical ways to take my anger out on them
1	Its just making me upset and I feel like I want to cry because Its like I have soo many things wrong with me , I just do n't know what to do anymore , I do n't want to get too angry one day and physical hurt someone I love
1	i do n't buy into the coaddiction model after have spent over a year in COSA and doing some RCA work with my partner
1	now , especially , since his addiction is so severe , he left me suddenly after disclosing that he will never be free of porn , and is tired of hiding and lying to me
1	i have a chronic illness which gave me a bad scare in my health , it was very traumatic for the both of us
1	he could n't handle it and succumbed to his addiction
1	i just want to recover from the shock and abandonment after having worked so hard and supporting him for a year and a half , with is addiction
1	i see a lot of comments about womenmostly who leave their partners after betrayal , but i see little about porn addicts who abandon their partners to act out in hisher addictions
1	all comments welcomed , and i hope to post a new thread when i figure out how to
1	thank you Tara
1	i have so many problems , all leading back to my depression
1	i am 14 and female and in need of a friend
1	i am very new to this site , i became a member about a hour ago and i could use some advice
1	i would love to have online friends who understand what i m going thru
1	i have friends , and they 're pretty cool but i perfer to talk online
1	my self esteem is great , but i m warning you , i m pretty insane
1	i like who i am , and i m called crazy by those i have told
1	i m proud to say that i cut myself , that i m depressed , that i have a heart problem i posted about in already in heart disease forms its like every new problem that comes up is good , i m happy to find out i have something new
1	depression , bipolar disorder , i m slightly ocd , i have a heart problem , i cut myself , i do n't really know my sexuality yet , my family shows no love towards me , no one has said i love you to me in years , my mom yells at me all the time and i just need to talk
1	i hate my mom because of what she has done to me over the years i do n't feel like writing about it here and please no one comment saying ' oh , do n't hurt urself
1	i do n't really care who u are , just add me and i 'll talk about whatever and i m a really good listener to anyones problems
1	I 've done some research online , but that means nothing   many times people , especially me , can form their symptoms into something they are n't , just to say they have an illness or emotional injury , so I 'm asking you guys
1	I 'm in my sophomore year of high school
1	I 'm a girl , and yes , my body image worries me , but I have n't fallen to peer pressure in years   it 's not something I deal with on a daytoday basis , mainly because I have 5 friends
1	5 because my best friend , Mark , is only my friend half the time
1	The other times I 'm alone or being pestered by freshmen or teachers while I 'm trying to work or read
1	I only have my best friend because of a separation that recently happened between my group of friends
1	I am used being alone , and thankfully I 've got my boyfriend , who lives next door and picks me up and drops me off at school   he 's always with me when I 'm not at school
1	Sometimes if I turn the wrong way , a pain shoots through the left or right side of my chest
1	I 'll stay up til 12 , with my eyes closed , trying and unable to sleep
1	This afternoon , during a nap I take almost regularly because of my inability to sleep during the night , I awoke and could n't move
1	My boyfriend and mom told me I had sleep paralysis and asked me if I was alright   apparently I was supposed to freak out , but all I did was wave it off , figuratively , and try to go back to sleep
1	In addition to my new body pain and insomnia , I have random and terrible headaches
1	For no reason , behind my eyes starts to hurt , and if I think about it o much my entire head aches with a very sharp pain , so bad my eyes water
1	They water anyway if I do n't hide from the light , since that burns them
1	I usually go in my closet , in the cool and dark , until I 'm okay
1	Unfortunately , the pain causes me to turn slightly suicidal , and I desire a razor with which to cut myself
1	I used to do it a few years ago , but thankfully I stopped
1	When I get these headaches , I begin to seize
1	If you read my aboutme , it explains that I have psuedoseizures
1	To avoid seizing , I rock back and forth to calm myself , but my boyfriend worries and does n't like it , so I ca n't do it and therefore ca n't calm myself
1	Please help me , before I do anything I 'll regret
1	I 've never met my real father but the man I call dad now is the only dad I 've ever known
1	He came into the picture when I was about 1 I think and has been in my life ever since
1	When I was about 3 or 4 I used to sleep in my moms bed with her
1	What would happen was , at night when I was asleep , I 'd wake up terrified to the sound of my mom moaning
1	I 'd hear my mom making awful sounds with a dazed look on her face and my dad above her looking like he was hurting her
1	I 'd cry and cry and yell for him to stop hurting my mom but of course he would n't listen
1	Now that I 'm older , I understand completely
1	And at times when ever the topic of my parents having sex comes up I get angry because of what I remember as a child
1	I 'm 20 yrs old now and its really hard for me to show any type of respect towards either of my parents
1	But now that I understand what was really going on next to me as I slept in that bed , I ca n't help but wonder if that was some type of sexual or child abuse because whether or not a child understands at that very moment , sex just is n't something they should see or hear
1	I have been with my boyfriend for 3 years and his mom hates me big time
1	She has since day one
1	I am 9 weeks pregnant and when she was told she yelled at my boyfriend saying what the hell is your problem I told you to get rid of her
1	Then you go and KNOCK HER UP
1	We live with his mom at the moment
1	Yesterday I went to the doctors and had my first ultrasound with my mom it was such a good day
1	UNTIL I got home and told my boyfriend that I had to go back monday for a 3 hour sugar testing
1	He asked if I was going be myself
1	Before I could get a word out she said I do nt see why the hell not after a week of being extremly rude to me and it pissed me off and then my boyfriend and I get into it because he says I need to grow up and then she has to add her 2 cents in our convo
1	by saying she does nt see why I need someone to go to the doctors with me she does nt need anyone to hold her hand
1	I say its not that i want someone to hold my hand I will have to sit there for 3 hours and I did nt want to be board
1	Long story short we are all argueing now and I leave and go to my grandma 's house and my boyfriend leave a help a friend work on his house
1	When I got home i noticed that everything of mine that was in other rooms of the house was just thrown into my room
1	Then today day after the fight She gets home from work and as soon as my boyfriend leave to go to work she throws some mail of mine and his and my keys on my nightstand and she here is your   so you ca nt say I lost it
1	by the way i have never said she has lost anything of mine So I text my boyfriend and tell him what happened
1	He calls her and jumps her   she tells him I lie what s new
1	So he calls me and jumps my
1	He acts like everything is my fault and she is a 70 year old woman and i am 20 she needs to grow up
1	Now he is talking about leaving me and frankly It might be a good thing to get out of this house but i really do nt want to lose my love and my baby 's daddy but I just do nt know what to do
1	I think she acts like that because she knows it put stress on our relationship and hopes we will break up
1	My husbands father has been diagnosed with bladder cancer that has spread to his lungs
1	His temp keeps raising and he also keeps passing out when standing up
1	He passed out twice in a row this has never happened before and the second time he was actually sat down
1	His bp is dropping , but we do n't know what 's making it go lower
1	He started his chemo last week
1	Do you think this old have effected him
1	He 's been taken into hospital because of today 's episode , but the the most frightening thing is since the second passing out his memory has gone strange
1	It 's like he 's not with itlike he 's suddenly developed some memory disorder
1	He did n't know what year it was and he did n't recognise his wife or my husband
1	I ’m after some advice about potential hallucinations … I have OCD , and GAD , and i m convinced I suffer from either BP or Schizophrenia , but my PDoc disagrees , especially with the Schizophrenia
1	I ’m always checking if I see things out of the corner of my eye , or hear thing , or smell things , i m always asking my friends to confirm if I have seenheard things etc , this seems to come in waves , I keep making out faces in carpets rugs etc also – nothing gruesome , it just startles me though fuelling my anxiety
1	I know this is related to my Schizo hallucination fear
1	However recently the following has happened to me I keep getting a strange chemical ‘ whiff’ on my left hand at work , it smells like a paraffin type waxy smell I work in the Jobcentre this has happened maybe 6 or 7 times over the past 6 months – I think when this happens I am normally quite stressed at the time Lack of sleep – although I normally am 247 I think the stress is first before this
1	I can not pin point where the smell is coming from , and it only occurs on my left hand , it does seem to spread to my pocket or clothing if I rub it on my hand If that makes sense
1	I have retraced my steps just after the smell appears , and can not for the life of me identify where it is coming from … I look crazy sat at my desk sniffing my coat etc to try and find out
1	It sends me into a panic , sets my anxiety off , and makes me feel awful
1	I ’m convinced it could be a hallucination , and a sign of Schiz or BP
1	It only happens in work … The smell gradually disappears throughout the day … and leaves me feeling confused after … now I just do n’t know if its real or not , and there ’s no way for me to find out
1	I know i m asking for reassurance … but I do n’t know what to do … its driving me crazy , does this sound like a typical hallucination , or am I worrying too much
1	I have this feeling inside me that I may be living my life full of lies
1	Although , those feelings are there alright , but i am not sure if i have been exaggerating them
1	Right now what has been getting to me is my anger , which i know has something to do with anxiety for sure
1	But anyway , as i sadi the feelings are there but what if i have made everything up
1	I immediately think , when i am having one of those good days , that everything is going to be alright again pffft
1	Then a day or two after it 's back to the normal life , which bothers the hell out of me and i do nt know why
1	I ca n't say i have huge gigantic problems because i know i do n't
1	But i feel like i have been bothering eveyrone and not just on this website , about nothing
1	I do n't know if it has something to do with comparing my problems with everyone elses to allow me to feel a certain way or something like that
1	For example i heard some people say ' You should n't be feelign this way because you see that person over there , She has it 10times worse than you '
1	Well first of all , i expect to much of myself and am struggling with my studies because i want the perfect mark
1	Although i tell others who are the same way , to get over it and that they are being silly , but i ca nt seem to get it completely through my head
1	I am frightened of being a failure , or of being the stupidest person in class , and part of me knows that i am
1	I feel like i ca n't do anything anymore , because most of the things i do are almost rejected by my family
1	Sometimes i think i am ugly and fat
1	I look at others and say , ' why ca n't i be as pretty as her '
1	Why ca n't i be as smart as her
1	I ca n't do anything right , seeing my family are always complaining , especially my grandma who has now got parkinsons disease
1	And my mum has been overweight her whole life , and i just want her to lose the weight
1	She says she has lost a little bit of weight , but she is too busy for anything else
1	I am closed in my little dumpsite most of the daymy room
1	I mean i do come out when my family calls or to eat , but aprt from that i will find any excuse to go back in there
1	He wants nothing to do with me really , and neither do i
1	So i look for comfort from eveyrone else apart from my family
1	So many people have helped me but i have days where it feels like i am takig that advice and putting into action , and others where it just feels like it does n't matter
1	I also see a counsellor , but it is the holidays and she is not around to talk to
1	I ca n't do anything amazing because i am too much of a wimp
1	I just sometimes wish i could die
1	I just wish i could scream or cry and let it all out but it 's stuck in there
1	I sometimes just wish i had someones shoulder to cry on , if i could cry i mean
1	And just hug them until i feel better
1	But that will always be part of my imagaination i guess
1	Hello , I 'm a 15 year old girl , I live in the Netherlands
1	My boyfriend lives in England and is 17
1	My boyfriend stayed over during easter , one thing led to another and we ' fooled around ' now , I do n't mean sex but basically what happened was that he rubbed his penis against my vagina , it never actually entered my vagina and he said before he started rubbing he checked for precum on the tip
1	I 'm not on the pill , he did not use a condom
1	About 38 hours after ' intercourse ' I took a morning after pill   EllaOne   We had intercourse on the 27th of march
1	My last period was on the 24th of march and ended on the 29th of march
1	  meaning the intercourse happened while I was on my period   I 'm expecting my period tomorrow but read that multiple women took the morning after pill and had their periods almost a week later
1	My period is pretty irregular but I 'm still fearing the worst as my parents are n't very supportive of abortion   which was the first thing I thought about   and my boyfriend lives all the way in England
1	He has been very supportive and sweet but obviously ca n't do much Now , my questions are How big are the chances of me being pregnant
1	How should I tell my parents
1	I have been married to my wife for 15 years and we have been together for eight year prior to the wedding
1	The relationship was good and we had a child nine years ago , since our child was born we only had sex one time , we have not had any sexual contact for the past seven years
1	I was always the one to initiate , even if it was a kiss goodbye for the day , if I did n't start it , it did n't happen
1	About two years ago I found out she was going for counseling do to her step father molesting her and she said that I remind her of him physically , and then one day she just quit going to therapy
1	Needless to say nothing in the relationship changed , we do n't even give kisses good night or goodbye
1	I feel that we are simply room mates and I tell her that and she says that I 'm over reacting
1	One day she was checking out some guy and making comments about him being hot and I simply said   Yeah but I wonder how long he would last in this relationship with no signs of any affection and told her she should be thankful that I have stayed not only loyal to her but to stay in the relationship period
1	I was just curious on what other people think of this situation and what would they do if they were in my shoes
1	I do feel bad for what has happened to her but if she is n't doing anything to help herself what am I supposed to do
1	If I suggest counseling she laughs it of and says that we are fine and their is nothing wrong with our relationship
1	I have started to worry that I may have BPD
1	I have had a horrible year , which included numerous arguments with my father and losing basically every friend i have hadOne friend told me I was too needy and did n't understand that she had a life too
1	She also said my moods were very black and white
1	She is studying to be a psychologist so I asked her about this and she said it sounds like BPD
1	I have not told her everything being we are not so close anymore
1	I constantly feel like I am alone and people are out to get me
1	I always wonder if someone is out to get me or are secretely planning to hurt me
1	I can go from happy to extremely depressed in a day and when I switch between moods I am rather confused
1	I have begun to have anxiety attacks where I can not stop crying and shaking and almost throw up
1	Since I was younger the thought of hurting myself was there but I knew I would never be able to do it
1	However , now when I get into one of these moods it is like something takes over my mind and I come very close to doing something to harm myself
1	Excuse my English , I am a 21 year old female from Greece
1	Hello , I am sorry if I waste your time for this , but I am honestly desperate
1	When I was little , I had had scarlet fever , food poisonings , chicken pox , allergies to washing machine powdersantibiotics and cats and I have had all my life constipation though now that I am smoking it has gone away and my right tonsil is enlarged Every time I go on vacation I have lowgrade fever
1	When I was 17 years old I got the swine flu
1	This year 2010 after the swine flu was past , I had for several days everyday low grade fever with no other symptom
1	Summer 2010 I got mononucleosis
1	From winter 2010 until Summer 2011 I had everyday back of the head headaches which my GP translated as stress and bad posture I used to spend TOO MUCH time on the computer and since summer 2011 I have been tortured by my enlarged adenoids which caused me having stuffed nose all the time , phlegm in the back of my throat and I occasionaly spit blood
1	gave me this saline nasal spray and since then I had been doing great
1	Then , in Summer 2012 , I started smoking
1	Since Summer 2012 my adenoids have been giving me a hard time but I get NO blood from mouthnose and stuff
1	In springsummer 2013 I got piercing stomach aches in the upper abdominal area and heartburn
1	These symptoms lasted for a few days and I thought it was too much smoking
1	I also have occasional recurring left frontal neck pains which my GP
1	In May I had an episode of myalgia doctor said it was due to infection which went a way after some hours
1	In early June 2013 I went on a summer school and had shortness of breath and severe constipation I always get constipation when going on vacations
1	I went to a local doctor who examined my respiration and belly he told that my respiration was fine and my impression of shortness was due to stress
1	The shortness of breath went away after I had a bowel movement after a gastroenteritis which troubled me and many of my fellow students
1	In my summer vacation in a small island of Greece mid July end of August I started getting worse pains and heartburn in the upper abdomen
1	I also experienced redness that lasted for 10 minutes on face after getting out of the sea water
1	In the beginning of my vacations I had diarrhea that lasted for 10 days I thought it was due to a food poisoning and lack of aftercare   I drank cocktails , ate everything a person with diarrhea should n't but my feces remained soft not diarrhea though until I returned in my hometown
1	A week after I returned home from vacation I started getting hives after the shower no matter what the water temperature
1	I changed soaps , shampoos , towels EVERYTHINGeven if plain water touches my face i get full of hives which go away after 2040 minutes
1	I also washed my face with filtered water and no hives appeared
1	I do n't have enlarged lymph nodes , I feel my right tonsil kinda big in my mouth but it 's always been that way , I do n't sweat at night , alcohol does n't do something to my stomach
1	Looking at my history terrifies me and I think I have something really serious
1	As you can tell I am a severe hypochondriac , but I read about hodgkin 's lymphoma when searching for my hives People ignored changing symptoms for years and ended up with lymphoma
1	I had MONO which is a risk factor , my immune system does n't seem pretty good and I am 1540 years old
1	My doctor sais that most of all the symptoms I ever had were a result of my severe anxiety and hypochondria and sais not to worry
1	My parents think I 'm being crazy and over the top too , but I ca n't stop being afraid
1	Do you think I have lymphoma or is it just my immune system
1	My boyfriend is 16 and has told me before that he does n't see any reason in living
1	I have been depressed before and I just assumed he was just having a very black mood as my psycologist called it and that he would get better
1	I talked him out of it and at the end of the night he seemed ok
1	He often says that I am all he has left and talks about how horrible the world is
1	He just seems to be getting worse and I do n't know what to do
1	I do n't undersand why he 's like this , his life is n't that bad , although I do understand that depression can just happen sometimes
1	He has low self esteem and hates his Dad , for reasons I can understand his Dad once told him that he saw me with another guy one day but he and I both knew that I had n't gone anywhere that night and I have never cheated on him and he does n't want to turn out like him
1	I 'm just so confused and want to get him some help but I do n't think he 'd like the idea at all

1	is it possibleSo much has happened and I am sick every time the phone rings or it is time for him to come home because I am never sure of his moodI have a fluttery stomach due to fearI want this relationship to work but I feel it is a doomed oneI have given so much to him and given my heart and soul to him and still it seems it is never enough he constantly brings up what I call stored issues that he has stored in his brain and on the cell of past disagreements and supposed infractions on my part which are all in his mindThe last thing I will bring up is looking into his eyes , they are void of any emotion and one night when he could not perform sexually , he began to choke me so hard that I had a dark black ring around my neck This happened once and I felt my life slipping away when he finally snapped with it and stoppedThe next time he tried I screamed and he snapped out of it and I told him how it scared me and he has not done this again at least not yet

1	I mean it affects her sort of periodicallynot exactly periodically
1	She becomes completely different when it 's on her
1	Her voice becomes very low unlike her usual loud loud voice
1	She starts weeping frequently on small things and strange things , and she probably suffers from hallucinations as well
1	She also becomes careless about her hygiene and becomes very inactiveShe 's on medication since a long time
1	She was quite normal till yesterday , when i talked to her on phone it seemed like its onset again
1	So i need to know what as the cause for this disease and how best the family members should get along with the affected and everything else you can
1	I 'm 42 and starting to get worried about this long cycle that seems to be getting a bit heavier instead of lighter
1	On 714 I started my cycle which was nothing unusual but here I am still on it almost 11 days later
1	I did n't have a lot of PMS just tender breasts but nothing too crazy that I remember , I know I did n't take anything for cramps or backaches
1	The only pain I 've really had was one day last week around day 4 I had to stop running because I did have some pain which seemed to be in my right ovary region and I needed to walk it off for about 10 minutes and then I was able to run again
1	I should mention I only have half a right ovary because it had to be removed when a cyst was removed back in 04
1	My FSH has been high for over 10 years well I assume it still is , we adopted our first child and then in early 2009 I thought I was starting menopause but it turns out I had one good egg left and she 's 4 years old now
1	Also this past year I have gained a lot of weight around my middle and I 've never had issues with gaining like this before , it usually all goes to my butt   thighs
1	I do not want to call doctor if there is nothing she can do but my husband is going to think I 'm conspiring against him
1	I 'm on vacation right now so I can not go see my doctor anytime soon
1	My son has been wthe current babysitter for 15 years and he loves her to death
1	well , I believe the mom next door was the one who called Child Protective services on the babysitter alleging she threw my son over her head and acorss the room , she took showers with my son , etc
1	My son went through the 1st interview at schoola dn they had concerns
1	I find it hard to belive she has done these things
1	is it possible him being six , he gets mixed up with the questioning , etc
1	Also , now we are not using the babysitter bc of this situation , have been advised not to return him to her
1	I also wonder if the mom next door is angry at the babysitter and she is being vindictive , but I htink they would have to question her girls as well , right
1	MY BACKGROUND I am a 29 year old female
1	Last year I had a slightly elevated CA 199 of about 55 Uml
1	I went to a physican and I was told that I was to young to have pancreatic cancer and something else is elevating it
1	They did an abdominal MRI in 0607 with and without contrast
1	The also did a vaginal ultrasound of my uterus because my physican said that endometriosis could falsely elevate it
1	I also had a breast exam not mamogram , because my physican said that breast cancer can also give a false high CA 199
1	My doctor felt no unusally lumps in my breast
1	I had a colonoscopy , which took me two days to prep 2 gallons of go lytley before I had a bowel movement
1	I also had a upper GI scopethrough my mouth and that came back normal
1	So after all this workup my physican has made me believe that I am crazy and I making all these symtoms up in my head , so I went to another physican to get a second opinion just recently and this is the findings For the past 6 weeks I have been getting CA 199 done every 24 weeks and it 's been slowing increasing My initial in 0607   55 Uml 6 weeks ago   77 Uml 4 weeks ago   115 Uml Last week   150 Uml Now my second opinion physican is concerned because of all the GI problems I have had and the elevating of the CA 199 so he referred to a GI doctor that I will be seeing in 2 weeks
1	MY QUESTIONS What will my GI doctor do
1	Good evening so for the past two years I have been in and out of the emergency room I 've seen several specialist including a gastroenterologist a cardiologist my primary care physician a therapist whoever in multiple blood work EKGs chest xrays stress test echocardiogram and still to this day nothing
1	I am on several medications such as Zoloft Bisoporol and Omeprazole
1	I am on one for anxiety one to lower my diastolic number in another for acid reflux
1	This all started two years ago after I got married when I got married I started having chest pain well not really chest pain iPhone my heart started to race a little probably about a month or two after then once my wife told me that she was pregnant and I quit smoking cigarettes probably about a few weeks after that I woke up with mild chest pain one morning A month after that one from chest pains arm pain a month after that chest pain arm pain neck pain back pain this is man I 'm going cycle now for two years about a month ago I had really bad chest pain again I went to the emergency room they did bloodwork they did an EKG everything was normal sent me home of my medication for acid reflux still to this day I get chest pain that wakes me up it hurts sometimes but I 'm still alive I recently seen a cardiologist who assured me it is not my heart everything looks good with my heart
1	It   because this is cause all sorts of crap between my headed Neris chest pain in lately I 'm noticing now I have a constant pain in my neck that shoots down my spine in into my arm when I move my head a certain way like tilting it back
1	I reach out to you all to see what you all think I play hockey I 'm very active I guess I 'm just trying to get answers are in peace of mind and see if maybe you all think it 's something anxiety stress Gerd anything thank you
1	So this is n't about me , but it 's about my boyfriend
1	He 's 18 and he 's had depression for 11 years
1	He says that the antidepression pills only make his depression worse
1	He 's kind of a loner except for his 4 friends and me
1	He says that he 's really happy to be with me and have someone who cares about him
1	He keeps saying that he 's a terrible boyfriend because he worries me when he feels depressed
1	I tell him it only worries me because I care about himand he does n't tell me what 's wrong or what 's causing him to be depressed
1	He always says , I do n't know , I just feel depressed  
1	Then we cuddle together until I have to leaveIt 's always around the time when I have to leave that he starts getting depressed
1	I 'd spend the night with him to comfort him and let him know I 'm still there for him , but my parents always think we are going to have sex or something
1	It 's like , you think that just because I want to spend the night with him to comfort him , we 're automatically going to have sex
1	There was one time that he got to spend the night with me
1	I had to beg my parents to let him stay
1	His puppy he had for barely even 4 months had to be put down , and he did n't want to go home until the dog was gone
1	We got yelled at the next morning because I had slept next to him
1	Here is one of the messages he sent me I think something is wrong with me TabbiI feel miserable for making you cry , it really makes me feel like I 'm a terrible boyfriend , even though you say I 'm not
1	I do n't know why but I just feel bad , I love you a lot and you make me really happy , I love having you around me and laying with you and stuff
1	I ca n't picture my life without you , you just mean so much
1	But when you 're not here I feel like , and sometimes when you are here I still feel like
1	I know I 'm happy with you but I 'm not happy
1	I ca n't explain it but I think you might know what it feels like
1	You truly do make me happy , but something is clearly wrong with me at the moment
1	I 'm sorry for being a burden to you
1	I really really love you , you know
1	I may not show it but I do
1	I love you so much TabbiI hope we can help me , I love you princess
1	And I only cry when he worries me to the point I think he 's going to leaveor when he says something really sweet it makes me happy and I start to cry
1	He says this in another message , I have everything I want but I 'm like   depressed and
1	I told him I feel like sometimes I just make it worse when I try to cheer him up
1	He says that I 'm not making him feel worse , he says it 's because of him
1	So at this point I got worried I asked him if he was still going to me with me , his response was , of course , I do n't want you to leave me , you make me feel better
1	and I got this one this morning around 2 I 'm sorry princessabout my random sadness , I was happy being near you yesterday , and I miss youI love you a lot and I 'm sorry for not being a better boyfriend , I 'm sorry I 'm negative and stuff , I just do n't know what 's going onI love you princess , I hope you sleep better than me , goodnight Also , he told me awhile back , that he did n't want to live anymorebut he said that I was the only reason he still wants to live
1	He says he 's too much of a coward to kill himselfbut he said that if I died , he would
1	He snores and he has recurring dreams of either me dying , or worse , me dying and we had kids
1	He says that every time he has one of those dreams , he wakes up in tears and starts looking around for me
1	I am in Europe
1	I waited for Valdoxan , hating the side effects of Cymbalta of Effexor which both worked well for me
1	I started taking it last May one month after a bereavement just a coincidence that was the first date it was available here
1	My first month of the bereavement was normal enough , i reacted the same as my family
1	Then i started feeling anxiety , quite strong for a couple of hours each day
1	It got to the stage where my Dad would nt let me speak to my MOM on the phone because i was too much for her , crying and obsessing over everything
1	IT WAS THE VALDOXAN , my doc even added an antipsychotic because on the Valdoxan i would bolt out of my sleep at 4 am
1	I stopped this medication and 2 days later all symproms stopped
1	Not being able to sleep all night Increased anxiety Racing thoughts Obsessive thoughts Basically it nearly drove me over the edge Be careful please
1	I know this is a lot of text to go through but I am doing my best to provide a good understanding of my situation
1	I felt a swollen lymph node around 20th June this year
1	I showed it to my general physician on 28th June and he confirmed it is a swollen cervical lymph node one the left of my neck
1	But by feeling it he did n't show any signs of concerns and told me it seems normal
1	The radiologist told me that just one swollen lymph node has no significance at the same time she said that when a lymph node is swollen that means there is something unusual
1	My GP referred me to referred me to an ENT specialist and I had an appointment on the 28th of July
1	After that the ENT asked me whether I was ever exposed to TB
1	He then inserted something into my nostril I wired camera I guess for further examination but he said everything was fine and nothing to worry about
1	I was also asked about my family 's cancer history and have I ever been treated for HIVHPV
1	However in the month of April I was with my friend we deep kissed and she performed unprotected oral on me
1	So my major concern is the ONE PERSISTENT SWOLLEN SERVICAL lymph node which I till today can feel and it is very palpable
1	Now I feel something in my elbow too
1	They are INVISIBLE AND CAN ONLY BE NOTICED WHEN TOUCHED
1	I 'm not sure but I can feel the one in the elbow getting smaller but the posterior cervical node is harder when I wake up in the morning and seems tender throughout the day
1	This anxiety is killing me and is affecting my everyday productivity
1	Back in December , about the 5th , I met back up with my longterm ex boyfriend of three years and we slept together
1	I would like to believe he would because it 's happened and I have taken the Plan B in the past
1	My periods have usually been about 56 days
1	However my past two have been only twofour days and incredibly light
1	I blamed the second one being light due to starting a 90 day fitness challange on New Years as part of my resolution to lift more and get in better shape
1	I 've been doing my calories , changing my diet , only eating CLEAN and am GAINING weight
1	My mom says I 'm insane but I feel it looks like I 'm really bloated
1	Especially when some days I 'm doing 4590 minutes of HIIT
1	I 've also noticed I 've been urinating more often but again am associating that with drinking more water however I am beginning to become increasingly concerned
1	I 'm eighteen and daughter to a single mother
1	We ca n't even afford rent most months and I have n't spoken to my ex since the middle of January when we got into a pretty bad fight
1	Should I be concerned or am I overanalyzing everything
1	Hello My name is Toni , I am a 32 year old mom of 2 children
1	I am in such acute pain I ca nt even get out of bed or lift my arms or legs anymore
1	When I walkI fall
1	When I crawl I have to stop every couple of feet just to rest
1	I have gone to doctors galore and I am constantly getting looked at and talked to like I am crazy , and told I there is no way I can possibly hurt this bad
1	Lets put it this wayI hate pills , I choke on them anything bigger than an advil anyway
1	I have a child who has a list of mental problems ADHD , Asperger 's Syndrome , Bipolar wpycotic features , depression , and a learning disorder
1	And I have a daughter who suffers from Chronic constipation and gastric reflux disease
1	If that were nt bad enough I live with my 86yr old grandmother to take care of her , and my mother who is addicted to gambling and freaks if I ask her for a night off
1	Plus several other nightmaresmistakes my sons father in my life which just ca nt go away
1	I 've had one dr say yes you have degenerative disk disease and the next say that there is no evidence of it
1	and another say I have Osteoarthritis and then the next say no I do nt
1	About 2 years ago I had a problem in my shoulder that I could nt raise my arm up , pick up anything without dropping it , constant burning pain , if I bumped my arm on wall or chair when I walked past it I was in so much pain that I was on the floor curled into a fetal pos
1	This exact same pain has spead to my other shoulder , my chest , my hip my knees and my toes
1	You ca nt even run your fingers down along sides of my spine or I scream and curl backwards uncontrollably
1	What the Hell Is going on with me , is it all in my head , and if it is why is requiring surgeries
1	I should mention when I had the surg
1	on my left shoulder the doctor removed a bone spur , inflamed tissue , minor arthritis , and tightened one of my tendons
1	a minimal amout of the pain is gone and I still ca nt raise my hand over my head
1	My mom has to brush my hair and wash it
1	that another thing I also am so bad I need help just bathing
1	where do I go what do I doIll try anything at this point
1	I want to get all of this off my chest
1	I feel as if I 'm in a downward spiral that I ca n't control , and if not that , then I 'm completely and utterly stagnant and rotting
1	The worst part is , is that I feel as if this is the endresult of problems that have been present my whole life
1	I am a College student currently struggling with his academics , motivation , concentration , and what I now suspect is an anxietyforced apathy and depression towards the world that has been present since gradeschool
1	Probably the worst thing about this all is that I do n't know if I 'm just being dramatic and looking for excuses for laziness , or if I have a serious problem this fear eats at me incessantly which , may be a sign of another problem
1	Anyway , background information skip to the next line if you do n't want to hear my life story In first grade whenever faced with a difficult project that I just couldnot get , I stopped
1	I threw my arms in the air and said no
1	Of course , this did n't suffice and eventually I was forced to work on the material through parental and teacher pressure , and support I mentioned pressure first on purpose
1	In second grade I had a similar attitude , but I did do my work
1	Moreso than anything else pushing me was the pressure to perform generated by my parents , but once again this was not unique to me
1	For example , I literally fell asleep , compulsively , during inclass reading so frequently that my teacher just gave up and let me sleep
1	In elementary school I rarely did put extreme effort into my work
1	On difficult assignments I would procrastinate and ignore them until the last minute
1	Okay , perhaps I 'm not being completely fair , for I was not a TERRIBLE student in elementary school
1	I did do my work , and I did well , but I looked for every way out of it , and on difficult subjects I tended to stressout and ignore whatever I could
1	Usually it was the combined effort of teachers and my parents giving me the push to finish my assignments
1	This trend of stress followed by me ignoring my problems has been a very reoccurring pattern in my life
1	I carried around with me literally every book I needed for every class
1	In math and other classes like foreign language when faced with difficult questions and problems I would rip myself to pieces , I would bite my shirt , bite my nails which has been a behavior that I still perform today to an extreme degree , bite my hands , cry , and express anger
1	In relaxing classes like art I would push over chairs just because the paint would n't obey my demands
1	I still had extreme stress , but I was much more controlled in most situations
1	Despite my grades which were good , I was n't put into the school 's advanced program due to the administration thinking that based on my previous outbursts it would be best for me to remain in the regular curriculum
1	I did n't care about this at the time , but it did begin to eat at me later , especially since the vast majority of my friends were in the program , making me feel alone and like a fool
1	Most of my closeknit group of friends went together to a separate private school , another closefriend and I went to another private school
1	In my freshman year I soon realized that I was completely alone
1	I had gone to schools with the same people for my entire life , and now I was in a foreign school with different people , and with no friends my single closeknit friend was seperated for most of the time and completely out of my comfort zone
1	All of this eventually accumulated into me being too afraid to even go to lunch , for I feared having to speak to foreign people and ask someone to sit down at their table
1	I ended up hiding in the bathroom every day
1	Of course , that 's pretty traumatizing , but eh No one but me and now you knows that , so you should feel honored and if you 're still reading , you 're quite the champion
1	I finally became proud of my own academics
1	I got great grades , and generally I did pretty well
1	But behind that , I had huge problems that were eating away at me
1	I could n't take criticism well , I began to become paranoid of my friends who formed their own clique ' within our friend group , making me feel even more alone , and whenever faced with failure I took it violently
1	I began unleashing anger through selfharm and generally I felt horrible for performing less than I had wished
1	But you know , when you 're writing this stuff down , it starts to get at you   Anyway
1	I loved college , for now I could finally be introverted if I wanted to without making me feel like   or so I reasoned
1	I soon started taking harder and harder classes that give me extreme difficulty
1	Old problems have started to reappear , for I find myself drowsy and sleepy in class even when I get a good night 's of sleep
1	Anxiety and fear are at an all time high now that I have to decide what I 'm going to do with my life
1	Time flies by , INCREDIBLY fast , and I feel like I 'm never ' with it '
1	I do n't pay attention in class , and instead my mind incessantly ponders random topics
1	I find that I 'm now arguing with myself , telling myself to stop thinking , to shut up , to pay attention
1	I 'm trying to give myself structure but it 's not working because ultimately I undermine it completely
1	It has gotten so bad that I at times I think I 'm mentally retarded
1	My grades have fallen hard , but I do n't seem to care
1	I initially thought it was due to depression , and since then have seen a psychiatrist who agreed I did n't go into this much detail
1	I am now taking minor antidepressants and adhd drugs , but I do n't think they 're helping as much as I had hoped
1	I now suspect I may be suffering from extreme anxiety that may be the root behind everything
1	I 'll go see my psychiatrist soon , but I needed to get this off my chest now before I go more insane with finals right around the corner
1	I do n't even know if there is anything wrong and if it 's all inside my head
1	I legitimately feel crazy , I 'll go from periods of sadness , to anger , and then to selfanger , and then to apathy
1	I would love to hear your thoughts
1	So , I have been recovering for a really bad bout with anorexia for quite a long time now , and I can say that I am feeling great foodwise
1	I have been weight restored for almost a year and I never miss a meal
1	I had anorexia for years , but like I said , it is absolutely not present anymore
1	I have found that I have low dopamine , and I would really like to try Wellbutrin as it seems to work wonders for major depression
1	I have seen a psychologist for about a year , so I have already tried the CBT tactic , and while it worked at times , I really feel like a medication would give me a muchneeded boost
1	My psychologist would support my desire for meds
1	I have n't had meds before though , so I am just weary of them
1	My questions are , how does Wellbutrin work
1	I do not have anxiety , just extreme depression fatigue , lots of apathy and therefore the stimulant would n't hurt me , but instead hopefully help me
1	I am not asking for Wellbutrin because of the weight loss side effects 100 honest
1	Finally , do I simply ask my doctor to prescribe it for me
1	I 've been taking Effexor XR 75 mg , 1 daily in morning for about 7 months , and I love it , but I 'm concerned about a possible side effect
1	For the past 6 months , I have been getting terrible nightsweats that appear to be limited to REM sleep
1	I am not normally a sweater   even when I work out I do n't sweat this much
1	I believe that the sweats are limited to REM sleep for several reasons the sweating always wakes me up , and I am always in the middle of a dream when I wake
1	As long as I am in the midst of a dream , I sweat also happens if I start to drift off and have a lightsleep dream
1	Also , my sweating wakes my husband   which is sad for him , but useful for corroboration
1	He says that while I sweat , my eyes tend to move rapidly under the lids , that I have muscle tone unlike deep sleep , which has little to no muscle tone , and that I am somewhat responsive to outside stimuli
1	All this suggests to me that I am in REM sleep
1	I do n't think that this is related to anxiety , as I get this symptom even if I am having happy or funny dreams
1	I also do n't think it 's related to room temp , as I have tried setting the temp at anything from 60F to 80F , and the sweats are pretty consistent across trials
1	I am not certain this is related to the Effexor it could simply be related to diet changes , the fact that I started smoking again 6 months ago , or the fact that I 'm in my last semester of grad school , but the symptoms started shortly after reaching consistent Effexor blood serum levels btw   I 'm getting my degree in neuropsych , so I 've been watching all this closely from a clinical point of view
1	I 'm a 15 year old , 5'9 female , weighing 120 pounds
1	For months now I have been experiencing extreme fatigue , especially recently
1	Off and on I 've been getting random infections , or whatever they may be
1	Two months ago I was in the hospital with a crippling headache , fever , and rash turns out I had strep throat even though I had my tonsils taken out when I was 7
1	Because pills would n't work , they gave me meds through an IV
1	Before that , earlier in the school year , I had stayed home on multiple occasions either because of being ill or the lack of ability to get through the day
1	So far this year I have missed nearly 11 days of school because of this stuff
1	Every morning I wake up drenched in sweat which accumulates overnight
1	Even when I remove covers , the problem is n't solved because I just wake up again by coldness
1	A few weeks ago , I began to develop what lookedlooks like some sort of rash
1	Because of this , my dad decided to take me to see a nurse practitioner at a nearby pharmacy
1	Vitals were taken , and I was surprised by my weight decrease three weeks earlier I was 128 , now 120lbs
1	I knew that I had a loss of appetite , but I was still eating what I thought was a normal amount
1	Anywho , the nurse took my temperature and I had a 101degree fever , if you 'd like to call it that
1	I had NO idea that I was running one
1	Because she had no idea of what was causing my symptoms , I was given Amoxicillin to fight off any infection that I may have
1	When I got home , I took my temperature threefour hours later and it was 96 degrees I was of course , very confused by this
1	The persistent headache that I had been having continued , getting worse and worse , especially on the back of my head
1	To top everything off , my lower back gave me nearly debilitating pain , as well had my legs hips , knees , etc
1	And every time after I ate a meal , I would get a sharp , but aching pain right below my ribs
1	9 days after my most recent doctor 's visit , I was taken to my actual pediatrician , because I was told that if my symptoms did not improve , to visit a doctor
1	Well , when I got there , my temperature was back up to 1015 degrees what
1	I told the doctor everything that had been going on , and he simply stated that it was allergies or the reminents of a virus
1	I was told by my therapist and the nurse practitioner that blood would likely be drawn to look for infections or other possibilities
1	I 'm slightly pissed off , because my parents are dismissing my symptoms and how bad I feel because it will more than likely go away
1	I am in need of some serious help here all of these symptoms are still occurring , and I just want to know what is going on
1	I do n't know what is wrong with me
1	If you read this crazy long thing THANK YOU
1	I have been on antidepressants for 15 to 20 years and I 'm not really sure they do much good
1	I 've never found a counselor that I thought was someone I could talk to
1	I have four sons and I 've been married for 33 years
1	One of my sons I seem to argue with over text messages a lot
1	He has 2 kid 's and it seems like the only time he ever text me is when he wants me to babysit
1	Do n't get me wrong I love watching my grandkids
1	I 've come to the realization today that happiness for me comes through my kids And I guess they 're not responsible for my happiness
1	I think I feel a lot of guilt for things that I 've done in the past
1	I got married when I was 16 and by the time Ii was 23 I had four kids
1	My husband was 24 when we married
1	I love him dearly and I would n't change being married to him
1	We 've both put each other through a lot of hell in the years that we 've been married but we 've overcome it
1	I do n't have any activities outside of work except my grandkids and my kids
1	I often get upset with my kids because I feel like they do n't call me enough or they do n't spend enough time with me
1	I really think I should just get off of this antidepressant medication and just get some counseling because I 'm not getting anywhere
1	My biggest fear is that I will start having panic attacks again and I can not take panic attacks
1	Hi , I am concerned about a 15 year old boy that I think may be emotionally abused
1	I an 18 year old male as well and have become accquainted with this young man through the school
1	I do n't know much about his home life , but I do know that it is not the best
1	From what I can gather from other people who have a bit more insight , his mother is not physically abusive and is mentally stable , but does curse at him , call him names , discourages him , etc
1	He has a stepfather and between the two , they have a very generous amount of income , just by the nature of their jobs , but they hoard it all up and never give him any money , even for school trips
1	I know he hates to ask , but I suppose he has gotten used to it from having to bum all his life
1	Just looking at this young man and being around him , you would never think this was happening
1	He knows almost everyone in his high school class and I have never heard him say one negative word about anyone
1	He has only opened up to me on one occasion about emotional abuse
1	He told me he does n't think his mother loves him and actually said , I am emotionally abused
1	When I showed some concern , he reassured me that it was n't physical abuse
1	It was like he wanted to talk about it , but being a teenage boy , I guess it was hard to do and I could tell it was ackward for him
1	I was speechless   I did n't have a clue what to say
1	He has my number and I tell him to call if he ever needs to talk
1	I suppose it would help a little for him to know that he does have a contact outside his home , if his home is as bad as I fear it may be
1	I know emotional abuse probably becomes very complicated when you start dealing with a 15 year old boy
1	What kind of advice can you give me to talk to him about next time it comes up
1	He seems to take me seriously and looks up to me , I guess because I 'm an older peer
1	I want to help him , but I do n't know how to
1	Hi my partner has gone to the hospital today and is there now i am at home as he is in another town working he has his mother there he has told me on the phone that when he left for work this morning he was feeling fine then went downstairs to the van and saw dreams he have having last night and fell to his knee then went to work and felt all weiird and wrong his father whom he is partner with said he looked bad to look at and my partner said he felt like crying and went straight to the hospital for him to want to go to the hospital tells me he is nt well   they have taken tests and his there waiting for results now can u give me any ideas what may cause this and he has said his left side of his head feels werid also i have some ideas but i m not to sure what to think to me could be alot of things he also said he could nt remeber the direction his dad was giving him to go to the job they had this morning
1	Hi Its been a week since I went to a club in a country where people do not speak English
1	On the next day after partying , I woke up with a bruise the size of a baseball at one of my sides and my whole body was hurting with no other apparent bruises
1	People drive like maniacs here so I was thinking I might got hit by a car , but then someone made a joke about being raped
1	This has worried me so much that I can not sleep or eat well
1	I am a guy that is now having a panic attack every hour or so for the last week thinking about the thought of me being raped
1	My anus did not hurt , however , there was some discomfort on my tail bone like when you fall
1	I do not remember any blood on my underwear or a pain in my anus
1	I have been checking my bum everyday to see signs of tear , but do not really know if there would be external or only internal lacerations
1	I have also been checking the stool for signs of blood for the past days , but can not really see any as most of it has been mostly liquid
1	I am new to the city and all the clinics that I know that speak English are closed for the holidays
1	I know its too late for a rape kit to work , but I will get tested for STDHIV when the clinic opens
1	My panic attacks come from the fact that none of my friends know where I went
1	I just walked out of the party and they found me after about 12 hours in zombie mode
1	I was drinking but do not really know if this was a normal drunk me or a drugged drunk me
1	Please , I really need your help
1	I am crying right now as I am typing
1	Just before Christmas 2009 , I went to the doctor with aching groin and armpits
1	I also had pain radiating down to my testicles , and the doctor diagnosed ' epididymitis ' , and gave me two courses of antbiotics
1	I also had an ultrasound on the area which I was told had no abnormalities
1	Just after Christmas 2013 , I felt a pain in my left groin again
1	Only very slight , but eventually I started feeling it also in the right groin , and went to the doctor in March
1	As my abdominal pains were quite bad , he suggested a colonoscopy and a CT scan of abdomen and pelvis
1	The aching in my groin has never gone away and I have been back to the doctor several times
1	My most recent test was in July and the doctor promised to call me back if there was a problem , I received no call so assumed it was okay
1	Over the last 3 or 4 weeks , I have been feeling very unwell
1	Drenching nightsweats , a sore throat and mucus at the back of my throat that will not go away to be honest , I ve had this since Christmas , which was one of the triggers of my doctor trying an HIV test , but it has become noticeably worse in the last month or two , abdominal pain and the aching in my groins is non stop , particularly the left
1	The last time my doctor saw me , in July , he said my lymph nodes had gone down , as seen by my CT scan and his own examination , but they feel swollen again to me
1	Also , I am having 10 second bursts of burning pain in my armpits every hour or so   not both armpits at same time , separate
1	Just to make things worse , the consultant who did the CT scan   who was a gastroenterologist , because of my abdominal pains   wants me back in for an ultrasound
1	Apparently , they found an ' insignificant ' nodule on my spleen , which was assumed to be benign , but another radiologist wants to check it again to be sure
1	I went back to my own doctor to ask about this   he is on holiday , but I found out from the receptionist that my July blood test , the one where the doctor promised to call me if there was a problem , was ' slightly out of range '
1	I asked what this meant , the receptionist said she was not a doctor and I would have to wait for his return from holiday , which I think is this week
1	The drenching nightsweats and the fact that these pains come in areas where there are lymphnodes , is making me worry seriously about a lowgrade Non Hodgkins Lymphoma
1	My doctor is not in the least concerned about this because a I had lymph node pain 5 years ago and it went away and b a lymphoma would show up on bloods and CT scan
1	My doctor is back this week , and I am so angry that he did not phone me back with the July test results , and I am starting to disbelieve his assurances that I do not have lymphoma
1	all while risking ridicule , threats , and negativityim reaching out here I think i might be abusing my 2 year old daughter , and i think i was using stress , living environment , anger problem , anxietydepression , or her outrageous and stubborn behavior to excuse my anger problem and lashing outwrong of me i know , and the epiphany hit me when i ask her to do something last night , and when she said no , as i started walking in that direction for the first time NOT madjust to pick up her toys she ran , hit her but and said do nt spank me and started cryingmaybe everyone else telling me i was a horrible parent and that my short temper was abusive was actually correct , and i blinded myself to it because i saw what amazing and loving behavior i could show too that s where i draw the lineim a single mom and my ex used to abuse me and i m NOT going to let myself do it to my daughteri do raise my voice alot , and when she repeatedly tells me no , have been spanking herwhen she cusses at me or calls me names i would flick her next to the mouth , and when touching something i assumed she knew better and would pop her on the hand i stayed awake all night crying hoping maybe its not to late for her , and me , to have a positive changenot only do i want the change , but i want it PERMANENT and effectivei need a way to not only quit the yelling and spanking , but effectively discipline her , and reverse whatever negative effects i have had on her mindi do nt want her scared , i do nt want her taken away , and i do nt want her to hate me lateri do nt want to be that mom that ends up bruising her child when she goes overboard one night i was also an alcoholic , but have nt had a drop for 3 weeks , and i m not tempted to eitherit was workplace drinking , and looking back , yes i have been less aggressive , but still WAY out of line and i do nt know what to do also would like to take away these rushing thoughts of being the worlds worst mother and stop from hating myself ideas

1	  i look to people around me and that determines how i see myself
1	i am aware of this and am trying to stop this , but i am having a difficult time
1	depending on what kind of experience i have with another , my mood emerges
1	i get distracted constantly i get very tense anxiety
1	I ca n't sit still in a chair for a long time trips out of classes , constant moving and readjusting in bed and chairs , not being able to sit and write or draw i 've had a horribly traumatic and complicated childhood involving mental abuse , repeated abandonment and fear of , lack of communication and education , malnutrition junk food meat and processed crap , lack of sleep staying up till 5 am and sleeping till 24 from ages 58
1	I exhibit many of the symptoms of child sexual abuse , and was most likely abused by one of my mother 's drivers on accounta she 'd leave me in a car with them in a parking lot all night when she was in a bar i was n't allowed into by the bartender
1	i have had traumatic physical abuses that were mild , but at young ages by my mother and my grandfather , both of which involved violent shaking

1	she 's lacking some sort of responsibility factor or , i have no idea
1	they misdiagnosed me with genital herpes when i was 3 i was tested recently and i do n't have it
1	YES my whole life , do you know what that does to a person
1	JEsus BUT , my mother 's ' burning mouth syndrome ' has been passed on to me it seems , and i realize that my symptoms as a child could very well be related to just that
1	they know little about the disease due to its rarity , and i think , that s what it is
1	my diet has improved , i eat not so much meat and a lot of veggies , sometimes junk but not as much
1	I have had at least 5 hard blows to the head either form falling , baseball bat it was a game , no one tried to kill me a mild car accident , and one unlit heavy fireplace

1	My boyfriend of almost a year is suicidal
1	Before we were together he was my best friend for 3 years
1	When we started dating , I was depressed not as badly as him but pretty bad , and he helped me through it
1	Now I am a year abroad and he is talking about suicide and depression and how he 's not worth anything
1	He says he has no happiness
1	I tell him that I will kill myself if he harms himself and to think about me and not be stupid
1	I am away on a very prestigious scholarship , but he wants me to come home to be with him
1	The original plan was for him to come here , but in the past week , he changed his mind completely saying he does n't have the energy or motivation and that it 's not worth it to come
1	But he wants me home because that 's where it all started
1	He wanted to propose to me this year within the next few months
1	Every time I mention him coming he gets upset and starts trying to leave me
1	Over the smallest of things he tries to leave me , but cries and apologizes and begs for us to be together an hour later
1	This is really draining me and dragging me into a state of depression as well
1	I 've told him to pull himself together but he just says he 's failed me and tells me to leave him
1	I love this guy And I ca n't leave him

1	I cry everynight I talk to myself when I go into tears and I feel like I 'm talking with god or the Aliens
1	I 'm sorry this is long , but I need to ask a serious question
1	My little sister Shannon has been having issues her whole life
1	Right now , doctors say she has EBD , OCD , and GAD
1	My mom is very in to the medical community there 's a lot of reasons to be between my sister and myself and because of Shannon , very in to the mental health community
1	She 's thought for a while Shannon 's diagnosis does n't seem quite right
1	Here 's what 's going on For a while , my mom thought Shannon might have a highfunctioning ASD , but the doc said she does n't quite fit for that diagnosis
1	She seems normal at times , but something has been off with her for the past year , so my mom and I have been doing more research
1	  Muttering under her breath , like she 's talking to someone
1	When you bring it up , she gets very agitated
1	A few times , I 've caught her in her room having full conversations
1	She 'll talk aloud , then mutter what the response would be , when nobody it there   Wringing her hands and playing with her fingers   Dwelling on the past
1	If a kid said something to her three years ago , she 'll bring it back up and rant endlessly about how it made her feel
1	She 'll talk in circles about these things and she 'll find ways to point out how the person it out to get her
1	  A common saying for her now is the whole world hates me
1	She 'll walk around saying , No one gets it , Why did that person look at me
1	, They 're staringlaughing or They 're going to starelaugh at me
1	This makes it hard to go out because she 'll bring up a reason why she would n't want to be there
1	The other day , we wanted to go to WalMart and she did n't
1	When my mom asked her why , she got angry and said , A while ago we were at WalMart and this guy stared at me
1	He looked at me like , ' What 's your problem '
1	What really happened that day was she was dancing around and the guy pushing carts stood there waiting for her to move
1	That happened when she was in 1st grade
1	Like , you look at her wrong and she goes off the handle
1	She 's constantly changing how her feet are , her hands , or she 'll dance in place while humming something
1	I think it might have to do with her dwelling on the past
1	One second , she 's totally happy and normal , and the next she 's all over the place , talking about how someone did something to her usually from a long time ago that made her angry
1	  She 'll get so anxious it makes her sick
1	She 'll just work herself up until her body physically ca n't take it anymore
1	But on a bad day , she 'll throw screaming fits and be impossible to handle
1	We got called up to school just last week because a kid brought in cupcakes that had butter in the frosting
1	Shan obviously ca n't eat that , so she threw a fit , saying the kid did it on purpose because he hates her
1	The kid does n't even know her name because he 's new to the school and been there only a few months
1	While the prinicipal is nice and patient , a few teachers and counslers in the past have suggested us homeschooling her , or parttiming where she only goes to school for half the day and we do the other half
1	Shannon does have some trouble making friends because of what 's listed above , and she thinks people make fun of her , so that does n't help
1	If she 's having a bad day , then people do n't want to be in the same room with her who do n't know her
1	I 'm bringing all this up because my family does have a history of mental illness
1	My moms uncle was actually locked in an asylum because his family could n't handle him but that was years and years ago
1	My parents are at their wits end with her
1	My mom has had to quite work and do daycare out of the home so that she can be ready if we had to get called in to handle a meltdown at school
1	I 've had to reconsider where I 'm going to school when I graduate from high school next year so I can stay home and be there for Shannon
1	She 's going in to middle school , and i 'm so , so worried her anxiety will get worse , along with the paranoia
1	We all love her , of course , but it hurts to know that none of the treatments they 've tried are working
1	My mom is worried about what the psychologist will find when Shannon goes to talk to him , and so she wanted me to post here so we coudl kind of get an idea of what we 're in for
1	We just want to help Shannon
1	She 's said before she feels so bad because she knows she 's hurting us
1	I feel awful that we ca n't help her
1	Thank you so , so much for your patience and answers
1	  Em me , Karin my mom , and Rick my dad
1	Dear SirMadam , It 's been more than a year now since I have lost my sense of being unable to feel the aliveness in me
1	I am 22 years old
1	I am 40 kg , that is not healthy , what is wrong with my health
1	I have been keep telling myself to live for my purpose , which is to achieve academic excellence , I do hang out sometimes , and tell myself to keep on going in my life
1	I does n't have love around me , is that a problem
1	I am picky at friendships , only spend more time with people whom I find kind , intelligent , and learning , do n't really have any particular friend whom I meet frequently , but a few we mail each other
1	And I do n't spend time with people I find playful and does n't even know what they want to do in life
1	I does n't have my parents , I was brought up by my mother , she was a single mother , but she has passed away when I was 11
1	Eversince then I have been living with my step sister
1	Me and my stepsister has very seldom talk , and she does n't even know what was I doing , how I have grow mentally , but she would cook for me sometimes and buy me birthday present , we have different skin tone , and that makes me feel very different when I 'm with them
1	I was sad coming from such family background that I never feel and understand how a healthy family is , but all the while the positive people I met tells me how valuable life is and to keep me motivated
1	I feel stressful at times living with my sister , because we does n't talk , and I need room for making progressment in life , which is by next year , for now I feel like I am stretching myself to live in this environment and I does n't like my country too , I am planning to leave just once I have completed my studies

1	I just had my first appointment with a psychiatrist a few days ago
1	I sought help through my family doc because even though I 've been experiencing serious mood swings all my life along with depression , self harm fantasies and insomnia , the self harm fantasies have gotten really strong lately and are worst when I 'm not sleeping and I had n't been sleeping
1	Family doc it was the first time I ever told her about this   I 'm 35 wanted to prescribe Celexa for anxiety and depression but thought there might be something else going on and worried that I could be bipolar in which case the Celexa could have made me worse
1	Saw the psychiatrist and she said she think I have an unstable mood disorder but not necessarily bipolar but needs to get to know me better and talk to my partner husband before she would feel confident diagnosing anything since she said what it going on with me can be difficult to get to the bottom of
1	She has instructed me to mood journal , exercise more , have some massage therapy if I can afford it and try going to the local swimming pool to relax in the spa when I 'm feeling anxious
1	Because my symptoms are severe right now and therapy will take time , she wants me to start to take seroquel
1	The psych doc is going to be out of the country and made an appointment for me at end of april when she is back and in the mean time I 'll see my family doc and titrate up the seroquel from the very low dose of 14 of a 25 mg tab per day
1	She said to go up very very slowly and stop increasing if I feel bad , dizzy , zonked out etc
1	She encouraged me to read about the drug first
1	I have and the main side effect that terrifies me is weight gain
1	Weight is , I believe , a major cause of unhappiness for me
1	When I googled unstable mood I found BPD and reading the DMV diagnoses ALL of the symptoms fit me well
1	I started crying it fit so well and I had never even considered it before
1	I did n't even know these things were anything different than me just completely sucking at dealing with life
1	I am a PhD student and my usual sort of sub par coping skills have been totally overwhelmed by this new stress and I 've been having big cycles of motivated but erratic interspersed with crashing horribly into depression for almost two years now
1	I hate myself more than ever , verbally abuse my husband during this it is like I 'm watching myself from the outside hating it even while I do it , I have turned totally hateful towards a few people in my life and others I 'm oversharing with and feeling totally embarrassed about that
1	I am sometimes convinced that my supervisor and everyone around me hates me and that makes me want terrible things to happen to them which even to me feels like a weird reaction to that but I ca n't seem to help it
1	I have always felt sort of unstable and constantly wanting to reinvent myself thinking it will be better if I were someone different but I can never make up my mind about who I want to be or I think I do and then change my mind dramatically after I start on a particular path
1	I can have stong beliefs about what I stand for one day and feel the opposite the next and then I feel like I hate myself for being so indecisiveand changeable
1	The overwhelming urge to stab myself in the stomach not because I want to do it but because it seems like it would feel really good if I could do that and not die is scaring the heck out of me , but I 'm scared to take seroquel , gain a lot of weight and feel worse
1	The one thing I 'm feeling good about these days is that I started the south beach diet and it is working and helping me to feel better so I think I already have metabolic disorder to some extent
1	I will see my family doc on Tuesday but have n't filled the seroquel script yet because I 'm scared of it
1	About a year ago I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety
1	Even with medication I was having a hard time with life and due to this was let go from my job
1	I lost my medication when I lost my insurance
1	I began to spiral and crashed hard about a month ago
1	When I get depressed I become self destructive
1	I started drinking heavily , self harm mutilation , and had an affair with a stripper in which I received oral sex
1	When I sobered up a bit the guilt got to me so much I had to be hospitalized for sucidial thoughts
1	I am on new medication buspar , wellbutrin xl , and rhemron but still have an issue with guilt and anxiety about the affair and possible std I may have gotten
1	I ca nt stay out of my head and still have many suicidal thoughts
1	I broke down and let my wife know what happened , for her part she is mad but willing to work it out
1	Hi there , I really need your help
1	It first started off with forgetfulness and lack of focusattention approximately three years ago but over the past 5 months she 's been hallucinating
1	We went to see a psychiatrist and they explained that she 's undergoing psychosis but they are unsure as to why
1	Then they discovered her cortisol levels were low so they put her on hydrocortisone and things started going downhill from there
1	At first the doctor diagnosed her mental illness as depression and he put her on antidepressants , but since the memory loss persisted and actually got worse , he stopped the antidepressants
1	Then somehow her blood sugar level picked up and she no longer needs to take the gliclazide
1	My mother has been diabetic for about 16 years and all of a sudden she does n't need medication
1	and she still eats biscuits etc , so her diet has n't improved
1	Therefore the doctor thought it could be aggressive treatment of her diabetes and thought this could be causing some of her mental illness
1	He stopped the gliclazide treatment but her mental illness persisted , then he thought it could be due to the hydrocortisone , he reduced the dose to 5 mg but the hallucinations has become even more frequent
1	Now she 's not on the hydrocortisone until her next synaptic test
1	So she 's currently only on the levothyroxine and the calcichew which she takes on and off
1	She used to be on 150 mg about 6 months ago and this was reduced to 75 mg and 15 weeks ago increased to 100 mg
1	My mother has no history of mental illness and nor does our family
1	This happened completetly out of the blue and she 's been deteriorating ever since , she 's 55 and the neuropsychologist ruled out dementia because her memory has n't detoriated
1	Now they reduced my hours drastically
1	Most of the colleagues do n't like me because I 'm quiet and not very sociable
1	I 've got a learning disability , so my intellectualsocial levels are awful
1	I use to be so focused on my studies that I had no time for a social life
1	Now I 've got no friends and all the sacrifices I made up until this point has been a waste of time
1	When I get a slight benefitadvantage , I always screw up
1	Because I have no friends I ca n't socialise
1	My bestfriend at the time only gave me 45 seconds on the phone before he had to hang up because of his girlfriend
1	Guys have become acquaintices and girls either stop texting me because of their BF or just playing mind games on me
1	I spend every weekend in the house , all by myself
1	Raised by alcoholic parents and constantly abused when I was at school because of my disability
1	I 've been bullied , a lot in the past 89 years and I seem to swallow the pain and play ' the nice guy '
1	I once had a minor reaction and lost 850 at the local TAB
1	I 've busted my arse 247 to try and give myself the best possible situation in life and I ended up putting myself in the worst position of life
1	I have never gone mental in my life
1	I feel like that I should let go of everything apart from work   uni
1	Meaning that I have to give my acquaintices the flick
1	I spend 40 hours a week studying and 45 hours a week working
1	Now I 'm left with nothing and no one , except my alcoholic parents that I have to deal with
1	I 'm 19 and I 'm now addicted to porn and masturbating
1	I 'd really appreciate your help
1	I 'm nearly 18 and I thought I was bi from an early age , I acted on it and experimented with girls and guys , figuring out what gender I was into
1	Now , after doing all of that , I still do n't know and it kills me inside
1	I ' stopped ' being bi when I was about 16 because i truly believed I did n't like guys anymore , there are loads of debates , especially on the internet about what makes you your sexuality
1	I feel like I need to be with a guy for security and I do n't mind kissing or dating , but I would never have sex with a guy again and as for girls , I do n't mind if I have sex or not on the whole tbh
1	This causes me no end of depression and hatred for myself , I have horrible identity crisis 's and I will be happy whatever my sexuality is
1	My parents and friends did n't mind at all that I was bi
1	My question is how do I know what my sexuality
1	I live with my aunt and cousin
1	My aunt is in her early 70 's and my cousin is in her mid 50 's
1	And my cousin slapped me last Sunday night
1	She hit me like I was a man
1	It 's not the first time she 's put her hands on me , but she kept trying to attack me that night
1	She is slightly mentally handicapped , but she knows right from wrong and is very street smart
1	She steals my things and threatened to spit in my food in the refrigerator
1	She also leaves mean and nasty voice messages on my phone , gives strange men my phone number , and tells them to call me
1	I ca n't change my phone number because that will cause conflict in the household
1	I pretty much hide in my room when my cousin is here unless I really have to leave my room for something
1	I am also bullied by my other family member about my sickness longer story
1	I love my family , but I knew it was a bad idea to move back home when I first began to get sick
1	I 've been back for a year now , and it 's just gotten worse
1	I do n't want to tell other family members that I want to leave or ask for help because I am afraid that I will be kicked out with nowhere to go
1	Any help or advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated
1	My symptoms started 11 days ago
1	Each time I landed I could feel a pain in my head that I attributed to the fact that I was stuffy from a cold and gave it no further thought
1	Later that evening I started noticing a periodic short discharge of pain in the back left occipital region of my head
1	The next day once the pain had n't yet went away I thought I should start a headache journal
1	Additionally I am concerned bc the pains are not in a single location anymore and can show up in other areas as well such as the top left or top right side of my head
1	The intensity of the pain is rarely any worse than a 1510 but I 've recorded a very small handful up to a 3
1	I have previous history of head trauma but have been asymptomatic for years
1	Approximately 12 years ago when in high school I got my head hit very hard by another kid
1	This knocked me unconscious and I 've been told he hit me several more times while I was down
1	When I came to I vividly recall that I was still convulsing as I was coming awake
1	This ended shortly after and I was quickly able to regain my ability to move around
1	Since that happened I 've never really had headaches or any issue that would've reminded me of it
1	Then again around 4 years ago a very heavy box 1520 pounds fell on the back of my head in a work accident
1	For the past 35 years I have been completely asymptomatic of nearly any head painsensations all together
1	This makes the current events concerning for me and I do n't know what is going on
1	I went to see my GP and he is referring me to a neurologist but that is n't until October 10th of this year
1	I walkjog 46 miles every evening even now and this does n't seem to aggrevate my symptoms
1	In fact , what is strange is that I usually feel better during exercise than any other time of the day
1	Based on this I 'm less likely to believe it is related to an aneurysm or a tumor but I 'm definitely not a medical professional
1	I 've tried so hard to find similar symptoms online but nothing has stood out to me as being strongly similar to my description
1	Thank you in advance for anything that you can contribute
1	I am 33 years old
1	I have too many inner issues to even start to list that go back to childhood , but I am trying to figure out whether or not to seek some help
1	Some of the thoughts that go through my head almost on a daily basis are really starting to rev up , And although I have n't yet , I fear that my control on them is slipping
1	Some of the issues I have are paranoia , extreme anger to pure rage , depression , I become very withdrawn from people including my wife , among other things
1	My thoughts will range from suicidal to homicidal according to my mood
1	When I 'm not down or angry I am happy , the life of the party , charming and whitty , but those days are few and far between anymore
1	I know that s not healthy and I 've tried to change it myself to no avail
1	I know that I should seek a professional but I 'm afaid of what may come of it
1	I am an odd cookie to say the least and this is n't even stratching the surface but I have to start somewhere , right
1	I am a 22 year old female
1	I have been clean off of drugs for a year
1	This being said , I have became more health conscious but i m starting to feel like it has gone too far
1	My first problem is that eating is difficult and at this point I feel like I have developed anorexia
1	But it is not due to my self image , I have always been skinny , I know i m not fat and I never have felt fat , if anythingI wish I could gain weight
1	When I eat too much , I get very tired
1	If I eat breakfast in the morning , I feel so sluggish the entire day , so I always skip breakfast
1	By the time I actually eat something , I have to be very careful HOW much I eat
1	Usually I can only stomach half a bagel , A full bagel at one sitting will make me feel sluggish and I start to feel unmotivated and unproductive and it makes it difficult to get threw the day
1	By the time I am done my daily work and activities and I am ready to eat , it is too late at night for me to order food or i m simply so lazy I just do nt care to eat , or I eat something small like ramen noodles so i m not starving
1	Eating is SO MUCH FUN , i LOVE EATING , but I hate the way i feel after so I try to control how much I eat
1	I also start to become paranoid that I have heart problems and every time I eat something I am afraid I will start to feel pain in my heart or somewhere else in my body
1	My period is late and I am starting to believe it could be from this problem
1	I have also recently had a copper IUD removed that has caused me MANY HEALTH PROBLEMS and i believe that could have contributed to my health anxiety as well Any similar stories would be appreciated
1	As much as I hate the term that 's what she calls herself
1	As soon as she found out about me she freaked and would n't let him see his daughter
1	She has let him visit from time to time but not much
1	My husband and I dated for a year and got married in June , it is still an issue with her and she hates me for some reason
1	Last night I went with my husband for the first time to meet his daughter and she threatened that she would leave or hurt me if I was to meet her , so he did his thing and I waited
1	I know she most likely still has feelings for him and that 's the reason she hates me , I tried to talk to her and level with her so that we can meet up avoid issues and let my husband , myself and my son try to connect with his daughter as a family
1	She told me that it was no of my business and to stay out of it
1	I guess my question is do I have a right to be involved or do I leave it alone
1	I do n't want to over step my boundaries but what is my role in all of this
1	I hate my parents , simple as that
1	They make me want to kill myself
1	I am an extremely good rugby player , that is not my words those are the words of my coach
1	The deputy head at my school is eager to see me have a scholarship at a school on the mainland
1	I spend my whole time training if I 'm not at school , I am in three rugby teams and two football teams
1	I have been asked to join another team but my parents ca n't be bothered going away with me
1	They always make me cry
1	I hate my mum the most
1	She thinks she knows so much about rugby or about electronics but all she does it talk out of her arse
1	My dad and I can spend hours alone together and not say a single word
1	I have two sisters and both of my sisters have cocked up their lives and made a mess of everything , both also left school
1	I have been in school for a couple of years now and I have already done better then they did
1	My teachers love me , and although I spend 60 of my time training I still manage to get fantastic grades and maintain friendships
1	Then when I get home and I 'm exhausted they expect me to do more
1	I eat more calories , which I am suppose to since I am a teenager and I 'm growing , and I am doing so much exercise and my dad calls me fat
1	They do n't understand how hard I work , and constantly make me cry
1	They once bought me a little cake to say sorry for being so mean , and after looking at it I realised they had bought one that had been marked down in the shop and had scratched the tag of it
1	They also wo n't spend more then £ 60 on my Christmas present
1	I am more responsible , and just generally better then both my sisters who were smoking at my age , but yet they constantly talk about my sisters , maybe it 's because I 'm not a girlie girl , I do n't know
1	My friends are the only ones keeping me alive , literally
1	And do n't say , just sit down and talk to them , I tried and they just laughed and accused me of attention seeking
1	Hi guys , I hope you are all well today
1	Today I went to see my doctor because of my low mood
1	It took an awful lot on my part to go to the doctor 's and open up about how I really felt inside   not that I got much opportunity to open up
1	Can anybody tell me if what I experienced is a standard response from a doctor   or should she have done more
1	From my point of view I felt that the doctor should have probed more , asked more questions and shown more concern
1	Not because I am hung up on getting concern from people   but because surely , as a doctor , she should realise that there could be other hidden things which I am not opening up about and she should know that there could be a million hidden reasons for why I feel the way I do
1	How does she know that I did n't undergo some traumatic thing in the past which I need resolving , how does she know that I was not begging for help before I go and top myself or shoot a family
1	I am not going to do that by the way , just saying she does not know that She just kept pushing the antidepressants
1	I actually felt worse when I came out than when I went in
1	What I mean is , if I did plan on doing something serious to myself or someone else then I doubt I would have told her in a 5 minute conversation
1	I felt as though I was crying out for help and got sent packing
1	Anyway , here is the appointment Dr How can I help you today
1	Me In life , in general , I ’m having a bad time
1	Dr puzzled expression Me Most days I do n’t want to be alive
1	Me Well , it ’s not quite like that , it ’s more like I just would rather be dead – as in , I would probably be better off not living , it would n’t be as hard to cope – I just do n’t know how I would get there
1	Me thinking Dr You know , like have you decided on hanging or Me No , not as such
1	Dr Ok , well it ’s good that you ’re not planning it in your head
1	Me Well , it ’s been getting worse for the last month at least but I would say there has not been a time in the last 12 months or 2 years where I have not felt down or depressed – it ’s as though it has taken a different turn though more recently
1	Dr Last time I saw you you were trying t o come off Tramadol – are you off that now
1	Me I ’m down from six or eight per day to two per day at the moment but have not stopped completely
1	Dr I think that could be what is making you feel so down then because coming off those tablets will have an effect on you
1	Me It could be partly to do with that – I have felt a lot more emotional and sometimes really angry
1	I am a calm person usually but I have been finding it hard to not get angry and upset about things
1	However , before I started the Tramadol I was a couple of months into a course of Citalapram because of depression
1	I came straight off the Citalapram though within a week of being given Tramadol , I ’m now starting to feel the way I used to feel before I went onto Tramadol
1	Me It ’s difficult to say because just at the time they would have been hopefully kicking in I also had to stop taking them because of the pain killers
1	Dr Ok well it could be worth trying the Citalaopram again now and see how you get on
1	I want to explain a bit more too about the effect it ’s having on me
1	Dr waiting Me I ca n’t sleep
1	I never want to get up and face the day
1	I shake my arms and hands and legs – quite often at night
1	Even when I am still , inside it feels like I am exploding – like my blood is Lucozade
1	I lie there , even at 3 am and feel like I need to run a marathon , but at the same time I ’m lethargic and unmotivated
1	Dr Ok Me I do n’t enjoy anything , or socialise
1	Dr Ok , so I think the best plan is to try you on a low dose of Citalopram , that ’s the first port of call really
1	There are 10 questions and I answer 5 out of 5 for 7 of them
1	Then I give the form back Dr I looks like you may be suffering from moderate to severe depression given your answers so I definitely think it ’s worth trying the Citalopram and then coming back to see me in a couple of weeks
1	Me Ok , I am happy to try those
1	I really feel as though I need some help
1	Dr There are charities out there who you can get in touch with if you are feeling down
1	You can look them up on the internet and get the number , just give them a call
1	Me I meant can you refer me to somebody for therapy or counselling
1	Dr The thing is , if I refer you to the mental health team they will most likely just send you back and ask for you to be referred on to one of the charities
1	It ’s just that I am really struggling to cope every day and I ca n’t carry on
1	I ’m having problems in my relationships with my family and my girlfriend that I ca n’t deal with and I have had issues going back for years that I want to sort out and need help with
1	Dr You could look up CBT , that may help you
1	Me Yes , I know about CBT
1	Dr The thing is it ’s probably about you having to change the way you think about things if you want to get better
1	Me I understand that , yes
1	And I have read a fair amount about CBT not long ago
1	Dr What we will do is start you on the Citalopram and you can come back in two weeks time and see how things are going
1	Me Ok What days are you here
1	Dr I ’m only in on Fridays
1	Do you think I should go back
1	I think I may be a sociopath or something else like it
1	I 'm a pathological liar , I have shallow emotions , and I 've never felt remorse or shame or guilt over something I 've done
1	I do n't feel attached to anyone and I do n't have friends
1	When I do I do n't care for their emotions and lie to them about everything
1	I make a plan in my head and do anything to make my plan come true
1	I make up things about my past to get my way with people , to make them feel bad about me , to get them to do things for me
1	I convince people that they came up with an idea when I planted it in their brain
1	I make people feel about something they thought was their idea to do when it was n't
1	I 've day dreamed about my family dying in so many different ways so that I got the death money or so that I lived with a relative I had or so that people felt bad for me and I got things
1	When I 'm in a relationship I do n't have an emotional attachment to the person , I 'm just bored and I do n't care if they get hurt
1	I made my last boyfriend break up with me by saying certain things because I wanted the relationship to end looking like he was the shallow mean one , the villain
1	I 'm a horrible person , I know that a lot of the things I say are lies to the people around me , but I never admit to it or feel bad about it or regret my lies and want to tell the truth or come clean
1	I know that I need help , but I 'll never do anything about it
1	What I did was wrong in most peoples eyes , but it got me what I want
1	I also talk fast and my words get jumbled up
1	When I type it takes me forever to write something else because I 'm always editing it because it tends to never make sense the first several times
1	I talk to myself in a language that is n't real and I am always walking around my house
1	I 'm positive that someone is always outside my window or trying to break into my house at night
1	I 've thought about being a ruler and having to chop peoples heads off , and that thought does n't make me feel bad or sick
1	I 've studied different cases and killings and it just interests me
1	for the last 6 months or more every time me and my husband get into a argument he will tell me that we are getting a divorce
1	last night i was driving home from work and he was in the passenger side of the car
1	and like usual he started to complain that i could n't drive we live 5 min from work i have a valid driver licence and in 20 years have been in one accident where someone rearended me
1	so we park at home and then he looks at me and calls me a idiot
1	we go in the house and he starts yelling that i was making his blood pressure go up and i was stealing our money and not paying bill not true he then says we are getting a divorce , so by this time i was angry to and said fine by the first of the year he can start saving his money and get out the house was mine before marriage after i cooled of i went to him and told him that i love him and did n't want a divorce
1	he said no i said it so i 'm getting it
1	what should i do he has a short fuse and he will get mad at anything
1	i get called stupid , retard , idiot , worthless we have been married 4 years when we first got married he would get drunk and break furniture , he ripped up most of my pictures of my parents
1	but he has n't done that in over a year now it it the name calling and he has 2 kids by a prev relationship and he some times does this in front of them

1	Ever since 6th Grade my life started going downhill and I 'm in 11th Grade now and things just seem to be getting worse
1	Note Since a lot of people are involved in the following story I m going to give them fake names so things do n't get to confusing In 6th grade my best friendFrank since kindergarten stopped being my friend and instead he became best friends with someone elseBrandon who always made fun of me
1	Another one of my friendsAdam also left me to become friends with Brandon
1	The ironic thing is that in 5th grade Brandon and Adam had gotten in a fight and they had to go see the principle and it turned into a whole big thing so Adam needed a witness to say that Brandon had hit him so since I was there and had witnessed what happened I volunteered to go to the principle and tell him what happened
1	Some how Adam and Brandon became good friends and instead of Brandon blaming Adam for going to the office and telling on him , he blamed me for backing up Adam and it seemed like everyone else did too
1	I started hanging out with 2 of the new kids that year and someone else who had been at my school for a whileTheir names were AnselHe seemed pretty normal at the time , FionaShe 's really nice
1	Adam , Frank , and Brandon kept making fun of me and spreading rumors about me that year which caused me to lose all my self esteem by the end of the year
1	Adam , Frank , and Brandon still made fun of me
1	I joined choir and so did Evelyn
1	I found out she has a crush on me too so we started going out
1	Even though things still sucked in 7th grade it was probably the best year out of all of them because at least I had Evelyn but i would soon wish I had never met her
1	For Christmas I bought her an Ipod and she bought me a Game Boy DS
1	Lawrence is probably the best friend I ever had
1	He is the only friend I ever had that never betrayed me beside Fiona
1	That year I found out that Evelyn and Ansel made out behind my back
1	She was the only reason my life was worth living
1	Fiona comforted me for a while by saying bull   like Everything going to be OK but when I faced reality her bull   stopped helping
1	When I asked Evelyn why she had made out with Ansel behind my back she said he forced her to
1	Deep down I knew It was a lie because Ansel was really weak and chubby and the lightest punch would leave him on the floor , but I just really wanted to believe her
1	When one of the girls in my class decided to lie and say I beat her up and sexually molested her why she did that is a long story so I wo nt go into it but i honestly did n't even touch her
1	She did n't tell her parents not to call the police because then she would have to admit that she was lying
1	The police came to school , cuffed me in front of everyone , and drove me away and booked me
1	My lawyer said there was a high chance i was going to have to go to juvi
1	She tried to say sorry to me on a couple of different occasions but she never did
1	and after showing them some pictures of that girl hitting other boys they realized she s a trouble maker and dropped the case
1	After all that Evelyn broke up with me
1	She was going to break up with me earlier but since I was probably going to go to juvi she had n't because I guess she did n't want to make things harder for me then they already were
1	I still think about Evelyn every day
1	Some days I feel so bad I just start crying
1	Sometimes it takes me up to an hour to do the simplest tasks
1	My parents got very angry that year
1	Every day I came home from school until the next day that I went to school they were constantly yelling
1	Once again Fiona tried to comfort me
1	I started having a crush on Fiona but that did n't mean I stopped missing Evelyn
1	In 9th grade the girl that had said I beat her up was expelled
1	Everyone blamed it on me but she really got expelled because she got straight F 's
1	Everyone kept saying Are n't you the kid who beat that girl up and I mean everyone High school , Middle School and even Elementary School
1	A lot of the guys were pissed at me because the girl used to always unbutton her shirt in class and they thought it was my fault she got expelled
1	I started working at school again because I was sick of the yelling at home
1	but after a lot of my friends leaving me and Evelyn leaving me I had no self esteem and so I did n't ask her out
1	Frank and Lawrence did n't like each other so I had to choose either one or the other
1	Unfortunately I chose Frank even though he had left me for Brandon and Lawrence had been such a good friend
1	I felt so bad after I did that
1	I felt like I was a horrible person but it was too late to go back
1	Still had a crush on Fiona but I did n't ask her out
1	Frank tells me he has something to tell me
1	He tells me that he has had a crush on Fiona for 2 years and finally had enough courage to ask her out over winter break via email
1	She never had a crush on him but she said yes
1	They have been going out for 1 week and when I asked her If she likes him now she said she developed a crush on him
1	I feel like my heart has been torn apart
1	Now they hang out together and I do n't hang out with them anymore because I feel like a third wheel
1	I usually talked to Fiona when I felt really depressed but I ca nt even do that anymore
1	There has been so much school work lately some nights I do n't sleep at all
1	Even when we do n't have a lot of school work , I still ca n't sleep because I keep thinking about everything that has happened to me and all the mistakes I have made
1	I 've been awake for 43 hrs right now not counting when I fell asleep in class
1	I have to work really hard to get into university , where I have to work even harder to get a good job , where I have to work even harder to support myself untill I die
1	I 'd just be getting rid of all the work and hardships i 'll have from now till I die if I commit suicide
1	I 'm always afraid something bad will happen to me , someone 's gon na yell at me etc
1	Years of anxiety and depression have drained my defenses and I 'm startled by even small things much less bigger ones
1	A big issue for me is feeling like I ca n't stand up for myself or act co fident anymore
1	Putting on a false front for years has exhausted me as well
1	I have a friend that has never really listened to how I feel
1	They know I have depression and panic attacks but it 's been a case of judgement getting more apparent over time
1	It 's like they do n't think I 've done enough to help myself and also my problems have been treated flippantly and even used for jokes at my expense
1	I thought the limitations would make a lightbulb go off and they 'd realize , oh yeah , you may not be able to see a condition , there may not be crutches or a wheelchair to make it visible , but yes it 's real
1	With all the dramas in this person 's life that I 've listened to for years , I 've never felt like I could call them and just talk about how bad I feel
1	I guess their problems are considered nor , al while mine are a never ending irritation , mind you , I realize that having depression combined with anxiety can be a drain on people
1	But damn , really I 've held in more than I 've expressed
1	I 'm tired of making exuses for myself defending my limitations
1	Like I said , I seem to be afraid of my own anger and or taking up for myself
1	It 's like if I let go and point out the hypocrisy and issues I 've had with their two faced patterns something will explode or I 'll have a total nervous breakdown if I let go and say it like I see it
1	They 've had plenty of their say , and I 'm angry
1	I try to tell myself to let go but I 'm human
1	I guess I 'll have to let God fight my battles because this awful illness has taken all my confidence
1	Is there anyone else out therenthat feels like they 'll implode if they try to stand up for themselves
1	Living with this feeling every day is so damn hardI mean I can do itbut like it 's so hard to explain
1	I know most of you probably feel similar in some way
1	Every night it 's so hard for me to fall asleeplike sometimes not until 3 or 4 in the morning
1	I do n't really eat a lot anymore , and I 've always been kind of skinny , but still that makes it worse
1	it 's not like I do n't eat anything , I just do n't feel hungry sometimes
1	I know I 'm not alone but I have n't met a single person yet who truly feels this
1	Like sometimes I really just do n't know what to dolike right nowso I 'm just lying in bed here thinking
1	Seriously when will this   end I just wanna like be angrysad at the same timeit 's so hard to feel anything which really I hope some people will tell me how they do it every day
1	I do n't know if anyone can help me
1	My son was diagnosed with schizophrenia a year and a half ago but a few months before he was diagnosed he told me that he was transgender
1	This surprised me because I remembered that at the age of 13 or 14 he was looking longingly at his sisters girl friend who had come to visit for a few days
1	In his senior year he briefly dated a girl for about a month and told me she was his girlfriend
1	He never told me any of the details and I did n't ask
1	About four months after that he was diagnosed with sz
1	In the mean time he is in support groups for transgenders under the encouragement of his psychologist who does n't have a lot of experience with sz
1	My husband and I would like him to go to a different psychologist , one who has experience with sz
1	It 's hard though because he likes his current dr and we do n't want to alienate my son in any way
1	We will support our son if he truly is transgender but something tells me that it is related to the schizophrenia
1	I have wanted my son off zyprexa for awhile
1	Everytime he comes off an amount by the 3rd day he gets sucidal
1	how do I wean him off safely
1	It has never helped his depression , he has started lithium and seems okay , he was extremely senitivie to all medications , like zoloft prozac , all very bad
1	he was going to the hospital to get off zyprexa safefly but because they read into the withdrawls instead of who he was they would n't take him off anything unless he was on something else
1	I am so tired to doctors telling me to go off zyprexa but put him something else
1	It does n't work , because you do n't know which medicine is giving him the withdrawls
1	For all the people taking zyprexa , my son is living proof you can get very bad side effects coming off zyprexa
1	If there is anyone out there who can tell me how to wean his off very slowly and safely
1	He is on 25 mg on day , not much now but he was on 15 mg day and its been very difficult and dangerous to get him down to this amount
1	Does anyone know how to do this 1 a week , one every 3 days , any help from a doctor I would really appreciate this
1	I am fifteen and I took LSD six days ago
1	Ever since my extremely bad trip I 've been met with anxiety and what I think may be depression
1	After tripping I occasionally get waves of anxiety , my heart beat will accelerate and I become frightened
1	I just need reassurance it will continue to taper and I will return to how I was before taking LSD
1	I 'll tell you about my trip so you know what I went through
1	I had just gotten off of school and I had school the next day
1	We arrived at his house around 4 pm and I decided I was going to drop acid that night and just go to school the next day
1	We started walking back because I wanted to trip at my house , he walked with me in case I started tripping on the way and needed to guided
1	I took a single tab as we started walking
1	I did n't feel it until we got near my house and I felt a pang of panic
1	It quickly subsided and we continued towards my home , I was beginning to feel it
1	As I got nearer to my house I began giggling and smiling for no reason
1	We arrived at my house and parted ways
1	I went inside and decided I would explore the internet while tripping
1	I began to panic again , I had not anticipated it being so intense so quick
1	I decided I need my friend
1	I , after getting and apple went outside and chased after my friend
1	It had been about ten or fifteen minutes since we had parted so he was long gone
1	I quickly was met with more panic because I felt that I was running too fast
1	I dropped my apple and began walking back home
1	I went inside and started pacing through the house , mind you my stepmother was home at the time and was unaware I was tripping or that I smoked
1	After pacing a bit I then begged my stepmother for a Xanax because I read it is capable of ending or dulling a trip
1	Now , she had a Xanax because she is riddled with health issues coming from her past drug usage not LSD , apparently she has used something that goes by the name of K2 , I 'm not familiar with that drug
1	She is allergic to a lot of medication so she is constantly trying new medication trying to find something that consistantly helps her
1	Anyways , she freaked out and called my Dad
1	He came home and they took me to the hospital
1	He kept saying he was disappointed
1	We went into the emergency room and they got me set up
1	My Dad called my Mom and when she showed up she began crying
1	I was given something that is supppsed to knock you out and I stayed awake but my family calmed me down and my heart beat regulated
1	We were in there for awhile , my Dad left to go to his weekly pool game and my mother remained at my bedside
1	I stayed at her house and I felt significantly calmer and I relaxed for awhile
1	I tried going to sleep but could n't , I had read LSD causes this so I did n't panic
1	After awhile I got scared I would n't be able to immerse myself into daily life again
1	I browsed reddit until I fell asleep around 4 am
1	I slept a lot the next day and was fairly calm
1	My parents called me in sick from school
1	I felt a little dissociated from things the next day but I remained calm
1	I went back to my Dad 's house on friday night and I gave him all my marijuana paraphernalia
1	We talked for awhile , he said he was disappointed but he loves me
1	He said that LSD now is n't the same as the 60 's and that there is meth in it
1	My family is disappointed but they are n't rejecting me
1	I hope they understand I 've learned my lesson
1	Anyways , I went to work with my father on Saturday and I played on an old DS to stay occupied , I knew I had to just move on
1	On sunday I was fine most of the day but around 6 pm I felt my heart rate getting faster and I felt a lot of anxiety
1	Over the weekend I did have some caffeine if that might have contributed
1	I had a cold the whole weekend and it was waning on Monday
1	On Monday I went to school and prepared for finals because this is finals week
1	I had anxiety and a fast heart beat all day and by the end of the day I was exhausted and I felt a lot of fatigue
1	After school ended I went home and I tried to fall asleep , because I could n't I played games for awhile and relaxed
1	Went to sleeo around 9 pm , I did n't have much trouble falling asleep
1	Yesterday after I ran I felt really good
1	Today at school I had very little anxiety and I felt normal at the end of the school day
1	When I got home I still felt fine
1	After I ran I began to feel some anxiety and lack of motivation which led me to write this
1	Do I just need to power through now and I 'll feel good again over time
1	I 'm open to smoking again but in the far future , as long as I do n't feel like this
1	I have a step son who is 4 , and I 've always been in his life his dad and I were best friends when he was born , then started to date when he was about 1 , we got married when he was almost 3 and now he 's almost 5
1	Anyway , he has seen me in my underwear before , but not naked
1	He recently saw me in my underwear and a t shirt after waking up and asked me what 's that
1	I 'm not wearing immodest underwear , nothing sexy or see through , they look like tight short shorts
1	But my husband immediately says go put some shorts on and made me feel embarrassed about the whole thing
1	I think questions and curiosity are normal at his age , and clearly I 'm a motherish figure in his life , so I do n't think there 's anything wrong with explaining that girls have different parts than boys
1	It 's not like I was going to SHOW him mine or anything
1	Bottom line , I think his questions came from a place of innocence and curiosity , and the last thing I want to do is teach him that there 's anything to be ashamed about when it comes to our bodies
1	Again , I 'm not naked around him , I 'm not his mother and I realize that would be inappropriate , and as he gets older I will cover up more
1	This is the first time he 's ever paid any attention to it , by asking that question , and I feel like we totally blew it , as parents , because instead of answering his legitimate questions , his dad just told me to cover up and ignored the question
1	Is his dad right or am I
1	Hey Guys i was wondering if anyone could help me
1	MY sister always been the shy nervous type but this last year is has come to the extreme and i just ca nt handle it on my own I 'm the only one shr will talk to it about and she is now on anxiety medicine for about 3 weeks that do nt seem to be doing nothing at all THis is what she goes throughShe wakes up worrying about what people think of her
1	if people are tlaking about her behing her back , if she dropped something that she would nt want anyone to see   and she will back track herself SHe terrified of not being perfect and people thinking she is not perfect
1	SHE LKE NEEDS TO BE PERFECT she comes to me everyday with new anxiety and fears and it was nt bad at all when we were younger but now i can see her pesonality changing and everything about her all focused around fears of not being perfect and people not like ing her247 I drove her to talk today and she was telling em about all this stuff and needed an umbrella so i cgave her the one in my car and out of knnow where for no reason she was like wat if something bad was in the umbrella and fell in her purse and she did not at all want to take her purse in work cuz of a damn umbrella that has nothing wrong with it but i yalked her down made her sit and breather asn think of what she is saying and re evalute wat she is doing then she was fine On my way home a broke down crying   and i do nt cry like seriously it gtta to be something bad for me cry and ithink the worse thing in the world would be to lose my sister from fears and anxiety i just ca nt deal with it anymore i ca nt see my older sister go through all this and live like this we are only a year apart and she is my best frienddoes anyone think this is skitzophrnia i m a post it i nthat forum too Also does anyone know what kind of therapist i should take her too

1	like she do nt even want the therapist to take notes incase he would drop them i dunno does anyone know what this sounds like i just want ehr to be able to LIVE her life
1	Hi there , I 've been reading many of your posts and I have the feeling they 've helped me a lot
1	I still have some questions regarding my own story
1	I 've been with a man now for about 4 months
1	He shows some behaviour which makes me think he suffers from bpd
1	He seems to show some awareness , regretting actions or disruptions he 'd done when angry , which he 's easily
1	He 'd also burnt himself with a cigarette some years ago
1	However , I did n't dare to bring up the topic of bpd and he did n't say anything
1	At first we lived in two different countries and our relationship started out as an affair
1	From the beginning he was complaining about the boredom of his daily life and his emptyness
1	This was hard for me to imagine as I very rarely have that feeling
1	We started seeing each other on a regular base on his day off
1	He very soon told me that he needed paper to go visit his home country
1	He did n't ask me for anything directly , though
1	I thought that we 'd see how our relationship was going
1	He asked me later whether I had fallen in love with him and I said yes
1	He was so sweet and caring , holding hands all the time , he cooked for me the best food I 've ever had and made me meet his friends
1	It was as if had left part of my body with him
1	He said from the very beginning that he loved me
1	Then , after three meetings one month he wanted to talk about our future
1	I was happy to talk about it because I had a good feeling about us
1	I said that for me it was not so important and that it was still very early to think about it
1	I proposed to go on and see how we 'd be doing
1	Then he said that for him it was very important , culturally and for paper
1	As he saw that I was reluctant he said that he actually did n't love me because he was in stress
1	If we got married stress would decrease and there would be a realistic chance that he would fall in love with me
1	I told him that this was emotional blackmailing and that getting married to him to wait for him to develop feelings which he 'd previously admitted while I had feelings for him was just too painful for me
1	This attempt to manipulate me into marriage was a big shock to me as I had experienced him very sweet before
1	Then he proposed that we just continue as before
1	I could n't sleep all night
1	I felt abused by the person I loved
1	I did n't know any more if what I had felt before was true or if I had made it all up
1	I called him next morning to separate
1	He did n't really comment , just said ok After that he was always on skype which he normally never was
1	It felt as if he was waiting for me to contact him
1	I did after some days
1	I asked him whether he wanted to talk
1	He did and we got back together again
1	His points were always that I did n't love him enough , otherwise I would rescue him and get married to him
1	At the same time he was saying that there was no love at all in the world and that he loved nobody and never will
1	His only love was at the age of 20 and was never fulfilled
1	He was putting himself down , counting the years he 'd left to live and complaining about his daily whisky and cigarette consumption , blaming it rather on his situation than on himself
1	So in a way he was asking me to get married to him not for love but to do him a favour because he was so miserable
1	He could just switch from one second to the other
1	After me being back home , he sent me lovely text messages
1	And I assured the feelings he expressed
1	So I asked him gently if he was scared about his feelings which he agreed upon
1	I proposed that he 'd have to let go his past , for him to replace his old memories with new happier ones
1	The conversation ended with him saying that he wanted to learn how to smile more
1	I was happy that somehow we seemed to have managed to not turn what felt like a depression into a fight
1	Next day I texted him about whether he 'd slept well and I wished him a good day
1	Then in the evening he skyped and the whole thing started again
1	If I 'd love him I 'd get married to him , etc
1	I 'm supposed to go away for a week
1	First he wanted to break up , then he proposed I should make up my mind till after my trip and call him if I wanted to get married to him
1	I told him that love is like a plant which needs water to bloom and that it wo n't grow if you 'd cut its leaves every week
1	His attitude is always take me or leave me
1	I guess the situation is a mix between the problems resulting from bpd and his personal difficult situation
1	I almost start questioning myself maybe he 's right and I should just get married to him because I love him
1	On the other hand I do n't like the way he treats me when he wants his will go through
1	And the after me giving in , would he be happy
1	Would n't there just be something else he 'd need me to do to prove my love to him
1	Well my girlfriend and I had been together for 2 years when it happened
1	I love her more than anything
1	We had initally broken up 6 months ago
1	She felt I was nt motivated enough and felt as though she was in a rut
1	I changed myself because I wanted to be more motivated and I was
1	When she took me back we were happier than ever
1	Well to tell this story right I first must say that i work at a bar
1	I found out that she liked me
1	anyway we started to talk and we exchanged IM 's
1	one night we were talking and I thought to myslef maybe I could get this girl to send me a naked pic since she likes me I know its stupid but it is what happened
1	So i was talking to her and trying to get her worked up
1	So i stopped the conversation and told the girl i do nt want to talk anymore
1	I went straight to my girlfriends house and told her what had happend
1	She first said that it was ok but later that night she told me how upset she was
1	two days later she sent me a text saying that she ca nt get over it and that we are done
1	its been a month now since we broke up and the days are still long and very difficult
1	All I do is think of her
1	I will go to the gym and hangout with friends but every night it all comes back to me
1	I know she loves me
1	She had told me in a text as much as I want to be with youmy brain tells me I desevre someone who does nt do that
1	I feel horrible for what i did
1	I casued her and myself so much pain
1	Hi I 'm sorry if this is about drawn out but I am struggling really badly with my health
1	I will bulletin my symptoms to make it eaiser all of these are not all at the same time but I suffer with it all badly
1	Ie I forgot my friends name took be 20 mins to remember it   • very painful knee joints
1	• I have polo cystic overies , hair growth on my face
1	To the point I have to shave it everyday • I 'm reckless with money and bad at remembering to pay bills I 'm in a right mess • abscesses
1	Over the last few days I 've seen a doctor about swollen glads in my groin and a very sore and itchy genitals
1	Last night I suffered with really bad uncontrollable shaking
1	I need help I never know what to say to a doctor and I clam up when there and forget it all
1	I 'm desperate now I feel like I am falling apart or going crazy
1	My stress is about my husband me being a stay at home mom finances and plus chasing my 20 month old around
1	I really just want a break but no one acts like it 's a big deal and I 'm made to feel like since I 'm a stay at home mom that I 'm not supposed to have a break
1	Honestly I would rather work a job then stay at home all day I find it more stressful and tiresome than working
1	I love being home and being a mother that takes care of her home and child soon to be children
1	I just wish that my 247 job was taking more serious
1	I feel more like a house slave then anything because not only am I picking up after myself and child I have to go in behind my husband and pick up his trash put food back in the fridge or throw whole packs of sandwich meat out
1	Clean up his clothes out of the floor or hair off the sink after he 's shaved
1	Plus we have a garden and I 'm expected to keep up with it too plus cook
1	It 's a lot of work especially when there is little help or when someone says I 'll get it and sits for 3 days waiting on him to get it
1	Sorry for complaining I just needed to get it out because I ca n't talk to him because he just tells me I 'm wrong and that he wished he had it easy
1	I have been experiencing some scary symptoms for several weeks now
1	The second has gone along with that original diagnosis and also said that my symptoms could be from allergies , recommending Claritin in the morning and Zantac and Benadryl at night to deal with my sleeping disturbances
1	In addition , if these did n't work , he gave me Lexapro to deal with anxiety
1	Also , sometimes as I was falling asleep , I would jerk and wake myself up I would also be scared because this seemed like something that should n't happen
1	It would take me a long time to get back to sleep when I woke up in the middle of the night
1	Sometimes it feels like there 's pressure in my sinuses , sometimes in the top of my head sometimes the pressure is on the left or right side of my head , sort of a headache
1	Finally , sometimes I shake , sometimes different muscles scattered around my body twitch a little fasciculations
1	I must add that there have been days when I have felt almost normal , and some days where I have felt pretty good most of the time
1	I started taking the Lexapro yesterday , 5 mg a day
1	This is affecting my ability to do my work properly I 'm 20 years old , living with my parents for the summer
1	My parents are unmoved by my symptoms and tell me to try to overcome it , but it 's hard when I am worried I might have a brain tumor
1	I have n't wanted to go to work , and I just do n't feel like myself
1	Another bad symptom I have n't gotten a good night of sleep in a long time
1	I 'm worried that this could be a brain tumor , though everyone around me insists it 's just anxiety mixed with allergies
1	I 'm scared and I do n't feel good at all
1	My supervisor came to me a few years ago telling me how unhappy he was and that he was going to leave his fiancéwe started seeing each other
1	Why she was still living with him he continued to tell me he broke up with her and was waiting for her to move outa year goes by and she leftthen we got into a huge fight and he 's telling me he was staying at his parents and here he was really living with hershe left to stay with her mother because she found out he was cheating on her
1	She came back and when we agreed to try and work on things once again he kept telling me he asked her to leave telling her things were not working out
1	But he did crazy things like give me a fake key to his house , he would break up with me every other daytell me he loves me then hates me
1	in the end I ended up talking to his fiancé and everything he had told me was a liehe never broke up with herhe was and had been working on everything with herhe would go out with me then go home telling me he was going home to bed , but would be spending time with her when he told me she was packing her things to leave once again
1	In the end I went to hr at work and explained we had a relationship and it turned bad and it was uncomfortableI asked him numerous times to go with me
1	He ended up getting fired and he was there a very very long time
1	I never meant for that to happen I figured they would switch one of our job titles
1	I just feel guiltyeven though he emotionally abused me I still feel bad
1	I have n't talked to him in almost a month , he changed his number
1	I just feel so guilty he lost his job
1	I do feel like he will never talk to me again
1	I did n't mean to hurt him this way
1	I sent him a couple emails apologizing and he did respond once saying he pretty much Hates me
1	I thought of this person as my best friend
1	I know it 's not healthy but in some way I wish he would talk to me again and I do n't think he ever will
1	i am 49 12 years old
1	I have no uterusbut i have both ovaries
1	I take promethreum 8 days a monthsupposed to be days 18 to 25but it is a little hard for me to judge since i do n't have a period to go by
1	i take it when my breasts starte to get tenderwhich happens on a fairly regular basisso i know i still have some sort of cycle
1	I am dealing with such horrible depression and anxiety there are days that i just want to cease to exist
1	i have not been able to get my sex hormones tested because the doc says they need to be tested during a certain time during your cycle to be rightbut i ca n't figure out when that time is without a period to go by
1	I would be willing to have my sex hormones tested every week for 46 weeks if it would halp to give some kind of idea of what my body is doingI have really good insurance coverage for blood work
1	My testosterone was low in the past and i was put on a testosterone cream
1	My DHEA was also low and i used to take 25 mgs
1	My new doc told me that was a mans ' dose and told me to take 10 mgsthen he did blood work and my DHEA was only about 10he said it should be around 280so he had me up the DHEA to 20 mgs
1	If anyone could shed some light on things and educate me a little more on endocrine issues and sex hormone imbalances I would greatly appreciate it
1	Hello all , My girlfriend was admitted to a behavioral health unit at our local hospital because she said she was suicidal during a panic attack
1	She was there for a few days and had panic the whole time because the environment was scary
1	To help with the side effects they gave here Geodon because she was having psychosis during the attacks which is the only time she has signs of psychosis
1	They started her on 20 mg the first day , 40 mg the next and then when she checked out they gave her a full script at 60 mg
1	Yesterday she woke up in the morning , was able to call the doc only for him to say that since she was n't his patient any more there was nothing he could do
1	She was doing okay in the morning , a little slow but better
1	After we drove around got a little food in her , around 3 pm she started getting confused and it was a downward spiral the rest of the evening until she just flat fell asleep
1	This morning she woke up was feeling quite a bit better , able to get around still a little confused , but knew what she wanted
1	Around 12 she decided to take a nap because she was feeling exhausted She woke up around 4 and was extremely confused and made me turn the tv because it was all just too much
1	We had such hope after this morning but now she says that mentally this afternoon has been the worst
1	It 's been four days since she took the last one
1	She feels as if there is no end , I know by reading others experiences that is a common theme but how much longer will she have to endure this
1	She only took the medicinepoison for three days
1	Also why is it that she seems so much better in the mornings but when the afternoon hits things go downhill
1	I know this is asking a lot of questions but we are at a loss now
1	While she was there they started her on 50 mg Zoloft and upped her Klon from 5 mg to 1 mg
1	Thank god for the Zoloft and the 1 mg Klon , otherwise it would be all of this and panic attacks since she is so scared

1	I am 15 years old , just began my sophomore year of high school
1	As long as I can remember , I have had problems sleeping
1	When I was younger I would repeatedly walk around my house and lock all of the windows and doors , I would lock my bedroom door and my bathroom door and shove blankets under my curtains to prevent strangers from peering into my bedroom
1	I would have my parents sit outside of my room until I fell asleep
1	This was all when I was 510 years old
1	I would also hallucinate and see floating orbs of energy and ghostly figures around my house
1	Those have stopped , but I still stay up at night shaking and crying from the noises I hear around the house , I still methodically lock the windows and doors
1	When I was in middle school I was bullied severely and my parents did n't believe me , I was alone
1	I became extremely depressed , I cut and attempted suicide a countless number of times
1	Whenever I told my parents about my feelings they would yell at me , call me a freak
1	So , I stopped telling them things
1	In 8th grade I stopped cutting because I had gotten arrested and when I showed my mom the 60 cuts on my hips , she told me I was a disgrace
1	I have selfdiagnosed myself with depression and I have been living with it for 4 years
1	The paranoia has not stopped , when I am awake , I am terrified
1	When I am asleep , I have horrible nightmares
1	At this very moment I hear creaking noises and I am panicking
1	I ca nt tell my parents this , if I do they will realize that I am not their perfect child
1	They will ridicule me and degrade me
1	I do n't know what is wrong with me , but I want to know
1	I need to know what the cause of this 15 year phobia is
1	Well after an amazing day with hanging out with Campus Outreach , I decided to hang with a friend
1	JD and I have been friends for about a year in a half
1	He struggled with sexual stuff that he never told me about and at the time at had very little self respect for myself because of a bunch of bad relationships and such
1	One day I got very suicidal and he decided to help me and well that brought us close
1	We started spending all of our time together , but soon things started getting out of control with us
1	He would start kissing me and then his hands would roam and that progressed and then it got to where I would be scared because when I would tell him to stop it would be like he was in his own little world and he just did n't hear me
1	I just was n't sure what to do and it got to the point where I thought he was going to rape me because he just did n't seem to hear me when He got going
1	We thought about dating but decided not to because we knew it would be a bad relationship
1	Then he started avoided me even when I was just saying hi and then he got back with his exgirlfriend
1	It hurt me so bad emotionally that I went pretty off the edge shortly after that I went into a mania and it was bad and lasted for the rest of my school semester
1	We did n't talk to each other again til the summer when he emailed me to apologize for his actions and tell me that he had a problem
1	We slowly got our friendship back and he had a girl friend who was keeping him in control
1	We decided not to hang with each other until we were ready
1	Well about 2 weeks ago he was like lets hang out and I was like I do n't think that 's a good idea and I told him that I was scared of what would happen between us alone
1	For 2 weeks he kept giving me reason why hanging out this time would be okay because nothing would happen
1	Well at first the hanging out was going well but then he started tickling me and then he started kissing me and it progressed and I could n't get him to stop but he realized what he was doing and he stopped and it shook me up so bad that I was stuttering when I talked and I honestly did n't know what to do
1	then he started talking and we talked and started back looking at the videos and he went to hug me and he kissed me again and his hands automatically started roaming again and I jumped up and I almost threwup it was too much for me emotionally and physicallymy mood automatically changed and I just could n't talk he asked me question for like an hour but I just could n't answer something about the whole situation scared the hell out of me and I wanted to cry but the tears would n't come and then I just wanted to dieI felt guilty and like a   because I just gave up on trying to stop him and let him do stuff to me I wanted to take my pocket knife and split my wrist and just bleed to death and then my emotions went completely numbI became unresponsive for what had to be an hour or more and then he apologize and said he should have listened to me when I said that it would be a bad idea
1	Then he hugged me but even when he hugged me he hugged me to long and then his hands started to roam and it brought back bad memories of when I was a child and molested
1	This whole situation didI do n't know what to do how to respond to it and I know I hurt his feelings by just not talking to him
1	I just am not sure how to shake this feeling that I was just remolested when that s something that happened in my childhood
1	He kept asking me what was wrong but I could n't tell him that he reminded me of my molestor when I was a child
1	I feel like the whole situation was my fault and I should n't have gave in to him coming to hang out in my dorm
1	Recently , my mom has been calling me but I have refused to take her calls
1	I feel guilty about doing this but here 's why I have refused to pick up the phone
1	Last summer , my mom and I had a huge argument and it did n't end very well
1	She hung up on me but not before saying things like comparing me to other people
1	She 's done this all my life but it was n't until I made myself look up some reputable websites that her behavior was n't ok
1	So I made up my mind then that she would never get away with hurting me like that ever again
1	So that 's why I have n't been picking up the phone but I have n't felt good about doing this since it 's my first time that I 've conscientiously decided not to do so
1	Under the advice of one of my friends , I talked to my dad about the problem and hoped that he would help but he did n't
1	He was n't mean about responding to me but the gist of his response was that I brought the problem on myself because I would n't do what my mom wanted
1	In case anyone wants to know what my mom wanted from me , she wanted me to go into medicinescience , get married but to a Korean manshe 's extremely against me marrying African Americans , which I find very disturbing , etc
1	Growing up , I did what she wanted until I entered university
1	It was in university that I lost my way
1	I was under a lot of stress and did n't end up graduating university , although my parents do n't know that
1	So now , although I 'm living halfway around the world away from my mom , she can find ways to contact me
1	I am ok with emails as long as they 're short and to the point
1	I do n't tell my mom anything that I think she could use to attack me which is why she makes those comparisons to other people
1	I 'm 33 years old and living with my dad and grandmother
1	My dad and mom are still married but because of work , my dad has to be away from her most of the year
1	I 'm not in any relationship but I do n't want to be married for the sake of being married or to make my mom happy
1	I do n't like her idea of a husband since it sounds too traditional and racist for me to take
1	I 'd rather be single for the rest of my life
1	And because of her , I do n't want to have any children ever but if I am so unfortunate as to have kids , I would n't ever let them near her , especially if I thought that she would treat them the same way she treated me
1	I know that I 've made my mom sound like some sort of monster although she is n't all the time
1	I do think she is too nosy , and verbally abusive when she does n't get her way
1	I tried to tell her all this calmly several years ago but she refused to listen
1	And there are times that I 've been depressed but my mom would call me a liar since I did n't try to commit suicide
1	I know I 've made a mess of my life and I want to start fresh but I feel that I ca n't as long as I have my mom around to verbally abuse me
1	I 've told some of my friends about this and they 've been a good support
1	First , I want to know if my mom has been abusing me
1	I feel stupid that I did n't pick up on this when I was a child
1	I could have sought counseling or something if I had realized that her behavior was n't acceptable
1	Also , I want to know if continuing to ignore basically , not answering her calls is the right thing to do
1	It 's been over a year since our last phone conversation but I do n't have enough emotional strength to deal with talking to her again
1	My heart starts pounding uncontrollably and it takes a while before I can calm down
1	I do feel like I messed up my life and although I am working now part time , I do want to go back to school but I do n't have enough money and I would n't qualify for any of the loan programs that are out there
1	If there was a scholarship to help people like me who have been in an abusive relationship to get them back on their feet , I 'd be very grateful
1	I was diagnosed with bpd in my teens , but as the years went by I seemed to tuck it far into my recognition
1	I am now in my early 30s and in therapy I mentioned that I was looking for a group to start with , she recommended DBT
1	She said that it is primarily for people diagnosed with bpd , but she felt it would help me
1	That sparked something in my memory that I was already diagnosed with it , so I began doing a lot of research on thisWow , I AM
1	For the past 15 years or so , I just thought I was miserable person
1	OKso my question to all of you isNow that I can admit that I am borderline , my husband uses it against me
1	If I approach him on something that bothers me , he will say its your borderline making you feel this way , etc Maybe he is right on some things , but not everything
1	He has a passcode on his cell that I do n't know and he wo n't tell me it
1	He says that it is his personal space and he does n't feel I have the right any longer to look through his stuff   I always had a snooping problem because I do n't trust
1	So last night I stated that I feel very uneasy regarding that , he got furious and said and turned it back on me
1	My borderline only seems to affect me and my husband , no one else sees it
1	They all feel he 's the bad guy , he 's controlling , jelous , mean at times , and he feels he 's ALWAYS right
1	I 'm now 17 years old , and a year ago I finally opened up and told my mom about the sexual abuse I went through as a kid
1	Apparently it 's been classified as rapeand as I have started to remember some suppressed memories I can see why
1	My problem is that it all started off well , I started seeing a therapist , went to the police with my mom and told my story
1	But it 's now one year later and I ca n't even bare it anymore
1	The issues are still , I have a huge fear of touching people , or whenever someone touches me I ca n't stop myself to flinch
1	And many do n't know why I do that so they punish me with hurtful words or with jokes that really are n't that funny
1	But I ca n't help it , I 'm really trying to change
1	The crying and anxiety is back , every morning at school I have to rush to the bathroom and sit there for 15 minutes before I can calm myself down
1	And I 've stopped caring , i do nt care what people or teachers require from me anymoreI'm so exhausted
1	I am 21 years old , i have been battleing anxiety and panic attacks since about 14 i used to be on antidepressants for it but back then never really had a ride to mental help to talk to someone so i just stopped taking me meds and everything well i have a child now and she is almost a year old my whole pregnancy i only got one panic attack and it did nt last to long but since i ve had her i have them all the time and they just keep getting worse and worse so i will drink to self medicate myself but i never drink enough to where i ca nt take care of my daughter and when i put her to bed i drink myself to sleep i ve been to mental health again not to long ago to be evaluated and i told them about my anxiety and that i drink everyday to deal with it they just told me to stop drinking and do breatheing exercises but that does help i ca nt stop drinking or its worse and i am just so hopeless right now i have my boyfriend that helps me take care of our daughter but i ca nt do this anymore i used to have a bad cutting problem but i stopped for my daughter and right now i feel like that is my only way to get help and for someone to take me seriously my panic attacks are slowly killing me i ca nt take it like i just want to call an er right now and tell them i need help but i do nt want my daughter to get taken away from me i do nt want to lose her what should i do
1	Dear Doctor , I was recently hospitalized for severe depression and panic disorder , and am currently in an outpatient CBT program at the same hospital   the program is terrific and I 'm learning a great deal
1	The problem is medication   I 'm hugely sensitive to drugs and virtually every SSRI or SSNRI I 've tried   Cymbalta , LexaPro , and now Zoloft   really exacerbates the anxiety
1	I 'm still anxious and fearful , but also incredibly fatigued , sleeping a great deal , and   here 's the worst part   have had severe diarrhea for 3 weeks
1	We 've tried tapering the Zoloft from 150 down to 100 mg , but the diarrhea is just as bad
1	I so much want to get well my doc understands that , and is also emphatic that my depression is severe and that I really need to be on an antidepressant for a long time
1	My body reacts tho them as if they are speed
1	Even before I got sick , I could n't even handle drinking a cup of coffee   it was too stimulating
1	I 'm in my 40s and need to be able to think clearly , and want to accomplish a lot more and get through this
1	Thank you for your help
1	This is ' so he can catch up ' as he feels I am a better dancer
1	Her husband finds out , files for divorce , and my husband gets a summons in the mail to appear at THEIR divorce hearing as a witness
1	Their relationship ends abruptly when I confront him
1	Now I do n't trust him
1	One afternoon I come home and Husband picks a fight
1	always been an issue for him Mid fight , he tells me he has found someone else
1	I proceeded to take my wedding ring off , throw it at him , and then punched him in the jaw
1	uncool , very uncool As I tried to leave the house , he follows me and physically tries to stop me from leaving
1	Oldest son pulls his dad off me so I can get away , then drives to local pd , files a report , and then the police start looking for him
1	i did n't know this at the time but he had hit my oldest son
1	His father dies He turns nasty and self centered
1	He had an affair with her while she was married AND representing him
1	It 's been two years and we still have n't been able to get a date with the judge
1	Mostly due to the fact that SHE finally withdrew representation , HE decided to represent himselfwith the loving advice from his mistress the LAWYERand now has finally gotten a male attorney to represent him
1	This is the first time I have told my story and I thank you for reading it
1	As both my boys have told me at one time or another'Mom , you 're the strongest person I knowdeep down I know they are right
1	Hello , I had some concerns about getting off Zoloft
1	At my most dependant I was on 250 mg and over the past 2 years I have weened myself down to 25 mg
1	I am taking it crazy slow because about a year ago I tried to come down and got so anxious and depressed that I went back up to 50 mg which I am aware is an incredibly low dose
1	I see a psychotherapist once a week and we talk about my concerns and anxietydepression
1	I notice that at this 25 mg dose I get these crazy low moments where I feel like the world is just turning in on me
1	I have been learning to meditate to help with the anxiety and I do practice yoga 34x a week
1	I have a healthy diet and do not drink too much caffeine because that does add to my anxiety
1	Anyway , I 'm wondering if these anxioussad feelings are because I have been on Zoloft for 17 years put on when I was 1315 yrs old and my body is just not accustomed to the low dose
1	I hate talking to the psychiatrist because her great plan is to stay on for life bla bla bla and all doctors I see are always pushing the same but I would love to try and power through this if I know there 's hope that all this WILL GET BETTER and I just need to keep on
1	One more mention I havedo take some natural mood elevators like omega 3s , krill oil , HTTP 5 , cromiumall the good stuff
1	I 'm a graduate student in architecture and I constantly find myself getting extremely angry over the smallest things
1	I do n't want to blame it on my past house fire in 6th grade   lost everything including my dog and other pets , parents divorce in high school , oldest of four and try to lead by example , but they may have led to my reactions , who knows
1	This is more specifically directed at the anger I feel and my reactions toward my girlfriend who is in Spain right now
1	I have never physically harmed her , but I have gotten her upset at my constant need of her attention and approval
1	I am jealous of any guy she meets or talks to
1	I get upset when I do n't get immediate responses when we are talking online ie
1	I often feel insecure I constantly need to hear I misslove you
1	She displays her emotions a lot less than I do which discourages me
1	I am still always trying to impress her , though she says we 're past that stage
1	I am a hopeless romantic , and she says she 's not into the fairytale world I believe I live in delusional
1	I always feel that if I do n't have her constant and consistent attention , then I will lose her to another person
1	At this point I get very angry because I ca n't control my emotions and end up making things worse
1	I tell her she 's not on an equal level of commitment , that she would n't make the same sacrifices for me as I would for her , and that she needs to try harder to show me these emotions
1	She reacts by saying that she does make sacrifices and such , but that it 's never enough to make me satisfied
1	I even feel that she puts Facebook damn its creation ahead of me
1	However , I am also a jealous , attentionstarved , depressed , perfectionist who is afraid that he will lose the girl he loves if he keeps reacting this way
1	I 've been dating my bf for 2 yrs in a long distance relationship and he ended our relationship to go back to his ex
1	We both are 21 now and he had dated her for 4 years long distance in highschool
1	They broke up after he caught her cheating on him in person when visiting
1	Although we were friends in highschool , I was n't in contact with him for the last few months of his relationship with her where I really supported him when he felt the worstbetrayed
1	However , we began talking again as friends and he would vent to me about the breakup
1	We began dating a few months after their breakup   I made sure he was over his ex before beginning the relationship
1	Things were great for 15 years even though his ex was now attending the same college as him   we were long distance
1	But suddenly he started doubting the trust we built , citing my social media profiles as problems and who I was having dinner with even though I remained completely faithful
1	We fought over this bc I restricted myself out of sake of the relationship but he did n't reciprocate the actions I took
1	He started distancing himself from me , making excuses that he was busy , could n't vid chat , short text replies , etc
1	then I discovered 2 pics of him on diff
1	instances in a group standing with his ex which I blew up about but his excuse was he happened to see her there with mutual friends and was forced to take the pic
1	He had lied to me about being at that event altogether
1	After all this drama , he finally admitted to cheating with me a year ago with his ex
1	This was probably why he was n't trusting me bc he cheated behind my back
1	I was extremely pissed off knowing that he cheated me after having been through getting cheated on by his ex
1	After 2 weeks of no contact , he wanted me back and felt guilty of having cheatedtreating me badly
1	I was naive enough to give it a second chance but I brought up the doubt I had for him many times bc I needed to tell him how I felt
1	During our rel , he had told me he did not talk to his ex unless for emergencies
1	Once all this happened , I asked him to not talk to his ex at all like he said he would do earlier in the rel which he said he could n't do for me anymore
1	A few days later , he basically ended the rel saying he needed space but when I questioned him further he said he was too busy to keep up our rel , he did n't think it would work out , then finally stated he 's gon na go back to his ex
1	Since then I have been in no contact with him for 20 days
1	My questions are how can I deal with this situation
1	I loved him a lot and we both could see us together but did he ever love me
1	Why did this he choose to go back when I was completely faithfulgood to him but his ex has cheated
1	I feel that the reason he went back is because now he can have a rel that 's not long distance with her
1	Will they still have all the problems he discussed with me after their breakup
1	How can he end our friendshiprelationship and move directly back with her without a grieving period
1	I feel so used and it 's the reason for my anxiety the past month
1	I 'm afraid of seeing them together happyeventually married one day
1	Will they really last given that after graduation they could be in different cities
1	I 'm wondering if anyone can help me with something a bit odd that goes on with my thoughts
1	I 'm already diagnosed BiPolar II , but am controlling it pretty well now with cognitive behavioural therapy
1	But there 's a weird thought process I have that I 've never mentioned to my psychiatrist because I 'm just so used to it I barely notice myself doing it
1	Today is my birthday , and when I asked my boyfriend if we could go to a particular place he replied whatever you like babe
1	I then had to take just a second to make sure the people in my head understood that it 's my birthday and I 'm not a spoiled cow who just gets her way all the time
1	It 's not voices , as such , in the sense that there 's no internal sentence like it 's my birthday , I 'm not just a cow   it 's difficult to explain , but it 's sort of like I have to actively think about the fact that it 's my birthday so the other people they 're not specific people , just faceless nonindividuals will pick up on me thinking it and understand
1	In the same way the other people do n't speak , as such   I 'm just very aware sometimes of what they 're thinking about , and occasionally I have to deliberately and slowly run through a particular thought process so they 'll know what I know and understand why I 'm doing or saying a particular thing
1	I 'm only aware of this process maybe a couple of times a day , but I suspect it 's almost constant without me really registering it
1	I obviously looked blank for a couple of seconds on this occasion because my boyfriend asked me what I was thinking about I told him and he actually looked quite alarmed , hence my asking you about it here
1	I do KNOW the people who are watching me are n't real , it 's just that very occasionally I have to remind myself of that I 'll find myself standing a particular way in the shower to make me look better pulling my stomach in or whatever , and once I realise that 's what I 'm doing I have to kind of tell myself there are n't really people watching me
1	I never have a problem convincing myself they 're not real , though , if that tells you anything
1	At this point I 'm not conscious of the other people affecting me in any significant or negative way , and the people have been with me for as long as I can remember
1	It 's only now I 'm trying to work out how to explain it to you that I 'm realising it does actually sound pretty strange   I just never thought about it before , but I 'll have to pay more attention and see if I notice them stopping me doing things I want to or anything
1	My ex was very abusive and left me totally traumatised
1	I found out that he also tried to murder his exwife when i finally got away from him
1	By the time i had recovered from PTSD , I reported his abuse to the police but it was too late for him to be arrested
1	It was also very hurtful that one or two mutual friends Only a year or so later , he is happily married to a lovely lady
1	I contacted her on facebook , assuming he would be abusive to her too
1	Only apparently he is lovely and kind and gentle to her
1	Also , people who did nt know me very well at the time , and did nt really want to believe he did all this , and his family , can now just say i was crazy and made it all up
1	I find it so hard to get over what he did to me which included taking me captive for 4 days in his house , taking away my phone , attempting to strangle me , threatening me with a big knife when i said i wanted to go home and interrogating me about my exboyfriends using scientology techniques against my will
1	I always thought one day he would abuse again , and then i would help that girl go to the police and there would be justice
1	But it is nt , he 's just somehow changed and they 're blissfully married
1	I am 18 getting ready to turn 19 in July
1	When I was 17 my father basically wanted me to have sex with him and not tell anyone
1	I went home and told my mother
1	She looked astonished and me and her went to go confront him
1	He said , Who are u gona believe me or your daughter
1	When my older sister was 12 our father did the same thing but he was saying sexual explicit things to her for about 2 months
1	She came foward and told my ma in about 2002 , and nothing still happened
1	He is not a father in my eyes
1	He thought that me and my brother were doings things
1	He hurt me mentally , physically , and most of all emmotionally
1	Me and my sister went to the police but basically they said that its nothing that we can do
1	I used to hate him with every single fiber in me
1	I used to get into heated arguments with him
1	Then i realized that he 's not worth it so i calmed down eventually
1	I feel him almost watching or undressing me with his eyes
1	I hate it when my nieces comes over because I do nt trust him around them so i look after them 247 when they come ova
1	But i know in my heart that GOD will punish him for his wrongdoings
1	I used to get nightmares of me and him doing things because of what he wanted to do with me
1	Not just me , he did that to my older sister too
1	I know I m stronger thatn him , he is the devil
1	He is just an evil spirit that I refuse to win me ova or my sister
1	My only problem is to forgive himwhat should I do
1	I am 22 and have a 3 year old and am currently 15 weeks pregnant with my second child
1	Approximately 9 months ago I moved in with my fiancé , his grand mother , mother , and 14 year old cousin His cousin and I have had a sister type relationship until recently
1	When she was less than 6 months old , her mother committed suicide and her dad has been incarcerated her whole life , and her grandmother has been raising her
1	But about two weeks ago her grandmother was involved in an altercation that lead to her shooting and killing a man , leaving me , my fiancé , and her drunk of an aunt to care for her so pretty much just ME seeing my fiancé is at work all the time
1	Since I have lived here I have done so much for her such as buy her an iPhone and take her to get her hairnails done on a daily basis Help her with homework , etc And just last week we decided that after the Christmas break we would home school her due to bullying over the incident with her grandma so we bought her a brand new 500 HP Laptop
1	She has been slacking with helping around the house and has been quite depressed , but given the situation , I allowed her to slack and gather her emotions
1	I created a chore list that left me with majority of the responsibilities and her just having to do as least as possible
1	Well now she is failing school and being a brat and I 'm at my wits end
1	This morning after I told her to ride the bus , as I am sick and did n't want to get out in the cold to bring her to school , she went behind my back after I fell asleep and had my fiancé bring her to school
1	I 'm so upset and lost because I do n't know how to raise a teenager
1	I shut off her phone just an hour again in hopes of it changing her attitude but I 'm not sure this will work
1	I 'm worried it will just anger her and make her resent me and not change her behavior What else should I do
1	Today is just a really bad day for me , I just feel blah
1	I do n't even know why and that 's frustrating me even more
1	I 'm stressed at home and then I come to work and there 's more stress here , its so irritating because I put on a happy face and try to get through the day but its so difficult
1	I 've had two pretty big anxiety attacks and when that happens its so embarrassing because I begin to cry for no reason and I have to try to hide it from people so they do n't think I 'm losing it or something
1	I 'm not happy w my job but then again I do n't know what I want to do , I feel so lost like I do n't even know who I am
1	I think of all these things that I would want to do and then I remember that I do n't have the ability to do it or rather I believe I do n't have the ability to do it
1	I just want to get to a point in my life where I 'm genuinely happy , but I 'm afraid that may never happen
1	I feel the same now that I felt before I started my medication over a year ago , so I stopped taking it
1	I 'm so lost I do n't know what to do
1	I was put on Klonopin for a misdiagnosis of epilepsy
1	I was on it for 8 years 20002008 and during that time , the side effect of the Klonopin was misdiagnosed as depression and I was put on Zoloft , Effexor , and eventually Seroquel as well
1	Once it was determined that I did not have epilepsy , I was taken off the Klonopin coldturkey
1	I still have some withdrawal symptoms , but also developed involuntary tongue movement and as that can be connected to antipsychotics , which Seroqeul is , I began to taper off of that drug about a month ago with no return of disturbed mood
1	But now I read that antidepressants can also cause involuntary tongue movements and I want off all of these drugs as soon as is safely possible
1	My husband and i been together 5yrs married 2yr
1	Ever since we got married he has changed into a different person
1	I like the ideal of him having control and being the man of the house but for the last yr he has became hard to deal with
1	He cusses me , yells at me , tells me to learn to be his wife , i need to do what i m told , and be a better mother
1	I try to not argue with him but he constantly pushing my buttons to make me cry
1	I 've got to the point where i do nt even know what to say to him , i m afraid I 'll say it wrong and he will take it the wrong way
1	I has gotten so bad one day that i felt i could n't take it no longer and i hit him to get him to stop
1	I kept telling him over the past yr to stop
1	I feel bad that i hit him cause I truly love my husband but now he wants a divorce
1	He said it was over the day i put my hands on him
1	We have n't saw each other in 3 months
1	Why ca n't he see what happened that day was from something that was building up over time
1	I 've said him over and over to stop
1	My 32 year old daughter has given me 2 wonderful grandsons ages 2 and 3 by her long time boyfriend , who is obviously suffering from some type of paranoia
1	His father is a diagnosed Sociopath , his father got him addicted to crystal meth when he was 13 years old , he is now 33
1	He is undiagnosed but he believes the rest of the world talks in code , and often his obsession is learning the code so that he can know what people really mean when they say something
1	My daughter has recently told him until he seeks medical help for his addiction and mental problems she does not want contact with him
1	He is calling the police at all hours of the night and somehow getting them to come to our house my daughter lives with my husband and I to check if she is alive
1	In the 8 years they have been together he has gotten many very good jobs , because he is very talented and intelligent , but he can not hold them longer than a couple of weeks because he always believes they are conspiring against him so he ends up quitting
1	He recently has gotten worse and tried to run her off the road with his car
1	My 3 year old grandson said why is daddy trying to kill us
1	My daughter included this incident and the 118 text messages of his ranting 's that were obviously delusional in a restraining order request
1	I fear for him and I fear for her
1	His mother also tried to get him committed when the police arrived there at his house they said they woke him up and he convinced them that all his phone calls to the police was just a genuine concern for my daughter
1	Even though he had been to our house several times that day and seen her alive and well , he still called the police and told them he thinks something has happened to her
1	We have tried everything we know , I can not sleep with worry about where this is going to go
1	We can not get a protective order his mother tried and failed to get him evaluated , and he does not think anything is wrong with him
1	Where can I go what can I do , how can we convince him to get help
1	My father was a diagnosed Paranoid Schizophrenic , when I was 4 years old I remember being in the car with my siblings all screaming and crying because my Dad said he was going to drive us all into the lake
1	I have great fears that because my daughters ex boyfriend is fixated on her and the kids that he will harm them
1	Just joined and not sure if this is the proper forum but I have an 18 yo daughter that has been horribly angry since she popped her head out the day she was born
1	I see a lot of me in her and was just diagnosed with bipolar , ADD and PTSD which should have nothing to do with her anger issuesI grew out of my anger but burned a lot of bridges along the way and would appreciate any advice from anyone that has a child that has dealt with anger issues with successor even yourselfI would like to nip it in the bud as she has so much potential
1	She is beautiful and I say that because it is not her self esteemof course I think all my kids are beautiful because they are mine but in reality , to you , maybe not
1	So when I say she is beautiful , she IS on the outside
1	She was always the one that was stopped and told how gorgeous she was , even with my other children in tow but can be very mean and hurtful and her outbursts are just intolerable
1	Because she received so much attention I subconsciously tended to favor her sister because I felt bad and did not want her to grow up feeling lesser than yes , I know it is n't important but tell that to a 12 year old girlany preteen , teenage girl
1	Consequently she is very jealous of her older sister because she blossomed into a beautiful young woman , has lots of GREAT friends , goes to a prominent University , makes good choices and has herself together
1	Ana , on the other hand , is mad as heck and blames me for her hopeless life , etc
1	So , my question is should my dad choose to start with a surgery or a general chemotherapy
1	I 'm a thirteen year old girl
1	When I 'm on my period , I do not get cramps at all
1	hallelujah while I 'm glad of that , my emotions lose control
1	I am the saddest I 've ever been in that time , although I 'm great at hiding it
1	I got my first period a little over a year ago
1	I 'm aware I have a very long way to go before menopause , but I 'm sick of constantly feeling horrible for no reason
1	I think I am very fortunate in many aspects of my life and I 'm extremely grateful , but the happiness I should feel is nowhere to be found during that time of the month
1	Yes , I know not having cramps is a great thing , but I would rather be genuinely happy and in indescribable pain than feeling my worst along with the frustration of not knowing why
1	I know it 's just hormones , but I want my hormones to be 10x less crazy
1	I feel as though I could cry for hours and hours , and I go to bed at either 600 pm or 500 am
1	during my period , I could not possibly hate my body , hair , skin , eyes , style , or anything else more
1	My boyfriend of one year and I have gone through a tumultuous relationship this past year
1	I started dating him out of desperation for a business partner without even realizing it
1	He fed into my delusion by being extremely interested in the business at the time
1	He told me everything I wanted to hear without knowing I was mentally blowing it out of proportion without him knowing and I created this fantasy that we were absolutely perfect and unstoppable
1	I fell in love with him and we had amazing times together , no one in the world is more fun , sweet , funny or pure than he and I love him
1	A few months later he realized involvement in my business was not what he wanted and I was insanely upset and afraid
1	I could n't handle it and would react angrily toward him when the subject came up
1	I became verbally and emotionally abusive toward him without even realizing
1	He never told me how he felt due to fear of losing me
1	One minute I was fun loving and normal , the second something about business came up I would get very angry and tell him how angry I was in a really mean way with the limits of no swearing , yelling , hitting or name calling
1	Deep down I really loved him , I was just very scared and angry and pretty confused on why
1	But I continued to nagg and provoke and argue with him , which I did n't even realize was deeply hurting and confusing him
1	This went on for a couple months until my anger got so hot I could n't handle or make sense of it
1	It made no logical sense to me cause although he accepted the blame I knew he was innocent and did n't deserve it
1	I told him how I could n't make sense of my anger and he really had n't done anything although he said he did and wanted to figure it out
1	I asked him to take a week long break from eachother to gather our thoughts and see how we felt having no contact
1	During that week to myself I realized everything I had done to him
1	I told him I have realized what I was doing and am so ashamed I feel nauseous
1	I feel so sick inside like I do n't want to eat , I have this constant stomach and head ache
1	I ca n't stop crying and saying I 'm sorry and do n't deserve his forgiveness
1	He forgives me and I feel soo unworthy , I lost 7 pounds in the past couple days and ca n't stop thinking about all the mean things I said
1	I can tell he is hurt after our realization and feel like giving him permission to do something to hurt me
1	I am so sorry and cry everytime I think of how kind and patient he 's been and told him I would n't even have forgiven me
1	What can I do to make him feel better
1	Should I give him permission to cheat on me or do something hurtful so I can feel the way he did
1	I have n't seen him since we took the break , so it 's been a little over a week
1	Although I miss him I 'm scared to see him cause I cry simply thinking of him , I will be a blubbering fool in person
1	What can I do to get him even with me
1	I have been seeing the same person 5 years mostly consistent
1	we have broken up for two weeks at the most with out talking
1	The longest we were separated was around nine months , when I dated someone else
1	When I broke up with him to see someone else he came back in two weeks and I just dated two guys
1	We have been building each other up and tearing one another down for years
1	The problem now is it is over and I feel as though I have lost a lover and my best friend
1	I feel as though someone has died very close to me
1	We broke up the day after Christmas and every day I have done something to make it worse
1	I do n't know how to turn off loving him
1	I sleep and dream that we are ok and I wake up to the opposite
1	He has me currently blocked from everything
1	The day after Christmas was a really bad fight we fought physically and he broke two phones with two year contracts in my name
1	He is the one with the car who was driving me to work
1	Yesterday I found out that the waitress I was always worried that he would cheat on me for was talking to him
1	I did n't want to do anything about it , but I made everything worse
1	The waitress for the time being does not want to sleep with him , but I am sure they will patch things upI have nearly lost my job because I have been too stressed to sit still in the call center where I work
1	I have isolated myself , partially because we were always together and there was n't much need to spend time with a lot of other people and partially because all I want to talk about is this break up
1	I am heartbroken I am afraid of making things worse further
1	I can not stand to think that he will be happier than me and I can not figure out how to make myself happy
1	I need to know how to pick up and keep going , because I am sure he is never coming back
1	I have acted so pathetically and crazy At this point he has told me that he hates me and hopes I die
1	I have said it to him
1	I know I do n't mean it
1	I just know that it is over , and I do n't know what to do next
1	I do n't know but when I stood in front of an ordain man of the cloth that meant something to me
1	We took vows in front of god to god to forever be faithful and loving in sickness an in health good times an bad times till death do we part
1	ANd I stand by those vows but I 'm not so sure my wife is or will
1	That up to her I guess
1	Yet its a catch 22 if she would n't Have married me I would n't have two great kids but now its got down hill and there going to pay
1	So I can say I wish she would n't have married me
1	But then I would n't have them
1	Sorry for rambling just looking for anyones input on commitment please and how they feel about it this whole world ca n't be that messed up I hope
1	My boyfriend of 15 years deals with chronic depression
1	When he goes through these bouts he insists he needs to untangle things alone
1	I have my own mental health issues I struggle with , but we deal with things in very different ways
1	Sometimes I feel like I 'm failing him when I step aside and and let him cope with things , but when I try to step in and offer support or assistance I think he feels like I 'm trying to fix him , or like he is letting me down or failing me in some way
1	I do n't even really know why I 'm posting except to look for advice andor support
1	I ca n't turn to him because he is using all of his energy to work through what he is dealing with , I do n't feel like I can open up to our friends because I do n't want to betray his trust by talking about personal issues that are really his to open up about
1	I also feel like a really selfish person because I struggle during these instance too the distance he creates , the lack of affection , and feeling like everything I do and say is wrong and like nothing can reach him is so hard sometimes
1	It feels so personal even though I know this mental struggle has nothing to do with me
1	For those of you who struggle withhave partners who deal with similar issues or cope in similar ways , what is the best advice you can give me on how to be a good and supportive partner and friend during these times
1	So I found out today at 18 years old that my brother tried to molest me before I turned 3 years old
1	He was 7 at the time
1	As soon as my aunt informed me , the memory came flooding back
1	I do not remember everything , I do n't remember him touching me
1	But I do remember him making me lay down in bed with him and moving my hand repeatedly toward his privates
1	My aunt said that my uncle walked in on him fondling me
1	I remember inappropriate behavior continuing until about the time I reached middle school
1	I found out tonight that it was the REAL reason I was taken away from my mom at such a young age , all these years I thought it was due to drugs
1	I even learned that my other brother got the blame for it because he was older old enough to be charged and was mentally handicapped and nobody believed my aunt and uncle that it was n't him
1	My aunt said he has always had some kind of obsession with me , always have tons of pictures of me in his wallet but none of anyone else
1	I have always felt uncomfortable around him and still do , I have always had unexplained resentment towards him but never understood why and now I do
1	It all started tonight because he kept looking down my shirt asking about a rash that I have from dry skin
1	I was like why would you be looking there anyways
1	I also now realize why I was so afraid to become sexual with anyone for the longest time
1	While all my other friends were always talking about sex , I had n't even kissed a guy yet because I was scared for whatever reason
1	It sickens me to know that not only has it happened several times , but that no one ever told me
1	idk how to deal with this , am I overreacting with how upset it has made me tonight
1	Bringing up an issue that I was n't even really aware of for the past 10 years
1	I 've been considering counseling for weeks , and this just makes me want to go even more
1	I had a complete hysterectomy last June at the age of 47 due to sever Endometriosis and recurrent cysts on the ovaries
1	Due to the risks of HRT , I chose to take my menopause and get it over with
1	While the hot flashes and night sweats have been annoying , they are something that I can live with until they stop
1	One woman started experiencing this anxiety 3 years after her surgeryI started experiencing these symptoms after a year but have been under and inordinate amount of stress lately with unemployment and family members who are sick and some dying
1	My doctor currently has me on Lexipro to ease the symptoms and I am grateful for it because I could not function otherwise
1	I am hoping that once the stresses in my life lessen , I can wean myself off of this medicine and be fine
1	My main question is has anyone else experienced this and if so , what treatments did you persue
1	I do nt take it consistently thoughI'm terrible about that as I just do nt want to accept I may need to take antidepressantsgotta do things my way
1	Anyway , the dr I see who is really quite outstanding and been a life saver for me mentioned that maybe we should try Abilify as an adjunct to Wellbutrin
1	I had thought it was only for bipolar which I am not
1	I can barely accept and acknowledge I need one
1	I have read some success stories though and may be willing to at least give it a go if my insurance will cover it
1	I 'm sure they are out there
1	Hello I m 22 yrs of age and i live on my own and very distant towards my parents for all the years of physical , mental , and emotional abuse
1	My Father is a alcoholic , drug abuser , woman beater , felon and has been in and out of jail every since before i was born , he not suppose to be living there with them but when I told the police that they did nt do nothing about it , should i say he is a good talker when he thinks he is in trouble
1	My mother is the type that she would do for her men before she do for her kids any day
1	Between me and the 2 oldest we no longer talk with the parents but still try to keep in touch with the younger ones to make sure everything is alright
1	My mother has full custody of the 19 yr old cause of her disability but all she reallly wanted is to get her check
1	The kids get physically , mentally , emotionally abused everyday by the father the mother is never really home cause she stays at her boyfriend house most nights
1	Between me and the 2nd oldest sister , we really want to have them
1	I actually have two extra bedrooms in my house
1	But i do not know about how I would actually go thru with it
1	I do nt want the kids have to go thru what the rest of us experience cause we are very scarred
1	I wish i could go a day without remembering my past and being so ANGRY at them
1	All I want to know is sum opinions on what i should do
1	i just really need some ideas cause i m very torn on what i should really do cause from my experience before i have already went to court about this when i was a kid and the system failed me
1	So please I just need opinions on what you think i should do I would greatly appreciate it
1	I do n't know how much longer I can take this pain
1	I 've had my fair share of ocd obsessive thoughts , low self esteem , and especially anxiety
1	I do n't know what feeling normal is like anymore , because what most people consider normal I consider a blessing to feel
1	Let me cut to the chase when I say that I 've always had some sort of obsessive thoughts
1	However I believe my low self esteem and anxiety started when I began high school
1	I 'm now a senior and if anything it 's like everything is worse , everyone is talking about college and what they 're gon na do and I just sit here completely uninterested
1	Senior year started off so well and so perfectly , I had a girlfriend who I thought was crazy about me , but then I came to realize that was n't the case at all
1	You would n't believe it if I told you , but my friend in late October committed suicide and a couple of days later I found out my girlfriend cheated on me at some Halloween party
1	I 've never felt so low and worthless in my life now that I think about it , but worst part about it is that at the time I felt nothing
1	I could n't cry and I could n't even bear to think about what had happened
1	I had to be strong for my other friends and help them first , because I 'll always put them before me
1	If they 're not okay then neither am I I 'm tired of feeling like this and I 'm tired of feeling worthless and like I 'm not worth anything to anyone
1	I m wondering if anyone has found an antidepressant that works similarly to Prozac
1	I ve been a life long sufferer of depression and been on Prozac for about 20 years now took some vacations off it a few times but had to go back on it
1	In the last year or so though , for some reason , the Prozac now gives me SEVERE heartburn right after I take it
1	And I do nt mean mild heartburn , I m talking a Severe Acid Storm where it makes me nauseaous , i get gas pressure so bad i feel liike I m having a heart attack and it makes me sick the whole day sometimes after these attacks
1	When i got these episodes , I tried everything to get rid of the terrible burning including Maalox , Tums , Rolaids , Gas Ex and even gulping huge thick cups of baking soda with water and even that did nt help it
1	So anyhow , I stopped the Prozac because I just could nt deal with this side effect anymore
1	I have tried Paxil in the past and that did nt work , and I have amitryptilline but it makes me too drowsy the next day
1	Also i have no medical insurance so I m wondering what ones cost the least or are at least remotely affordable
1	I go to the Dr next week and would like to have some information ahead of time so I might know what to ask him for
1	My depression is getting worse since i stopped the prozac quite a while ago now
1	She is 56 , buried in very deep financial problems , physically disabled and absolutely impossible to deal with
1	Her story is nothing new , three decades of divorces , job changes , angry outbursts , promiscuity , bankruptcies and abuse of tranquilizers
1	She has left a long trail of messes because she never took responsibility for any of her actions
1	She is in debt for student loans from 30 years ago , never paid a dime
1	She borrowed so much money from my father who thought he could fix her and he died penniless
1	The first thing she did the morning he died was empty his ATM account
1	She had an accident 7 years ago and suffered brain damage
1	Her mind is the same but she has impaired speech and motor skills
1	I love her but we have never been close
1	She has always been unjustly jealous and angry toward me because I 've had a stable life that I worked very hard for
1	We came from a pretty dysfunctional family so I have a hard time keeping my head above water and I do n't have the fortitude to deal with her it literally kills me inside
1	The whole family has given her money , let her live with us and given our best advice only to be kicked in the teeth
1	My question is 1 Is there any hope for someone to get help in this situation when the family can not afford financially or emotionally to take care of her
1	2 Getting near her is like knowing you have to put you bare hand down a running garbage disposal and yet I feel so guilty that she lives in such pain and I do n't know what I can do
1	I think this disease is so cruel and I am having a very hard time finding any meaning in this situation
1	about a month ago i took something called zyprexa
1	it was given to me but i should ve never taken it

1	My husband takes Zoloft and has had problems reaching orgasm and maintaining an erection during sex practically his whole adult lifehe 's been on some form of SSRI since age 22
1	His doc prescribed Buspar , buspirone as a possible counter to this side effect
1	After about 5 weeks of taking it , my husband 's sexual problems have vanished , in fact , he now has a different problem
1	He 's too sensitive , he orgasms too quickly
1	We ended up backing his dose off a little bit and now we have hit a happy medium and he says his libido and ability to perform is better than when he was a teenager , he 's 38 now
1	he was using Viagra with some success but did n't like the face flushing and overall freaky feeling he would have on it
1	We have n't used Viagra in some time now just thought i 'd share thismaybe Buspar can help someone else out there tooit 's usually prescribed for anxiety though most do n't think it 's too effective for this purpose and it has almost no side effectsat least my husband has experienced none hope this helps someone
1	Monday night , my daughter brought her new 7 week old puppy from her mom 's house to mine
1	I am not a dog person , but I do n't hate dogs
1	This was a 7 week old shih tzu that her mom paid 600 for
1	That night and the following morning we had to keep it in the bathroom
1	I was sad that it was so confined so the next night and day we confined it in the kitchen
1	Thursday my daughter and I were out of work and school due to winter weather
1	Friday I woke up at around 200 am to go to the bathroom and I went to pet the puppy and it did n't move
1	I finally got her mom and told her
1	The sound of her voice suggested it was my fault
1	I took the little puppy and put her in a bag and put her outside
1	My daughter woke up the next day to go to school and I told her that Diamond was dead
1	She was really sad but not taking it hardly as bad as I was and still am
1	She went back to her mom that afternoon
1	Sorry to ramble but I just wanted to give you all an idea of what was going on
1	I have had SAD Seasonal affective disorder for a few years now
1	I hate this time of year
1	Can I get some advice on therapy or home remedies I can use to get me through this
1	My girlfriend is living with me and she has BPD
1	She is driving me absolutely out of my mind
1	I use to just go along with whatever she said , then I started thinking that I needed to stand up for what I wanted
1	So now if I do n't want to watch something or do a certain thing I tell her and I do n't
1	The real reason for my question here is that no matter what tact I use to try to NOT to engage her when I sense a pending argument we ALWAYS end up in a screaming match anyway
1	She 's 27 and I 'm 50
1	I 've tried just not arguing and I get my manhood attacked
1	I 've tried softly talking and I get the I 'm not a client response and it 's on
1	I tried telling her I need her to leave me alone when I know a fight is coming
1	I 've pleaded with her to let me be
1	The second I do n't agree with her or want what she wants she gets real sarcastic and eventually there 's the name calling and attacks on my manhood   why do n't you grow a pair and communicate with me
1	The last 3 fights I 've said I do n't want her around anymore , I ca n't live like this
1	I 'm no saint and I know it
1	I ca n't always tell her the truth cuz she wo n't process it correctly so I lie and I suck at it and get caught
1	Yesterday I begged her to leave me alone , she would n't and I told her to leave
1	She said no I live here and this is my house too
1	The mortgage is in my name not hers and she pays none of the bills cuz she ca n't even take care of the ones she 's got
1	Anyway it escalated real bad and eventually she started packing her stuff about 2 hours later
1	I do n't want her to go , but I do
1	She knows every one of my buttons and goes right to them
1	I am 58 on SS disability and hae been arried fo 22 12 years
1	My husband rages at me , threatens me , yells at me , calls me filthy names and drinks 4 or more mixed drinks a night
1	After he drinks he starts his rages
1	He tells me I have to sit down , shut up and take a sleeping pill
1	Copes called here to help me and they are n't nd have n't been filing any reports on my calls for help
1	He now has a second restraining order on 9909 and nothing stops
1	He left me with 108 3 months behind on house payments , 2 months behind on truck payments , utility bills behind 2 months , auto insurance behind and about to be canceled and last night his sister said he borrowed money ffrom him for his attorney for court and I do n't know what else and she was puttng lein on my truck
1	He now has both vehicles , our boat and he wants the house
1	I am so far down I just ca n't see any daylight
1	Cops just leave him here with me for years now and he just has always kept abusing me
1	Waits til I take my sleeping pill and has sex with me and I do n't know about until the next morning when I am bleeding
1	He just laughs and says he Hopes it was as good for me as it was for him
1	I am trying so hard to stay healthy and win oer the MS but between all he collectors calling and all of his abuse and his family abuseI am sinking so low
1	Now i have no transportation or moneyI feel like I am in a jail cell
1	right now my children are with their dad , and when there with their dad they spend 95 of the time at their grandma 's
1	including one 30 year old looser uncle lives there and has always been oddly obsessed with my son , another uncle and his wifetheir auntie and 3 cousins
1	this week he calls me which is unusual and says something has been going on
1	what was said was apparently a couple months ago her grandma noticed her privates were a little red , so she seen a pediatrician and the dr said she did n't have a uti , to make sure she rinsed really well and no soap was left behind and clean pantieswhen they got home my daughter told her father that her 10 year old make cousin had been touching her down there for quite awhile
1	he asked her brother who is 8 if he knew about this and he said yes
1	since this situation my son has spent all week at his grandmas where the cousin accused lives the 10yr old , a 8yr old and 5yr old
1	my daughter told me she 's not aloud to her go to her grandmas if her cousins are there and her brother told me if she goes there he '' have to beat the cousin up
1	i have n't brought the situation up to my kids in anyway
1	and the mother of the boy my ex sister in law did n't say anything about this to me , and even after asking she has nt gotten back to me
1	on Dec 6th 2016 my house caught on fire and my kids and i woke up to it at 3am , my ex drove 4 hours , went to my children school withdrew them without anyone ever calling t0 notify me , went to red cross to get 250 they give victims who lost everything in a fire , drove back and then called me
1	his only reason was because i did n't have a job to support them and am on calworks and he has to pay a measly 75 to child support
1	i already tried going to the police station where he lives to help in a child exchange and could n't be assisted
1	he 's been in contempt of court for almost 2years by refusing to give me his home address and recently moved to a new address and still refuses
1	while my son is at his grandparent through the school week he does n't allow them to talk to me , and i have no idea why
1	I 'm going to the court house tomorrow to pay for an ex party hearing requesting an law enforcement be forced to assist me getting my kids from him
1	I 'm the custodial parent and he is interfering with my parental rights
1	Hello first of all i do n't really like telling people about my feelings but i really need to know
1	Basically i had a head injury when i was 5 my head sort of cracked but they fixed it
1	Now i 'm 14 and i really need to get rid of them , I hear these little voices telling me what i should and should n't do there names are Bethan , Dean   Kita
1	I 'm scared for my life i 'm really scared because i ca n't stop thinking about death suicide or hurting other people
1	I feel that aliens are controlling me or it 's them who knows
1	I avoid everything dirty if i go near or touch somthing dirty I will scream
1	At night I get these sort of auditorial things like i will hear screaming , running foot steps , gun shots , and voices crying saying ' ' Please do n't hurt me please ''
1	I feel like the news on tv knows how i think   feel
1	Somtimes i wonder why i 'm so aggressive and violent my mood changes every 30 minutes , I 've been to a mental health unit once
1	The psychiatric doctors are looking at Schizophrenia but i think there is nothing wrong with me but i just need to know just incase
1	I 'm 20 years old and a guy
1	Sometimes I 've cried as well , when I 'm not even a person who cries
1	I get the low feeling when I 'm on my own
1	I hate being on my own
1	Things I do n't like 1 I 've recently finished college it was a 2 year Uni course
1	I used to have a big huge laugh everyday with those I used to hang around with   only me and three others
1	I enjoy laughing , and laughing takes your mind off of other things
1	I keep asking them if they want to meet up
1	As I use iMessage I can see if they 've read the message or not
1	They read it but do n't reply to me
1	I have a job which is still parttime at the moment because i 've only recently finished college about 23 weeks ago
1	I like my job , I like everyone who I work with , and customers it 's in a store make me smile a lot , but it 's no replacement
1	2 I do n't feel confident about how I look
1	I think it 's inherited but i 'm quite hairy
1	When I was wearing shorts once my Mum joked , pointed at the telly and it was some monkey and she said you 've got the same legs
1	Yep , I know it mind sound funny , but as i 'm selfconscious about it , it made me feel even more selfconscious
1	I 'm only about 5'8 too and I know girls like tall guys
1	They 're all muscular as well and i 'm weedy
1	Someone told me today that she thought I looked 16
1	I know it 'll be better in the future , but it hits me back a bit
1	I 'm so boring i 've never gone on a night out or drank alcohol but if I did , it 'd be like a group of 20 year olds taken their younger brother out or something
1	If i 'm in a busy area sometimes I feel I ca n't swallow and my breathing goes a bit funny and fast
1	When I get really worried about stuff , I feel light headed too
1	5 My sister hates me for some reason
1	I will admit , I do annoy her sometimes but I only want someone to talk to and try and have a laugh with
1	She just shouts and swears back at me
1	She 's almost 18 and other brothers ' and sisters ' get on well
1	Like my cousins they 're brother and sister and get on really well
1	I found a bump on my left testicle
1	I went and got a scan and it turned out to be varicose veins , but it 's still there and I still worry about it
1	When i 'm cold , it goes and when i 'm hot , it returns
1	Bit like if you 're hot and your veins show up more
1	I also found a bump on my shoulder
1	7 In the space of less than a year , my Great Aunt , Great Nan and Grandad all passed away
1	They were all the nicest people ever possible and I loved them all so much
1	It 's been 23 years since they passed away but I still really miss them and get upset still
1	My Great Aunt was so funny , loving , was always there at Christmas family gatherings , my Great Nan was really loving , generous , kind , and my Grandad was like a Dad
1	My Mum   Dad split up when I was 4
1	He was n't around at all really and only visited about once a month
1	My Grandad was always there , going out with us , making me smile
1	I know you should n't feel like I wish I was him but sometimes I do
1	I 'll be walking around on my own and see couples looking happy , holding hands , hugging and I just wish I was that happy
1	Speaking of hugging , I feel it 's a really nice thing yet it never happens to me either
1	At work , they moved me to a different department which I did n't like
1	After 5 months , I returned to the department I liked working in
1	When I told someone before I returned to the old department , she just smiled , said at last and gave me a hug
1	I know all those 9 things probably sound really selfish because there are people dying in the world , there are wars , people missing , homeless people , but everyone I know seems to be really confident and happy
1	background infos I am bipolar 2 with the majority of my problems being depression rather than hypomania
1	I have been on lithium for 4 months now
1	Except for the fact that I just had a 2 month long depression spike that really fked with my life
1	When I went in to talk with a psych about it I go to a clinic where you rarely see the same person twice , she upped my lithium to 1200
1	I was kind of upset because I knew summer months can affect your lithium levels , and I knew that lithium does n't help with depression , but I gave it a try
1	So yesterday I had a psych appointment
1	I saw the same psych again who 'd upped my dose previously
1	She now thinks my lithium dose is too high and will probably lower it after she gets my labs back
1	I was pushing to get put back on buproprion because it helped my depression a couple years back , but it 's expensive
1	She 's pushing me toward prozac
1	She 's putting me on a weird dose where I take 20 mg Mondays and Thursdays
1	I 'm really freaked out by it but am willing to try because it 's only 4mo and I 'm poor
1	2 years ago I tried celexa and it made me lose touch with reality
1	It 's made me really distrustful of SSRIs for myself , although I recognize that different drugs affect you differently
1	I 'm having a really hard time trusting her because she thought upping my lithium would break the depression spike I was in , even though every other psych has told me lithium ca n't do that , and lithium has n't helped my depression before
1	Basically I 'm kind of freaking out because I do n't know what to expect from prozac
1	I 'm scared I 'll have a breakdown again
1	Ok , so me and my boyfriend were fooling around in his truck
1	He was fingering me and i was giving him a
1	Heres the thing , when he ejaculated , some of the sperm got on my hands
1	I wiped it off right after it happened and kept going in what i was doing
1	We stopped and started driving to Kmart
1	Again i wiped my hands DRY
1	When we got to kmart i went to the bathroom to clean up , another 4 minutes to get to the bathroom
1	When i was in there i went to the restroom and then wiped and such , but then i did something stupid
1	I used my finger to feel around , just barely into my vagina
1	I stopped and went to wash my hands
1	As soon as i started washing my hands i realized my mistake
1	I went straight back into the bathroom and got toilet paper and shoved it into my vagina to try to dry it up in hopes it would catch any semensperm i accidentally put in there
1	Oh and to make this a tougher question , the same day this happened i got my period THAT SAME night
1	My dad and I live together
1	My mother and father were divorced some 15 years ago
1	They recently got back together about a year ago
1	Needless to say my mom moved in with us which I thought was ok at first but now it
1	I knew my mother was a wineo but after they were divorced my mother went to live on her own where her drinking increased
1	15 years later she moved in with us and she shortly lost her job and now relys on my dad and myself to pay the bills
1	My dad more than anything but I help him now
1	After losing her job her drinking really picked up to the point that she has turned to taking shots with her wine
1	She drinks about 2 bottles a night minimum in a span of 45 hours
1	She talks in her sleep for the first 34 hours after she goes to bed regularly
1	My poor dad gets up at 5 am for work
1	They are starting to sleep in seperate rooms and she thinks its ok
1	I guess because her parents always slept in separate rooms
1	I can relate to her and even tried laying it out there that I am an addicts well
1	She knows what I had to deal with
1	Come to think of it she never told me to stop using
1	My hole life my mother has been a super CLOSED person and never talked about anything that was going on
1	I went off today which is what brought me to seek answers else ware
1	I left my house when I was 17 and got an apartment to live on my own
1	I have a 33 year old sister and 28 year old brother
1	I never had much contact with my mom throughout the years we did n't live together even though we only lived 2 miles away
1	One could argue that I never made an effort but the same thing could be argued on her end
1	My dad put her through nursing school while he worked and took care of us kids after he got home from work
1	She took care of us in the mornings until I was about 15 MAX
1	My brother only 10 years old , my sister 14
1	My sister went to live with my dad and my brother with my mom
1	Like everything she thinks if she ignores it it did n't happen
1	When I started driving I really became independent
1	She was a good mother in those 15 years she was around for me
1	When They divorced is when I pretty much lost my mother
1	I never knew my mother as an adult until just a year or so ago
1	We really had little interaction in the years leading up to my dad and her getting back together
1	I always have held resentment towards her but she would never talk about it
1	They divorced because my mom cheated on my dad with his best friend , my godfather
1	The alcohol also played a big role in the relationship as my mom would treat my dad like   when she drank and would just do embarrassing
1	It was n't the main reason but I realized how much of an issue it was when my dad expressed how he hated how she drank
1	She put such a strain on our family and still expects the utmost respect from us
1	It seems as though she thinks just because she gave birth to me that my love and respect should come automatically no matter what she does
1	I have pleaded with her many times while living with me that she not go to bed drunk because she sleepwalks and disturbs me
1	My dad wo nt say anything to her and will stay out of it to avoid an argument
1	meanwhile him not saying anything makes her think she is in the right
1	Anytime I bring up the drinking she gets offended and starts saying   like how can you talk to your mother like that
1	That   is getting old and now just pisses me off if she starts crying
1	I honestly think I am a bit messed up for all of this
1	I 'm sure it has taken a toll on me mentally and emotionally
1	I love my mom but she has become very annoying with this and I do nt have any respect left for her
1	I am sure now that she lost her job because of her drinking
1	She was n't drinking on the job or anything but her drinking in excess the night before just makes her lethargic and just not with it
1	From what I remember she was so much sharper years back
1	she is only in her mid 50s so its not memory loss or anything like that
1	Everything she does anymore is BARE MINIMUM and most times that just is n't good enough
1	I do nt remember her being like this
1	She is a smart person but will act like a complete idiot about things she does n't want to do no matter how bad she portrays herself to get out of something
1	I am ready to leave my own home because of her
1	I have just so much going through my mind right now
1	I still feel like I barely touched on the situation here
1	How do I get her to stop drinking
1	She is not in the best health and do nt think her quality of life will be much to expect if she keeps drinking and eating the way she does
1	I 've been trying to get my anxiety and stress under control by not focusing much on it and settling each in parts , but lately it 's been getting too much , especially when it comes to my mother , who does nothing but stress me out about her problems , her moodiness , and nags over the most small things , college , and finances
1	The thing is , I had depression since I was 13 and I was getting treated for it , but then my parents decided it was time to move back to Brasil because of the crisis in the US , where I lived
1	Ever since I got here , things just seemed to get worse , either because I was aging or because time was moving too fast
1	I 'm almost 18 now , and my mind does n't stop racing with anxiety and stress over college and driving
1	You see , since moving here to Brasil made a bit change I had to make a change in language too , portuguese is n't an easy language at all , atleast not for me
1	Portuguese has made me crawl back into my shell away from society and silly thing is , if I were in the US , I would have no social problems , in fact , i 'd be making friends in a heartbeat , and I would n't be shy or ashamed because overtime I learned ways not to be ashamed or shy about a lot of things but since i 'm in Brasil , it 's different
1	My portuguese is very poor and i 'm scared of setting off on my own here because there 's so much things I do n't know that most of the time I feel insecure
1	College I know will be dificult , especially when doing essays and projects all in portuguese and driving is a bit difficult too , but what I find most stressing about it is going up hills , I fear I might go downhill , though I think this was caused after an incident that happened when my mother was driving uphill and had a crazy panicattack
1	Also , lately my mother is out of work and usually she 's the one who brings the money in , and my father works too but does n't gain all that much
1	I really do want to go to college and get a degree in something , mainly in the biology or social fields , but I still do n't know what another stress i 'm trying to settle
1	I know if I want to get overcome these fears and stress attacks it 'd have to be learning Portuguese and learning how to overcome my fears of driving uphill , and choosing a career but sometimes I just do n't know how to handle this anxiety and stress when it reaches a break point in me , as if it 'll happen tomorrow
1	I just have no idea what to do , sad as it may be , I really have no one in my life , no friends and not even family and I refuse to talk with my mother , because trust me I have tried , and no matter how many times I say , she does n't listen , understand , or even try to help in some way , so I always have to deal with all this on my own my father well let 's just say he 's not too bright in the areas i 'm interested
1	Hi I am a 29yr old female and in 2001 something happened to me whilst holidaying in Turkey
1	I was 15 at the time and my mum and I decided to go on a girls ' only holiday
1	Motherdaughter bonding I presume , looking back
1	So we booked to go for a week to a hotel we went to 5 years before as we both enjoyed our stay and found the staff really friendly
1	A few days into our stay my mum flirted with a male guest   she was quite drunk and she was kissing him
1	She knew he had a girlfriend staying with him but she seemed to overlook this when under the influence
1	The bartender who was 7 years older than me he was 22 , I was 15 came out from behind the bar and kissed me
1	He then put his hand down the front of my skirt and touched me
1	After doing that he took his hand away and took his   out of his shorts
1	He got hold of my hand and put it on top of his , telling me to stroke it and that I would like it
1	Before long my mum , the guy she was flirting with , the bartender and I were all sitting in the outside dining area watching the cable TV
1	At the time I just saw what we were watching as a man and two women hugging and kissing each other
1	The bartender then slipped his hand under me and rubbed the underside of my pants
1	I told him it hurt and he said to me wait , you 'll like it and he inserted his finger up inside
1	He asked me if I had done it and I said no and he then asked me if I would like him to take my virginity away
1	I did n't answer but he kept telling me to come to bed with him
1	When my mum decided it was time we went to bed I kept saying to her that I thought the bartender was really nice and I really liked him that I can not work out , thinking back and she said I think he 's nice , too
1	The next day the bartender saw me in the pool in my bikini and he gestured for me to come over to him
1	He asked me where did you go last night
1	You did not come to bed with me
1	I said no , I had to make sure my mum got back to her room safely
1	He then said , well , I have the key to one of the hotel rooms
1	Meet me there in ten minutes
1	I went over to my mum and said Umm , mum
1	What would you say if   asked me to come to a hotel room to see him
1	Her response was I 'll f'ing deck him one
1	I then went back on what I said as I was afraid of us being thrown out of the hotel since the guy worked there and told her that nothing of the sort was said
1	I see a counselor at the moment about what had happened back in 2001 and as I thought about that I then remembered something intimate that had gone on between my younger female cousin and I and I think it has messed up my sexuality
1	I was 13 and she was 6
1	She was around my grandparents ' house whilst her mum and dad my auntie and uncle were away
1	She asked if we could play doctor
1	I said ok and she wanted to play doctor and have me as the patient
1	She asked me to take my clothes off and lie down on my back on the floor
1	So I had my trousers pulled down and my top pulled up
1	She put her hand on my tummy and moved her hand down towards my   but did not touch it
1	We then heard my grandfather outside and I quickly got up and tried to zip up my trousers before he noticed they were down
1	He looked at me I ca n't remember how he was looking at me as I do n't think I gave him any eye contact due to feeling so uncomfortable and he said to me put your trousers back on , what will your mother say when she sees you like that
1	I felt incredibly guilty and awkward about the whole thing and my cousin gave me this innocent look too
1	I mean , she was only 6 at the time
1	I found out a few months ago that she had come out of the closet and was seeing other girls
1	Which I thought was fine but my grandparents do n't like to mention her very much in our conversations
1	As I got older I noticed that my grandfather was looking at certain parts of me when I lived with them or went to certain places with them
1	When we were in Benidorm in 2005 I was in a changing room and he casually mentioned I had wellformed ts when I was changing into a top I wanted
1	I 've also caught him looking down my topfront of my dressfront of my bath towel
1	And I do n't have a great pair of ts at all , small like an 11 year old 's
1	He 's even found some of my sex toys and asked me how they feelhow they work
1	I felt very uncomfortable when he asked me to show him
1	This is all what I feel has really impacted on my emotionalsexualintimate life and I have n't yet told my counselor about the situation with my cousin or grandfather
1	I do n't feel as though I can now as he wants me to work towards expressing my hidden feelings with the assault in 2001
1	This has put me off internal examscervical screening tests with the doctors which I am not sure if I need to go through with or not as I am not sexually active but have used sex toys and have problems with my cycles and I have been intimate with my boyfriend of 11 years
1	I feel so mixed up with how I feel as I feel so dirty and out of control
1	And that the things my grandfather did looking at me with no bratop on and commenting on it and also the stuff going on with the sex toys makes me feel a bitI do n't knowon edge with him , I guess
1	This feels incredibly weird and strange for me to talk about but I guess what I am trying to say is that I feel safer and more emotionallyphysically closer with another woman
1	I believe that what has gone on has made me distrust men although I completely trust my boyfriend as he knows when no from me means no and will only touch me when I am relaxed and I say so
1	I m currently 17 years old but got pregnant at age 16
1	I m having a little boy in only three short months
1	My boyfriend lives here in Florida but he lives with his friends dad that he has known since he was 2   his parents live in Michigan
1	His friends dad is unaware that I m pregnant and he refuses to tell him because he is afraid of being kicked out and leaving his child and i behind
1	He wants me to move to Michigan and live with his family when i grduate school in November
1	I was unsure as to whether i should pick up and leave all i ve ever known behind here in Florida to go live with the boy i love
1	The problem is , I ve only met his parents twice whrn they came to visit and my family and his family do not get along
1	I ve never been to Michigan and I know absolutely no one there
1	If i go , my parents will never speak to me again and if anything happened between him and i up in Michigan then i would not be able to come back and live with my parents
1	Aside from that , my mom spoke with an attorney and said that if i go up there without a custody agreement and the baby is born there , i will not be able to bring the baby back to Florida without it being considered kidnapping because we will both be minors , we are nt married , and he will be a resident of Michigan
1	I ve heard from my mother and father that his parents claimed they are going to try and get custody of the baby , but i m unsure if that s actually true
1	My boyfriends mother has already taken it upon herself to buy all the baby furniture and everything for up there and pay for an attorney when I get up there
1	My mom and I have already gotten everything here as well though for the baby
1	My boyfriend is now claiming that if I do nt go , he is going to move back anyways because he will never see the baby since my mom does nt allow him over at our house any longer due to the issues she has with his mother
1	Here , i have a job and he rides a bike and i have no license or car
1	I m afraid to get up there and have something happen between us and his family kick me out or take the baby or anything
1	My head and heart are both telling me to do the opposite thing and I m seriously SO confused , Someone please help
1	I m new here and I am hoping that someone can shed some light on what this is
1	I remember when I was younger , like maybe in my early teens that when i was doing something that required focus , if it was quiet and I was alone , I would get a very strange head vibrationif that makes sense
1	It would slowly build up and up and up and spread to my entire body , almost like i was in a dream or disconnected from myself
1	I could n't take this weird feeling anymore and would try to find something to take my mind off it so it would stop
1	Almost always only when there was near silence an I for example was installing a stereo deck in my car , it took focus and it seemed like that was the trigger
1	I do n't get them as often , maybe 1 a year now but as a teenager it was much more frequent
1	I also remember as a small child having to plug my ears when I would try to fall asleep so I would n't hear the low whisper of a voicevoices saying my name repeatedly
1	I am not schizophrenic or bipolar although i do have highs and lows a lot
1	I am not diagnosed but if you looked up the symptoms of borderline personality disorder , it would look like a description of myself to a T except for the sexual abuse aspect
1	I always feel down , always upset and sleep a lot , ca n't get motivation or drive to do anything , I 've lost many jobs because I seem lazy , but i am nit , I am depressed
1	The only time I even remotely feel normal is when my pain meds kick in
1	I know ppl will say that of course you feel better , your highno , I do not get high from my pain meds
1	Its almost like I do n't have enough natural hormones to make me feel normal , when i take the pain meds , i feel like I did before I was depressed , not high , just normalhelp anyone
1	I 've always managed to keep my head and maintain a positive outlook while struggling with turbulent emotions , low selfesteem , and low selfimage that is until Fall 2014
1	I 've been doing research ever since I 've gained composure and the mind to do something about it
1	I have thought of telling someone , but after those little moments I feel better on certain days , I lose my nerve and think , nah , I 'm okay
1	My research shows I may have dysthymia
1	I am reluctant to speak up until I am sure
1	I need help on seeking help , which brings me here
1	I have been married two years
1	We 've been together four years
1	At the beginning of our relationship she was very accepting of my flaws
1	Now she ca n't stand me
1	She attacks me with words , without taking a breath she can accuse me of lying , being a bad husband , being a jerk and a complete failure at life
1	Every time I open my mouth to talk she cuts into her speach again
1	I hardly get a word in , so I get frustrated and angry
1	Most of the time I just shut down and let her talk herself out
1	She just wo n't sit there and listen without opening her mouth
1	Then she sais I 'm nuts
1	Yesterday I was about to pull out of the driveway and she was too
1	From her car she tells me to go get the trash barrels
1	So I shut my engine off and start walking up the driveway
1	While she 's pulling away she smiles and makes a cracking whip noise
1	I bite my lip and keep walking
1	My wife has a way of always finding something for me to do at inopertune times
1	She likes to see me drop everything I 'm doing and do what she wants me to do
1	She feels I suck at domestic life
1	She sais I 'd rather be leading a single life
1	I tell her over and over that I want to be with her
1	In arguements she compares me to her exhusband
1	I know I 'm not good around the house
1	She knew it when she married me
1	It was somewhere between 2 months , and 5 years before , I got schizoprenia
1	I smoked pot with someone who at the time was an enemy and hated me
1	Then when I stopped sleeping I no longer was functional
1	1 Could they have placed something in my mariuana , to give me schizophrenia
1	Or could they have placed something in my marijuana to give me an illness similar to schizophrenia
1	2 If I go to the police about this , what information should I tell them to convince them to investigate this crime
1	I had open heart surgery at the age of 46 I am now 53 yrs old
1	I was in a troubled marriage for 23yrs , cheating , lyingphyscial and emotional abuse
1	I felt like I was dying inside and finally gained the strenth to divorce him at the age of 43
1	When I had the heart surgery at 46yrs of age I always felt it was truly due to my broken heart , marriage and family
1	I met the man I am now with one year before my surgery at the time I was very ill and he insisted on being there for me and he was 100 percent
1	He is a single father of two and I have two of my own
1	My daughters had a hard time with the divorce and always made my partner know that they did'nt want him around
1	While his two wanted and needed a mother so I was fully accepted
1	We have been together 8yrs and have many , many fights over my daughters , physical , verble and emotionalI left him for 2yrs and recently we moved back in together but nothing has changed
1	I feel indepted to him because had he not gotten me to the hospital when he did I would'nt be writing this letter , yet the distance i feel with my adult daughters and my grandchildren make me feel that the relationship is not worth all that I 'm giving up
1	they do n't come to see me I go to them
1	I hate that its summer
1	Both my sisters are away , my mom has a lot of work to do and my dad is always at work
1	I just want to sleep all day
1	I have been drained of all my energy and from that I hate myself
1	I feel like a failure because I know I am a person that is so determined and happy but that person died
1	I have been lead to so much disappointment in my life as a result of incredibly hard work I have put into everything I do and it never pays off
1	It makes me feel like a loser and that nothing can ever happen for me
1	When I think about it I am amazed by how much fate hates me
1	I sound so angsty but its how I feel and I ca n't help but feel stuck
1	I want to be able to move on and be strong but I have no more energy
1	Also my dad is thinking about moving across the country which would be great because it would be to somewhere I would love but I doubt it will happen because anything that would be good for me , wo nt happen
1	Also my parents wo n't let me go on a trip that I am dying to go on because they do n't want to be responsible if something happens
1	On occasion , we will eat out as a family when my 8 year old stepdaughter visits
1	She stays with my husband and me about 24 nights a month
1	I have a 9 year old son
1	My husband and his ex are trying to get their daughter to eat better she is about 20 lbs overweight but they are very inconsistent
1	For example , my husband wo n't allow her to order a soda but she can have a double order of fries or a second entree
1	Meanwhile , my son does not have any food or weight issues so when we go out , I let him order a soda as a treat
1	My husband recently informed me that he was talked to by his ex because their daughter complained to her that when we go out , my son gets a soda and she does not
1	The inference is that I should not allow my son to have one in her presence
1	Is it ok for his ex to dictate what we do on our time I think not
1	My husband thinks we need to compromise
1	I think she needs to mind her own business and not involve herself in what I choose to allow my child to consume
1	She allows her daughter to eat donuts for breakfast so why make a fuss over the occasional soda
1	I want you to know I 'm a teenager
1	But I 'm not like the other teenagers my age
1	I think I have depression
1	They are all Christians , they do n't do drugs , do n't do crimes , do n't smoke , they do n't even cuss
1	i once tried to talk to them about it and they thought I had a demon inside me
1	I ve had these feelings for years , and they only get worse
1	i cry , i sob , over little things , everything hurts me
1	i do n't have friends anymore at school , i can literally go through the whole day without talking to one person
1	and I do n't feel like i have the strenght to have friends or relationships anyway
1	Everything , i 'm just so ugly and stupid and pathetic in my own eyes
1	My grades are slipping to F 's , they are Fs
1	i do n't have goals or aspirations or things i wanna do or things I like
1	I wanna hide and i want to hug all the time
1	My eating is out of control and I just want to sleep
1	I talked to my doctor once , when my parents were n't around , and she agreed I could have depression
1	but I mentioned the talk to my parents and now they think the doctor is crazy
1	I feel crazy , escecailly when I get so worked up over little things
1	My parents love me I know , and they do n't believe in depression for religious regions
1	i need to know , before I really reach a breaking point and something happens
1	Hello I 'm 16 years old and I 'm just wondering if I 'm depressed or not
1	and if I am how I should be going about getting help essencially I guess
1	I 've a hard time these past 3 to 4 years or so with coming to turms with my sexuality which I 'm still not completly sure about because i know i like girls but I 'm not sure about guys still
1	It 's starting to really frustrate and hurt me especially when I see this one girl i 've known since i was 6 and have come to turms with that i really like her and she is so obviously straight
1	My school closed down towards the end of my GCSE year so that was stressfull and my Nan passed away a couple of months ago
1	I 've been getting angry and frustrated easily this past year or so and tearful , but not crying , at the silliest things
1	I feel that I 'm not good enough for anyone even though I talk to people at school and can luagh with them for 10 minutes I 'm not very close with them and can tll that if i was n't around they would n't wonder where i am or probably care
1	One of them always calls me a freak and to get a life because I 'm a bit of a geeknerd or whatever and she wants to be close to all the popular people , the others are just oblivious and seem to forget things i tell them eg
1	i told them how i feel about the girl i like and they always talk about how this really kind popular guy likes her and tormenting me along with some guys in our year about which guy i will ' get with ' they do nt seem to notice how uncomfortable i get around that subject yet i have told them and it angers me
1	another thing i should mention is that i have self harmed before , it calms me when i 'm angry or sad
1	it distracts me when i feel dwon and gives me a buzz when i 've finished
1	though my parents found out and they obviously wanted to know what s wrong so i gave them a little bit of info to please them but i think there hoping for me to open up more
1	they were angry and upset that i had self harmed and said they would get angry if i did it again i do nt think they understand the concept of selfharming much but i havn't done it since then but it does nt mean i stop thinking about it
1	I feel like I 've let them down as a daughter , they deserve so much better than me because they are brilliant
1	I have what people would say a good life , i have a loving family and get to take part in all my hobbies
1	there are people out there in the world who have it way worse than me and yet i 'm here for the past few years but mostly this year struggling with life , i know what i want to do as a career but i always dout ill ever be good enough for a job , course at university , friends , family and that one special person
1	I 'm scared that I 'll always been alone
1	I 've never been kissed or anyone show that they really care for me and it makes me feel empty inside
1	Is it too much to ask for someone to care about you and show it to you at least once a week or so
1	I could go on but I 've already seen I 've written alot and that s an understatment
1	I just wnat to know if their is any point bringing up that i think i may have depression to my parents
1	i 've looked at syptoms lists and seen that i have quite a lot of the symptoms but i do nt know when oor not you realize that you are infact depressed
1	the symptoms below are ones that I 've seen and believe i have
1	  waking up early , having difficulty sleeping , or sleeping more i can sleep over 12 hours and still wanna stay in bed   feeling tired and lacking energy doing less and less i do nt exersise a lot and ca nt find the motivation to   putting on weight i baisically eat loads and do nt feel full and have no motivation to stop   difficulty remembering things   feeling lowspirited for much of the time , every day   being unusually irritable or impatient   finding it hard to concentrate or make decisions   blaming yourself and feeling unnecessarily guilty about things   lacking selfconfidence and selfesteem   being preoccupied with negative thoughts   feeling numb , empty and despairing   feeling helpless   distancing yourself from others not asking for support untill now   taking a bleak , pessimistic view of the future not all of the time but quite often   selfharming by cutting yourself , for example   tearfulness   lack of motivation   difficulty making decisions   feeling anxious or worried   Neglect of personal appearance I 've also done 3 of the online depression assesments and they say i have mild or moderate depression but to not take it as a diognosis which is why I 'm here
1	If some kind person has taken the time to read this can can give me advice or if they are educated enough to see if i am or not them please let me know
1	Thank you so much and sorry for writing so much and taking up your time
1	I have this feeling inside me that I may be living my life full of lies
1	Although , those feelings are there alright , but i am not sure if i have been exaggerating them
1	Right now what has been getting to me is my anger , which i know has something to do with anxiety for sure
1	But anyway , as i sadi the feelings are there but what if i have made everything up
1	I immediately think , when i am having one of those good days , that everything is going to be alright again pffft
1	Then a day or two after it 's back to the normal life , which bothers the hell out of me and i do nt know why
1	I ca n't say i have huge gigantic problems because i know i do n't
1	But i feel like i have been bothering eveyrone and not just on this website , about nothing
1	I do n't know if it has something to do with comparing my problems with everyone elses to allow me to feel a certain way or something like that
1	For example i heard some people say ' You should n't be feelign this way because you see that person over there , She has it 10times worse than you '
1	Well first of all , i expect to much of myself and am struggling with my studies because i want the perfect mark
1	Although i tell others who are the same way , to get over it and that they are being silly , but i ca nt seem to get it completely through my head
1	I am frightened of being a failure , or of being the stupidest person in class , and part of me knows that i am
1	I feel like i ca n't do anything anymore , because most of the things i do are almost rejected by my family
1	Sometimes i think i am ugly and fat
1	I look at others and say , ' why ca n't i be as pretty as her '
1	Why ca n't i be as smart as her
1	I ca n't do anything right , seeing my family are always complaining , especially my grandma who has now got parkinsons disease
1	And my mum has been overweight her whole life , and i just want her to lose the weight
1	She says she has lost a little bit of weight , but she is too busy for anything else
1	I am closed in my little dumpsite most of the daymy room
1	I mean i do come out when my family calls or to eat , but aprt from that i will find any excuse to go back in there
1	He wants nothing to do with me really , and neither do i
1	So i look for comfort from eveyrone else apart from my family
1	So many people have helped me but i have days where it feels like i am takig that advice and putting into action , and others where it just feels like it does n't matter
1	I also see a counsellor , but it is the holidays and she is not around to talk to
1	I ca n't do anything amazing because i am too much of a wimp
1	I just sometimes wish i could die
1	I just wish i could scream or cry and let it all out but it 's stuck in there
1	I sometimes just wish i had someones shoulder to cry on , if i could cry i mean
1	And just hug them until i feel better
1	But that will always be part of my imagaination i guess
1	Well i am not completely sure if this has anything to do with Depression , however i have noticed that my feelings towards my family are not as they should be
1	I do nt know why , It feels as if i may be searching for a new family
1	I do nt really want to be around them much and i do nt ever open up to them
1	They do give me lectures and yell and scream alot and they seem to be bringing lots of my anger and anxiety
1	They do nt mean to , infact things have improved , but i do nt know why i feel worse about them
1	i daydream about others being my family instead , eg my teachers or celebrities on TV
1	I KNOW I AM A HORRIBLE PERSON
1	I feel so bad about it , but i ca nt help feeling this way
1	I do nt want to discuss any of my problems with them because it makes me feel really uncomfortable
1	So i try to avoid them and close myself up in my room
1	I do nt know what is wrong with mewhy am i not happy or comfortable with my family , while they love me to pieces
1	This is the same as the previous post because i DESPERATELY need some adviceand no one answered me  
1	My psychiatrist had initially prescribed risperidone 05 mg offlabel use as anxiolytic and Prozac
1	However , after using this combo for a month , my panic attacks have worsened , and I actually have to use Clonazepam SOS for severe attacks
1	My psychiatrist has now asked me to start on Zyprexa 25 mg and Sertraline 50 mg
1	Although I do not have schizophrenia , why am I constantly being prescribed antipsychotics as offlabel anxiolytics
1	How risky is the use of Clonazepam I use 075 mg thru'out the course of the day , later to be reduced to 05 and then 025 mg as a SOS anxiolytic
1	I ca n't keep on bugging my psychiatrist , and my panic attacks are so bad sometimes that I feel I am being tortured
1	I think I have been starting to be peri menopausal for the last few years
1	For a while I was going forty days in between a period
1	Then in this last year , I noticed a big change
1	I am also on Seroquel for anxiety and sleep , so I 'm not sure if that could be causing it too
1	I have a big stomach , partly because I have given birth to four children and the last one was a ceserean birth
1	For the last three years , my stomach has been big
1	And this about the same length of time that I have been on Seroquel
1	In April and May , my periods started to be less and less
1	I have also been sexually active this year with several different partners
1	In July 22nd , I finally had a period and it was nine weeks in between periods
1	I 'm 43
1	Then I had a kind of heavy one for a few days in the week before August 19th
1	August 19th or a few days before I met my new boyfriend and it has just been us since then
1	I finally am having my first heavy period now from Nov 8 to 11th
1	I had a tinge of in October , but that does n't really seem to count
1	About three weeks ago I got tested for HCG and HIv among some of the basic stuff
1	I also cheated and had a few sips of soda that day , when I was supposed to fast , so cholesterol was up
1	In the last few weeks , I developed a cyst on vagina and my doctor said it was a regular cyst
1	Then she wanted to test me for chlamydia and gonneria
1	Negative for gonneria but positive for chlamydia , so now I am on antibiotics and my boyfriend is going to get tested again and he will get on antibiotics too
1	We will be refraining from sex for 7 days
1	I gave blood in September and it was good and negative for all the other std stuff
1	Okayso I 'm not having much luck finding an answer to my question about the effect of PCOS on perimenopause , and if that could possibly be at the root of a recent illness I 've developed
1	I 'm in my late 40s
1	I guess I 'll crosspost this in the PCOS forum , as well
1	To simplify my question as much as possible , I 'm wondering if I could be starting perimenopause , or if there 's no way to know without monthly hormone tests , since I have PCOS
1	In trying to figure it out on my own , I went back and gathered as much data as I could , concerning my menstrual cycles
1	From the time I was a teenager up until around age 40 , I had 13 periods per year although it would've varied , let 's say 100 days or more between cycles
1	As I indicated , I have PCOS
1	Somewhere around 20052007 , my periods suddenly BECAME regularmeaning , every month
1	I 've read that PCOS can have this effect on perimenopause ie
1	I found my menstrual data going back to Dec 2007
1	Here are the durations between my periods , a year or two or three after they became monthly Starting Dec 04 , 2007   41 days , 2008 34 , 36 , 39 , 33 , 26 , 30 , 32 , 2009 32 , 27 , 32 , 32 , 31 , 37 , 32 , 43 , 30 , 32 , 28 , 26 , 31 , 28 , 30 , 2010 30 , 31 , 31 , 29 , 32 , 31 , 31 , 27 , 32 , 28 , 28 , 21 , 2011 33 , 27 , 33 , 27 , 27 , 28 , 30 , 28 , 29 , 28 , 28 , 29 , 29 , 2012 29 , 28 , 27 , 28 , 27 , 29 , 26 , 28 , 29 , 27 , 25 , 29 , 27 For the most part , they seem to mostly fall into the 2733 day range , at least as of late , with 21 , 41 , and 43 day outliers
1	They are almost always 7 days long , with a few 8 day cycles here or there , and a few 5 or 6 day cycles thrown in for good measure
1	In any event , since Aug 11 , 2012 , I 've been experiencing a slew of uncomfortable sometimes disconcerting symptoms , incl
1	I am not having hot flashes or night sweats , nor do I have vaginal dryness or reduced libido
1	I await the results of my PAP test , a breast ultrasound , a more comprehensive blood test , and a brain scan scheduled for January
1	Sure wish I could figure out what 's wrong with me
1	The vision problems , headaches , and overall weirdness and discomfort make it difficult for me to drive , which is seriously impacting my life
1	My life abruptly changed on Aug 11 , 2012 , and has n't been the same since
1	My husband and my daughter his stepdaughter are in dire need of help
1	They are in such a constant state of turmoil that it seems everyone walks on eggshells at all times in my house
1	She recently told me that now that she 's 13 , she would like to live with her Dad
1	I CANNOT bear to lose her
1	Of course I feel as if I 'm in the middle of something I 'll never win
1	They always end up mad at me anyway and of course each one feels that I 'm taking the other ones side
1	We have a daughter , who 's 6 , and my older daughter sees her step father giving our little girl a lot of love and attention and she feels that she does n't get anything but negative attention from him
1	And , to be quite honest , I think he severely lacks in the loving department when it comes to showing love to my 13 year old
1	We started dating when she was 3 years old and things were great between them until we had our daughter
1	He feels that he 's constantly being disrespected and she feels that he 's always mean
1	I see both of their points , possibly even more of my daughters point
1	But , it 's impossible to talk to him because he 's instantly defensive and gets VERY angry
1	Though he 's not abusive , he does have a very short temper and that is scary
1	I feel like I 'm losing my family
1	OK well let me start off by saying I have 5 kids
1	My and my husband have been together a year and a half been married 3 months
1	His children have had little to no respect for me since the 23 month we had been dating
1	Because of his exs wife 's drug use he now has full custody of his two
1	I have let her get away with slapping , hitting , kicking and punching me up until the last 2xs
1	We 'll the first physical altercation ended in her going to school and lieing to the principal , teacher and nurse
1	Long story short she went into my 3 smaller ones bed room and after telling her to get out NUMEROUS times she cussed me out so I physically picked her up and set her outside of the door where she then punched me in my stomach then comes into the living room and proceeds to throw things at me
1	Lied to her dad and told him it was the other way around
1	As to where I punched her and hit hersettled that dad agrees I MUST OF HIT HER BECAUSE boy13 SEEN IT might I add his face was in his computer the entire time this was happening
1	Any way Sunday it all got physical againshe girl10 was torturing my bio daughter6 so I stepped in
1	Girl10 grabbed biodaughter6 by the hair and SLAMMED her to the ground
1	So I went and got in her face without touching her and told her she better not ever touch biod6 like that again
1	She then started kicking me so I pushed her onto the couch cushions
1	She got up and started throwing hunting boots very heavy and kids shoes at me
1	She now has a black eye and broken blood vessels all around her eye
1	Anyway I jump over the back of the couch and screamed do you not have any since
1	She then picks up a bike helmet and chunks it at my head yup it it me
1	So I chase her to her bedroom and pushed her when she fell into the dog cage and acted like she was dieing
1	Grabs me by the throat choaking me and tell me not to ever put my hands on his child ever again
1	So after apologizeing he says that no matter what he will ALWAYS take his children 's side and what they say
1	I 'm seventeen years old
1	The first day of my period was about five or six days before I lost my virginity it properly finished the day before
1	We had sex twice and used a condom but I think it rolled off a bit when he was pullin out , but anyway we had sex twice
1	I was bleeding at the time because it was my first time , but this was just a little bit and stopped that night
1	Then five or six days later I started bleeding again   I put my hand down and it seemed more pink and slimy than usual , and that night there was lots of brown blood in my knickers
1	Since then and for the next four or so days I 've had brown spotting , I 've been wearing pantyliners and it 's not too much but everytime I go to the toilet and wipe there 's some brown slime
1	I 've been on my period since I was 1213 and I do n't really keep track of it but I 've never had it one week apart and it 's not the same as my period normally is
1	Can anyone explain this to me and help ease my mind   sorry if it 's hard to read this big block of text
1	If you have any questions to ask me if you need more info please send me a message
1	I do n't know if I 'm pregnant or anything , but I really want to know what 's going on
1	After the initial bleeding right after sex I was fine for about five or six days   then I had quite a lot of brown stuff , and now it 's just kind of spotting every day
1	Thank you so much if you can help me
1	Please message me if you need any more info
1	My thirteen year old daughter has recently been complaining of bad headaches , and constant dizziness , fatigue , and lightheadedness
1	She also has very cold hands and feet that she says have recently been very numb
1	Lately , her coordination has been a little off , as she runs into door frames or chairs sometimes she has glasses so it is n't a vision problem and she also seems to drop things , such as a pencil , if she holds it for too long
1	In addition , she almost passed about a week ago , and has experienced that phenomenon a few other times
1	Whenever she stands up , she says she gets very dizzy and feel like she is going to pass out
1	Her symptoms have been going on for about a month now
1	But just a few days ago , she has started talking about pressure on the right side of her head
1	Many of the symptoms seem like brain cancer symptoms , although she does n't get seizures , but she does have moments where she has been unresponsive or had horrible shuddering motions
1	Today on the message of someone here who has posted questions   any one who posts giving help here   there was a remark made by the same person who has done this repeatedly , on the experience and validity of some of us answering questions on the Abuse Forum , I would like for my sake and others to clarify that I personally do have an intimate knowledge of abuse as do the others who try to help , I am sureOne of my daughters was abused she was only 5 year old when it started , I was a working Mom at the time and busy with a life of my own and my eyes were not wide open , the perpetrator was her Gran pa and he lived with a grand ma on her Dads side , and so it seemed fine to allow my daughter to go there a lot , as usual she was told he would go to prison and no one would believe her any way , it was severe abuse
1	To this day my daughter suffers from what she went through my family all have suffered , and I can never forgive myself for going to work and not even seeing what was going onI have also suffered mostly mental abuse in a marriage
1	I write this as my own validation on why I come here each day to help other Folks going through similar , I do not value ' Anna ' making a statement like that
1	I am 19 years old I attend university full time and live an hour   12 away from home in a house with 5 other girls during term time
1	My family life is very good I have a boyfriend of 3 months I have friends both at home and at University I am very lucky
1	So before the Christmas break I had an argument with one of my housemates who I before was very close too as she is on the same Uni course as me
1	It was over something very trivial that I wo nt bore you with
1	It resulted in her telling me to shut up twice in 3 days
1	I was very homesick for the last week of term
1	Over Christmas I went home and focused on my family , I did n't speak to her
1	Term started again a week ago and the atmosphere in the house is frosty , I did n't ignore her but I did n't chat to her like we usually would because I still feel quite offended at the way she treated me
1	On Thursday she confronted me , with another housemate who is basically her tag along , she asked me why I was ignoring her and told me not be act like the victim and to stop trying to get people to feel sorry for me
1	I am not acting like the victim , I havn't even mentioned to anyone that we argued and went about life like usual
1	The only abnormal thing was that I did n't really speak to her
1	This really upset me and I rang my mum over the next couple of days crying because I felt like I could n't even walk into my own kitchen
1	I spend the weekend at my boyfriends house
1	I came back last night and havnt seen her but i still feel so anxious
1	I have decided to work from home for this week so will be going back to my family tomorrow night
1	I am usually in control of my emotions and tend to be very guarded but recently i ve been bursting into tears for no reason
1	I have assignments due in for Uni but i can not cope with even starting them
1	I do n't sleep that well at night and tend to wake earlier than my 7 am alarm
1	I also have Selective Eating Disorder which means I am very fussy to the point that I only eat the basic foods , I have the diet of a child
1	Over Christmas I lost weight I was not trying to
1	When I am upset or anxious I also have a habit of clenching my left hand into a fist and biting the skin at the base of my thumb until it bruises
1	I have a few other issues that play on my mind , my granddad has cancer for the third time , my nan has depression and chronic anxiety , my brother has learning difficulties and is struggling to cope with the pressure of his exams but i ca nt help him because i am at Uni , my friends at home are all growing apart and I am worried that we will all loose touch
1	Sorry for this being so long winded but I felt like I needed to put the feelings in context
1	I am feeling really down and the feelings only seem to leave when i am with my family
1	Do you think I am developing depression or anxiety or is it just temporary
1	Should I seek help from the University guidance team or from the doctors
1	i am a 16 year old girl soph in highschool and i have no friends
1	i ve been feeling very sad and depressed this year
1	i have no friends at school and it seems that everyone hates me there
1	i m shy and quiet but i try and speak to people but they always reject me and when i m quiet they look at me like i m crazy
1	they tease me sometimes but just verbal things
1	at lunch i have a seat in a corner where i eat but sometimes people take my seat and i have no where else to sit so i skip lunch and go to the bathroom or library without eating
1	i have to lie and tell my parents that i have friends at school so they do nt think anything is wrong
1	i ve never talked to a boy and i always wish that a boy would like me and go out with me but they seem to hate me
1	my cousin knows about my situation and she says that i m very pretty and that there is nothing wrong with me but every time i look in the mirror i see ugly
1	i m so jealous of my cousin she has a boyfriend , she s pretty and sexy , so they boys love her and she has so many friends
1	Why ca nt i be happy like her
1	all this makes me want to cut myself again and i have started to but i do nt cut as deep or as much but its something i wish i did nt do
1	i cry myself to sleep every night blaming myself for being lonely and cutting myself but this just makes me want to punish myself by cutting but that s wrong
1	i do nt know what s wrong with me
1	death has crossed my mind but i m too much of a punk to do that so i m not going to kill myself
1	It 's another ' party ' my mother has gathered people and turned them against me
1	I plan to sleep through tomorrow
1	My earliest memory is of my mother reducing me to tears on my birthday because we 'd had a nice makebelieve day and I did n't want it do end
1	She smacked me so hard she bruised me and told me she wished I was dead
1	My earliest memory is of that   threatening to kill me on my birthday , but I have always been told it was my fault
1	The sick thing is , I still love her
1	I hate her so fecking much , but I still love her
1	When I was young I asked her if she loved me
1	She sat me down and told me that she hated me SO MUCH , and as a person she thought I was scum , but because I was her child , she still ' loved me '
1	They never HURT me , which makes me lucky , but I ca n't remember when I did n't cry myself to sleep because their verbal and emotional abuse makes me so sad and so tired
1	My mother used to enjoy smacking me and threatening me , and during my adolescence used to frequently tell people I knew lies about me , and throw all my belongings out of the house in a big black sack
1	She once threw a large metal chair at my head and was sad when it merely hit a counter
1	I enjoyed school , since I was away from them
1	My cousin , my sister and their family , enjoy abusing me too
1	They hurt me so much
1	Hi , I 'm 26 and I have two beautiful girls 2 12 and 7 months old
1	I 've been with their father for 8 years until recently when I finally got the courage to leave him
1	I was totally brainwashed into believing I deserved this awful relationship when literally one day it clicked that I was better then this and told him it was over
1	I was called every bad name in the book , could never do anything right and he threatened to kill me many times
1	I do n't know why I stayed but I feel so much better that I 'm out
1	My concern is my children I have always been the main provider and I only take care of them since birth
1	He never made an effort to try and live with us or be a family hello red rag there but I was too blinded to see
1	We live in the same town literally blocks away so he still comes to see the kids 1 time a day for like 12 hr and I do n't want to keep him away from the kids because I know he does love them
1	My concern is that he like a ticking time bomb
1	He ok with this arrangement now but I know one day he can flip and just to spite me take me to court and maybe try and take the kids
1	This scares me so much because my kids are my everything
1	I do n't want money from him I just want my kids with me becasue honestly it 's in their best interest to be with me
1	The courts scare me and I do n't trust them
1	God forbid he did this could I get sole custody in NJ
1	Let me give you some info He 's been in and out of jail and in 2006 he did 3 years which I waited for him He 's not working on the books He sleeps on his sisters couch He threantened to kill my father and my father filed a police complaint
1	Hi , My daughter has been extremley aggressive for the last 3 years she steals lies and threatens to kill me if she could get away with it she has a one year daughter that my husband and I support and take care except for at night after dinner and bath where my daughter then informs me she is the mother and to stay out of her business which consists of sitting on the couch texting instead of watching her baby she makes up stories about being sick or molested when she was a kid , which is nt true and when i call her out on it she changes her story she will throw fits when she does nt get what she wants and packs the babies stuff and threatens to take her to her friends who is an unfit mother she has bitten me and hits me her favorite name for me is stupid b and everyother swear word she can throw at me she does this in front of the baby who cries and shakes when I tell her to stop she tells me its her child
1	I hate her to come home she makes me sick at my stomach with stress everyone says kick her out
1	I ca nt I have parents with health issues and they love the baby so much that they tell me they will die if I let her go or the baby willl die She knows I do nt want her to move and all I ask is to pay her bills which she never does and gets taken to court over and be respectful
1	I have too much to worry about My Mom has Crest syndrome an autoimmune diesease , my Dad has been having ministrokes my grandma had a massive stroke my son has grand mal sezuires and my brotherinlaw has cancer in his eye Me I survived cancer and when I was going into surgery she posted on her facebook that her and her dad wished I die
1	hey everyone , my gf and i broke up after about a 45 month relationship
1	when we first got together , she did tell me she used to do drugs in the past , such as X , cocaine , and LOTS of weedseveral times a day
1	she quit doing those things 34 years ago
1	however , she told me in the beginning that she rarely takes vicadine , smokes weed about once every 25 weeks , drinks alcohol occasionally , and smokes about 1 or 2 ciggs in a span of 45 days
1	wellwhen i was finished with my 1st year of med school , i was doing research in forensic psychiatry for the summer and moved down to the same city she was in for the summer
1	i noticed that she drank every single dayand i m ' not talking about 1 or 2 beersit would be about 5 or 6 beers , couple of shots , or couple of big glasses of gintonic drinks
1	then , she 'd practically smoke weed just about everydaymaybe every other day
1	she smoked half a pack of ciggs each day
1	and also , she would pop vicadine several times , which i had to find out from her friend , since she swore to me that she would never take vicadine or any narcotics again
1	if we ever had arguments , it would be about the drugs issuebc tn started to worry me how much she was consuming
1	i 'm learning currently in med school how much is too muchand she has definitely surpassed that limit
1	so she would get highly defensive about me asking about that saying things likejust let me beit 's my bodysto ' trying to be my motheri do what i wantstop worryingi have it under control but these arguments immediately resulted in a break up
1	NEVER did we talk about or work out our conflicts
1	she never wanted to open up to me in the past , bc she was ashamed of it and did n't want people to feel bad for herbut one night she really did open up to me
1	she did get sexually abused when she was a child by a crackhead guy , and she said she practically knew how to masterbate since the age of 5 she got physically abused by her step father throughout middle school to high school years
1	she finally moved out , and that 's when she started doing hard drugslike X , cocaine , etc
1	her mother possibly did those drugs while she was pregnant with her as well
1	around the age of 7 , she had massive surgery of her spine bc it was completely misalignedso there was definitely some type of developmental problems
1	she used to be straight up until high school and her first year of college
1	we intensely fell in love , and she would say things likei could see myself with you in your future , you are everything i have ever wanted in someone , etc etc etc
1	but she 'd be like htat one weekthe next week she would be likewe're too differneti do n't want to be with youjust goi'm not going ot follow youjust leave me alonewhat do n't you understandi do n't want to be with you
1	but literally 1 day after that , she would come back to me saying how much she loved me
1	she would say negative thigns like thateverytime we get into the arguments about her drug problem
1	she was so paranoid all the time that i sit there and judge her about her drug problems and just her in general
1	she constantly was likei'll never be good enough for youi'll never make you happyi'm not good in relationshipsi'm not good in anything in life she switched her major about 3 or 4 times , constantly saying she wants to or could have been a doctor , a nurse , a translator , a psychologist , etcbut would never stick to anything
1	she constantly said to me that i just have high expectations of her and she would never make me happy
1	so , one day i sat down and read the entire description of BPD in the DSMIVTR , and seriouslyto my disbelievereading every single line made me think about all the behaviors she does
1	i really honestly think she does have this disorder
1	i also realize everyone has few characteristics of a lot of personality disorders , but she definitely matches 8 out of 9 criterias for BPD down to the T the one that she does n't have is the selfmutiliating behavior like cutting and hurting herself physicallyi believe it 's criteria 5
1	both my parents are psychiatrists and my brother is a psychiatrist as well , and i 'd like to go into psychiatry as well in the future
1	i have done research in forensic psychiatry over the summer
1	however , being gay , and my parents not really accepting of it , i could n't really talk about this with thembc they would just dismiss the entire thing and talk about the issue of homosexuality rather than the real problem of the possibility of BPD and definite substance abuse with this girl
1	so i 'm trying to make an educated guess being a 2nd year medical student as much as possiblebut of course , i am also accepting the fact that i could totally be wrong
1	all i want to know is from some people out theredo these actions sound similar to a BPD person
1	right nowher and i are broken upwhich i need time to healbut eventuallyi want to try to convince her to go get helpbut i have no idea how to bring it up or make her realize or try to find it within herself to get help
1	i know she wants to go to a psychiatrist and get help for her problems bc she has expressed that to me , but has n't been able to do so bc she did n't have health insurance
1	but finally she has gotten insurance from the school for this year , and i want to try to convince her or help her realize within herself to go get help
1	but i just do n't know how to let her realize that she may have BPDwhich i know you really ca n't do to that to certain people
1	if anyone could help me in this situation , i would greatly appreciate it
1	bottom line is , i do love this girl , and i really do care for her
1	it will take me time to heal bc we just broke upbut after a few weeks or whatever , i do want to start talking to her again and trying to make her realize that she has two major problems 1 substance abuse 2 possibly BPD   which i know i really ca n't tell anyone that they have a personality disorder
1	i truly believe that if she can get some type of therapy or help , she could become better
1	she NEEDS help
1	i hope to hear from someone thank you
1	hello , my name is monica , i m 17 but lately i have nt been feeling so well
1	Now i have OCD popping pimples and sometimes i cry for no reason and i frequently keep looking at the mirror
1	idk maybe because my mom always tells me that i m becoming fat and i have to lose weight even tho that i m 164 cm and i weigh 57 kg
1	And she keeps mocking me like the way i dress i like preppy style and urban at the same time but she wants me to be like my older sister 24 years old because she used to be a little bit slimmer than me and had a very girly style like she wears dresses i do nt , she wears skirts i do nt only on christmas or something like that , and she was mature
1	i m not saying that i m not mature , actually i m the wisest one in my family and all of them keep saying that but what i was meaning that she looked like a lady not a teenage girl like i do now
1	That s why i keep telling mom that everyone has a different style and i can not be her and she can not be me
1	But the thing is that i love mom so much and i know that she loves me too , she s perfect in everything but she keeps doing this stuff that annoys me a lot
1	My father always encourages me , he supports me a lot , he s my motivation
1	But my older brother 26 years old is so spoiled , i do nt hate him at all its just that if i did nt clean my room my mom tells me but if he did nt or he cooked something and left everything behind she does nt tell him at all
1	i also have a terrible time trying to concentrate or memorize , but i have good grades , i was accepted to study abroad but i was nt ready so i did nt go , and my other problem is that i have a celebrity obsession miley cyrusi know she s vulgar and everythinh but i love her way too much , and my family is okay with that but i always think of her , idk maybe because i like to be her or have her personnality She s perfect to me
1	idk but i think i have depression
1	if you have been following my story regarding my ex i really need advice nowas i stated i moved 2 hours away from my ex and recently went back to visit and he informed me of jobs out there that are hiring and how he needed a roomte multiple times
1	well i have been searching for a job everywhere and no luck it is getting to the point that i m behind on my bills an really concerned
1	I have looked every where in the town i m living and no luck
1	I actually heard from a friend that the hospital i applied at when i first moved with my ex is hiring and a few other places too
1	I did nt know what else to do so i called and the lady who is doing the hiring she remebered me and is going to call me this week for an interview so i figured while i m down there i will apply for a few other jobs but the catch i would have to be roomates with my ex
1	I talked to him and he was fine with it he even told me of a few places that were hiringi told him that if he ever needed to be alone   hint hint   i would just go over to a friends house
1	like he was trying to say that i would nt need to do that i think
1	I told him i would probally be down soon to apply for jobs and he told me to let him know
1	i told him i would call him the following night to talk about it and he said what s to talk about
1	I thought he might want to talk about since we used to be in a relationshipand when i asked him in the first place he told me how him and a few friends were going for drinks after work and then he is going home early cause he has drill in the morning   as i stated he is in the Army   its wiered that he feels like he has to tell me what he is doing detailed like he wants me to know he is nt with another girl i do nt know
1	i m not sure why he would want his ex as a roomate even tho i appreciate it i m confused what he really wants
1	I 've been married 9 years
1	My husband has left 4 times in the last five years
1	And when it happens my husband will stop talking to me all together and avoid me
1	The first time I got a text from him saying he 'd found someone else and was moving out with a friend
1	He came back in a week and did some counciling with our church pastor
1	He distances himself from me
1	He tells me he wants to separate
1	But because we both own the house he lives in the house but does n't wanna be with me
1	After a few months of this torture we get back together
1	I met him in the big city 4 hrs away
1	At first I agree but after thinking and private counciLing I decided it was not a good move for my daughter and me
1	I tell him
1	He says fine he 's still going
1	He continues to live in the house but we are not together
1	3 months he finally moves out and goes and lives in the city
1	After being separated for 9 months we reconnect again
1	This time we seek professional marriage counciLin
1	I have texts of a conversation with a friend of mine saying how wonderful things were with us
1	We had separate bank accounts to ensure that my credit and money was safe
1	He would pay me a certain amount a month to cover his end of household expenses and the rest was all his
1	He brought up how he was ready to finally change his ways
1	He hates the debt he felt so bad about it and wanted to change
1	He suggested using the equity in the house to pay off his debts
1	I was convinced that things in our relationship were really good
1	Not only were his debts paid but mine were as well
1	Mine was very minimal compared to his
1	He kept me thinking everything was fine
1	He kept saying how he was working extra hours to bank his over time and take me shopping for new clothes
1	He mentioned this to me on a Monday
1	Wednesday he stopped talking to me
1	Friday I asked what was going on
1	He said he did n't think we were best friends aND that he could n't talk to me anymore
1	And he could n't tell me anything because he did n't know how I would react
1	He started saying he did n't want our daughter living in a house with two ppl who did n't wanna b with each other
1	Saturday he said that his supervisor said he could live there if he needed to
1	Since he had a place to stay arranged I knew he was planning on leaving
1	Not wanting to live through living with him when he does n't wanna be together I told him to leave
1	I all I said was leave
1	Our daughter sobbed on the couch as he packed his stuff
1	He never said goodbye to her
1	Never said he loved her or that it was n't her fault and he 'd see her soon
1	He packed his stuff and he was gone
1	He 's left me with the house and all the bills that go with it
1	His share of household expenses was arouND 700 a month
1	He left me with all of it
1	So I 'm left with no vehicle to get to my job that I just got
1	I also suffer from generized anxiety disorder and I was so stresses I could n't function at work anymore
1	They were pissed but they knew what was going on
1	He 's seen his child once
1	We had a separation agreement from the last time we had separated for 9 months but it never got filed in court before we got back together
1	I had to apply for social assistance to cover his half of expenses
1	But the stress and lack of car has Been so overwhelming that I had to resign from my job
1	I loved my job but it no car to get there and absolutely no money to afford a car and gas etc I could t get there
1	There stress has been so much my doctor pUT me on anti anxiety meds and recommended stress leave
1	So now we love off social assistancetill I can heal but also find a job in my small community
1	We have good family 's support with my family
1	I do n't know we 're we would be without them
1	I have so much anger towards him
1	He convinced me everything with us was fine l He took all that money
1	He knew the situation his leaving would put us in and he left
1	Now he lives his care free life and has no responsibilitis because he does n't have to pay all the bills anymore
1	He does n't have to raise his child
1	He just visits for a few hours every few weeks
1	I thought he would go back to the big city 4 hrs away again were his family is and Cuz he hates it here so much but he 's staying here
1	I ca n't go out without planning because of being so scared of running into him
1	I should note he has never PHYSICALLY cheated
1	Starts pouring his heart out to them about his feelings , me and our marriage and he falls for them
1	Then he will always wanna separate but he comes back
1	I guess he finds out they do n't feel for him as he does them
1	I suspect he 's doing this with his supervisor
1	He lives there now with her and her boyfriend
1	He always says I am emotionally unstable
1	He has a terrible temper and was breaking things like lamps before we left
1	Usually when we would separate I would always write him an emotional letter with all my feelings etc
1	I 've never said a thing to him
1	He texted said he wanted to see his child
1	I said sure pick her up Saturday
1	That 's basically all the communication we have had in 4 weeKS
1	I feel like I have lost so much
1	I feel stupid for believing everything was fine and letting him go with all the money I feel stupid for taking him back 2 years ago
1	I have no idea how I will ever be able to trust someone else
1	Even when he was feeling perfectly fine he still laid in bed because he did n't want anything to do with my mom
1	She was always hounding him to get out of bed , but that never worked
1	They argued , he hit my brother   my brother is his childmy half brother and me when we were children
1	My mother hated it when he would hit us but she would never do anything about it but yell at him
1	She would just say   YOU DON'T HIT HIMHER LIKE THAT
1	They might have argued for a while but my stepdad would always stomp off like a coward
1	My mom would leave the house and I would have to stay home and babysit him because he would black out and take seizures
1	Sometimes he would n't even really be sick   he would just fake it so he would n't have to go to the market with her to buy groceries
1	One time I remember of telling my mom I wanted to go with her to the market , that I did n't want to stay home with him
1	She yelled at me and threw a fit and said   If you do n't stay home I 'm NOT going to the store and no one will have anything to eat
1	I was MAD , very MAD , but I had to stay home   I was 15
1	It all started one day when everything was still normal , It was July 5th , 2005 and we had just come home from setting off fireworks when my stepdad collapsed in the kitchen and started convulsing in a lifethreatening seizure and was unresponsive , an ambulance was called and he went to the ER , I was worried because at the time I saw him as a father figure and cared about him because my father left when i was 4 and was the only one that was ever there as a father to me
1	After hours of caring and worrying my mother seemed to not care so much he came out of it and started to become normal again
1	Not long after this they gave him strong medications and sent him home
1	I had been in bed sleeping for a while and he came into my room and started to kiss me and he said   do you know how hard it is being in love with you and your mother at the same time
1	I pushed him off of me and told him to leave me alone
1	  I should have screamed at the top of my lungs but I was still very sleepy and was having a hard time making sense of it all Did I mention my grandmother was sleeping in another bed only 5 feet away from me
1	  He left my room that night
1	The next morning I asked him   Did you mean what you said last night
1	  I wanted to know if he was in his right mind or if it was the drugs the hospital gave him and he replied yes , I did I went to my room and stayed in there for a while and later on in the day my mom had left while I was watching TV in the living room and I asked him how this situation all came about and why he was doing this and he my stepdad began telling me of how he had lucid dreams of performing sexual acts on me , all while he had a smile on his face while telling me
1	I did n't say to much besides asking if he had dreams about anyone else , and he told me he dreamt about my bestfriendat the time , in the same exact manner
1	This went on for a while until he sat beside me and decided to start kissing me , I told him to stop and he did but then he started telling me things such as   This happens all the time , people fall in love   asking    you 're not going to tell your mother are you
1	   i did n't tell my mother for a long time because I knew she would never believe me because I never got a long with him in the first place
1	Within the next few days to weeks   i really ca nt remember he started nagging me to have sex with him , I had no one that I trusted enough to tell or turn to for help
1	He just would n't leave me alone so I allowed him to have sex with me
1	I was a virgin when he did this to me
1	It got to the point that I went to him looking for sex , even when my mom was in the living room I would walk from my room through the living room into my mother   his bedroom to do it even though my mother told me not to
1	At that point in time I pretty much thought and believed that the damage was done and that it did n't matter anymore   not only that but that was the only real attention that I got from the people I lived with
1	My mom was always yelling at me because I did n't help her clean and cook
1	My brother and i we are 9 years apart always argued
1	  My grandma and I did n't get along because i had to share a room with her and she was always wetting her bed and our bedroom i had to share a room with her i did n't have my own privacy stank terribly
1	Present Time My Stepdad is now in jail serving his sentence for Incest   they did n't charge him with anything else because I did n't testify I knew his family would be there and I did n't want them pointing the finger at me calling me a   and giving me dirty looks ,   they already say   He 's in jail because of you
1	because my own mother told them that I had an affair with him and she completely ruined my reputation   she told that to anyone and everyone she felt like telling , Not to mention I was very scared and I did n't even have my own mother on my side
1	She would have stood up for him
1	I now live on my own and i am now 21
1	when i lived with my mom i went to counseling this was only for a month or so because she talked me into quitting she said   All they are doing is trying to get information   my step dad was MIA , did n't go to his court date and was running from the police at the time
1	I have a family of my own now but I often think about these things
1	It is affecting my marriage and my sex life with my husband
1	My questions are   What are your personal thoughts on this story
1	Was I just as guilty as him
1	gained weight 20 kilograms in two years when someone talks to me i feel cranky , like i feel everyone is talking in a bad way to me or i get angry by little things
1	i do n't feel sociable , i do n't fit in anywhere i have problems socializing Because i do n't have anything to say
1	Sometimes i get bad moods and instead of showing anything such as anger , sadness or anything i do n't show , i just shut up and swallow my suffering
1	Sometimes i think about suicide but i know i would nt I m studying graphic design , just finishing it , i m heterosexual , no girlfriend right now i really feel like nobody loves me Nobody shows me love or signs of love
1	I had sexuality issues during the last years I m 19 yo
1	I have lost my last friends
1	I used to have a lot of friends To put an example , when i was 17 i invited over my apartment only my nearest friends and they did n't fit in my apartment , they were around 30 in my 19 birthday , one of my friends that i hang around the most with did nt show up , and there were , members of my family and just two friends i think , in total around 7 members including my family
1	I have several frustrations as i am 19 and i think i will never get married , and never get a car or a house
1	I want a car but i just do n't know how to get it
1	I am not from a rich family , My mom is a surgeon and my dad owns a restaurant but that does nt seem to help as they do n't earn enough money to help me out in that way
1	I do n't see my dad anymore , only when i work with him on weekends
1	I would nt want to seek professional help as i do n't think they would understand neither my family or close friends , they would think i m stupid or something People says i m cute or good looking but my self steem is always low and i always think i m ugly
1	I always cheat on my girlfriends and i end up   up my relationships as i am very unstable , and my last relationship was pure sexual and with a cousin
1	I always think too much about everything , and i think i m very clever and i have several gifts and abilities but i lack confidence and i do n't show them and people thinks i m stupid there are a lot of problems excluding those i mentioned but lets just end by saying i often feel depressed , since i was 14 , and lacking energy and feeling worthless thank you for your replies , they 'll be apreciated
1	I have had severe clinical depression since diagnosed I was 20
1	I am now 31 with two children
1	Of course because I ca n't have just one thing , I also suffer from panic disorder , agoraphobia , paranoia , and self harm
1	I would take off and leave my husband with the kids and go driving in the middle of the night to lay in a field for hours
1	Breaking everything in my path , hurting whomever is in my path with the words that I know will hurt them the worst
1	My family is scared offor me
1	I just need to see other people like me to know that I 'm not alone
1	Hello everyone , For the past 10 years or so I have been living with pretty severe anxiety that has only gotten worse
1	When I started my new job , which is extremly stressful I noticed alot of my emotions both good and bad are numbed out
1	I have tried several meds for my anxiety including buspar , klonopin , and xanax
1	Klonopin and xanax both work , but do nothing for my mood really which I was hoping was mostly anxiety related
1	I do n't the typical sadness or feeling down like you do with depression , but rather the apathetic and low energy depression , but also really bad anxiety
1	I have tried Wellbutrin and Lexparo about 10 years ago
1	Wellbutrin worked great for my depression , but also increased the anxiety
1	Lexapro seemed to do nothing for my mood other than completely numbing my emotions and killing my sex drive
1	I have avoided going back on meds , but I really feel like it 's time to do something
1	I know benzos are supposed to be long term , but am wondering if something like Wellbutrin and Klonopin may be my best bet
1	I was looking into Remeron , but am concerned with the weight gain
1	The main side effects I am looking to avoid is low libido , emotional numbing as I already have that , and weight gain
1	I am a 35 year old male with Anxiety and Depression
1	I was diagnosed a year and a half ago but have probably had this condition most of my adult life
1	I started having panic attacks in the winter of 2008
1	I went to the emergency room several times before I was diagnosed with a panic disorder
1	I was prescribed Valium for a short period of time but it did nt really work for me
1	So in the spring of 2008 I decided to make changes in my life
1	I began therapy , lost wieght , worked out everyday , changed my diet , deep breathing and dedicated myself to getting better medication free
1	The best advice I can give to anyone with Anxiety is to pick up a copy of The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook by Edmound Bourne
1	It changed my life and helped me more then any drug so far
1	By the summer of 2008 I felt much better but did nt fell great
1	So in August of 2008 I started Lexapro
1	I went on Lexapro for four months
1	I could nt understand it cause I always had a full thick head of hair
1	I did some research and found out this is a common side effect of this drug and my doctor never warned me about it
1	I went off the drug in December 2008
1	Last month the stress and anxiety in my life got so bad I had the worst panic attack in my history
1	This attack was way more intense and severe then anything I had previously experienced , so I went to the emergency room with classic cardiac arrest symptoms
1	I was kept there for two days and eventually checked out fine
1	I am tired all the time , my muscles are sore , have no energy , no motivation , have gained wieght and have nt had a good nights sleep in years
1	My Psych doctor wants to put me on Pristiq
1	Yes , the same doctor who never mentioned the side effects of Lexapro to me
1	So , I am naturally worried and have done a ton of research on Web Md and other sites
1	It seems that this medication either works great for you from day one or it is a complete nightmare with side effects worse then your initial Anxiety
1	Can you describe how you feel
1	9 Did you experience high Blood Pressure or High Heart Rate
1	10 Did you feel different the first day you took this medication
1	As you can probably tell I am very anxious about starting any new medications
1	Thank you all for your opinions , feedback , understanding and patience
1	I have had a very good friend so I thought she was for many years we are now in our mid 30 's we are both married and have children
1	Our husbands in time became like best friends so we did lot 's of visiting and went out as couples all the time at times it was every single week end
1	Just a few weeks at one of these visits the couple was at our home we all had drinks and were a little dizzy but not much my friend and her children stayed at my house she slept at the couch in our living room her children on the floor
1	I went to my room thinking the kids and my friend will be okay after a few minutes i realized my husband was not in the room yet so I walked out to see if maybe he had fallen asleep in the kids room or just to see where he was , as I walked into the living it was a little lite I noticed he got from being on top of her , all I said was I saw that I froze I did not know what else to do or say I stormed back to my bedroom sat on the bed and waited for him to come in like 10 minutes passed by and nothing so I went back out and he was on top of her again kissing her
1	We have talked he wants a 2nd chance
1	I am having a very hard time I do n't know what to do I picture the scene all the time I ca n't even walk into my living room
1	The one that was my friend chose to say she does n't remember a thing and if I do n't want to talk to her anymore she understood
1	We have 3 little boy 's I thought I had the perfect husband and the perfect marriage and now I want out but then I do n't what should I do
1	I ve been doing a lot of thinking lately about my relationship or lack there of with my dad
1	I ve always tried to earn his love and attention but i feel like i ve never gotten it
1	As a teenager i coped with anorexia , depression and extreme social anxiety which was only fueled more when i d visit my dad and he d call me lazy because i did nt want to go outside and play
1	I m going to be 27 this coming month and to this day he ca nt remember the year i was born
1	I feel like a horrible person because i resent him for not being there for me but i also blame myself because i was apparently never deserving of his love
1	I have a half brother who is 10 years younger than me and has always gotten all of my dads love and attention , i m so extremely jealous of that and because of the jealousy i m not close with him at all
1	I ve been considering writing my dad a letter and pretty much telling him how i feel and cutting ties with him , although i know if i do that ill be the horrible person
1	All i ve ever wanted is to be daddys little girl and i have never had that
1	My mom who has always been there for me thinks i should n't worry about it at all and just let it be , but i feel so unwanted and i just want to know why he never wanted to be around me and why i could never make him proud
1	I just need to know if writing him a letter to get closure is a good idea
1	I know of course that it depends on the individual but I wonder if someone could give me an overview of what Borderline Personality Disorder is
1	I 've always suspected my mother had some kind of mental health issue but she has never acknowledged there 's a problem so will never get a diagnosis
1	I do n't ' need ' her to be diagnosed but certainly feel like some information would be helpful in acceptingunderstanding some of her behaviour over the years
1	I am due to begin work with a therapist soon who at our initial meeting suggested my mother suffers with some kind of mental illness which was helpful as although my gut has suspected as much my whole life I have blamed myself for everything just as she had always done blamef me
1	As far as possible I need though to get the ' right ' diagnosismy sister has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I wonder if my mother falls into this bracket
1	9yrs ago I was in a violent relationship for 3 12 yrs
1	I was 15 when I met him , he told me he was 18 , but then told me wks down the line he was infact 21
1	But then he became paranoid , possesive and accused me of cheating with anyone and everyone
1	He slapped me once and tryed to hit me with a stick
1	Then I had fallen pregnant at the age of 16 , young I know , but my son is my world
1	Dragging me by my hair , punching me in ribs , slapping me , he put a knife upto my throat , he even went for me with baby in arms
1	I had to quit job as he locked me in flat
1	And I think he was dealing from the flat , as I found a huge bag of cannabis hidden in the cupboard
1	People dragging him from the flat beating him up infront of me , and him getting attacked outside while I was with him
1	He even took money from his son that had been given to us to by baby clothes ect to buy cannabis
1	The day I finally left , we had an arguement before hand , I wanted to visit family but he said we did nt have any money because him smoking cannabis
1	Anyway I accepted that he said no , but he just could nt resist hitting me again , because I had answered back
1	He pushed me on floor hit me on head with his hand , kicked me in tummy , he then picked up a pram toy the one 's where you clip it to the front of the pram It was solid
1	And he was going to hit me over the head , I screamed and begged him not to
1	He told me he would scar me before I got the chance to leave him
1	I ran out back garden fell on my hands and knees crying , he apologised BLAH BLAH BLAH
1	After things calmed down I said to him I wanted to go phone my mum at phone box to let her know I could nt come to visit her
1	I took my son with me , I rung mum , told her he hit me again and I wanted to leave him
1	She told me to go somewhere safe , i quickly ran to bus stop as a bus was coming , but I looked back and he was running after me
1	Went friends and my big bro picked me up , and then next day , my mum payed £ 300 to get me to her in a taxi
1	He had my number and kept ringing me , a few times I answered and he said he was going to kill us both when he found me
1	I then changed number and have not heard from him by phone or letter since
1	In 2006 he applied for a contact order , he represented his self but then never turned up in court , so it was dismissed
1	I obviously told solicitor my worries
1	Anyway , on the 21st of dec 2010 I had letter from court , he is trying for a contact order again
1	I only told my mum just 3wks ago
1	When I was with my ex , it was a month and a bit before I left him , he forced me to have sex with him
1	I said no to him , I cryed a little , but then just let him , there was nt a struggle
1	He pulled my hair a little , and said to me he needed sex
1	I let him because I was scared of him hitting me again , was it rape
1	My mum said it was , but I 'm confused because there was no struggle and did nt think it would be classed as rape
1	My mum has told me maby I should report , but it is my decision I am really scared now , because of him taking me to court
1	Do I open up and tell someone else what happened , I am scared they will not believe me as I did not report it sooner
1	I am confused , but I really do nt want someone like that near my son
1	He also knows what city I am in
1	He does not know my address , well I hope not
1	I have to move as I do nt feel safe , he may be at court and I really do nt want to come face to face with him
1	I am worried he may follow me back home after
1	There are so many medical communities that I can relate to and want to post but they seem so out dated and no one is participatingI'm taking my chances here to see if anyone responds
1	Me and my ex were together 9 yrs , we moved in together after 6 months , dated 7 years and were married the last 2 years
1	He said it was his brother using the rooms
1	I guess I felt trapped since we bought a house before we were married but in retaliation one night in the woods just over 3 yrs ago I kissed another guy
1	6 months later I slept with the other guyand we kind of carried on a relationship for 3 yrs even though I was married and still kind of with my ex
1	To wrap this up , last year me and the other guy started to get carried away and not use anything and I 'm now 9 months pregnant with his baby
1	I found out in oct , moved out in dec and finalized my divorce in april
1	My now bf moved in to my place in March and things are so different
1	We fight all the time , and neither of us are the same person we were when it was kind of a fling
1	I think I 'm missing my ex but he was n't any better , idk what to do
1	My fiance and I broke up about a month ago
1	We still talk we still actually had hope for the future
1	Our relationship has always been really rocky and we knew we had problems
1	He moved out and has been doing his own thing , trying to do me as he puts it
1	He hangs out with girls and flirts and everything , but has said he has n't been with anyone
1	I 've avoided situations like that because I did n't want to do that or be there
1	At the end of the night I invited several people guys and girls back to my house for an after party
1	We drank until 7 am
1	I do n't know why I went into my room with him
1	I did n't really want to do anything , I just liked the attention
1	Next thing I know my pants are off and he 's on top of me
1	I told him over and over to stop that I did n't want to do this
1	I continued to tell him to stop
1	I was even in tears , crying and begging him to stop , I open my eyes and he is staring at my face and in my eyes telling me , it 's ok baby girl , you 're ok It most definitely was n't ok For almost an hour he raped me , I even fell on the floor , where he made me understand that he was almost done , like it was going to be over soon
1	I know that I put myself in that horrible situation
1	But it did n't give him the right to violate me
1	I was so sick , he did n't leave my place for hours , like he was trying to make sure I was n't going to report it , but continued to try and justify his actions
1	I did go to the ER for a rape kit , I do n't know if I have the strength to press chargesbut right now
1	All I ca n't think about is if I betrayed my ex fiance
1	Should I tell him what I went through
1	I 'm afraid he is going to think that I put myself in that situation and that I 'm damaged and he will never look at me the same , that he is just going to run
1	I do n't want people to look at me differently
1	Hi All Its been 5 months i have been seperated from my husband and we are now in the process of Divorce
1	This all happened due to his obsessive family and they have brainwashed him to believe me and my family are bad
1	I loved him sooooo much and we were best friends for 12 years , we only hung out together so our social life with friends was fairly minimum
1	They did nt warm to me and as with any new environment it takes time to adjust when his siblings were wrong no one stood up for me not even my husband
1	It got to the point his mother told me to go back to my mum 's
1	Incidents were created petty things and i was then dropped to my parents home twice
1	2nd time round , which is the most recent i decided that enough was enough and they could nt keep dropping me
1	Over the last 4 mths he has insulted me and my family to no end and refused to meet me only if i apologised on something his family had fabricated and plotted
1	I refused to say sorry and base my marriage on a lie
1	He was the most charming and caring guy behind closed doors , but in front of his family he was in full support of them and would put me down and he said he was wtaching me and testing me how i would be around his family
1	I still love him my mind says he is no good but my heart is missing him
1	He wo nt respond to any emails or messages and is making our friends cut off from me
1	Do you think i am doing the right thing , or should i just go back
1	I am 46 years old and am very cycle regular with 29 day cycles
1	I had an unplanned pregnancy at age 44 that ended in miscarriage at 13 weeks in spite of a normal cvs genetics test
1	My last period started on May 25 and lasted for my average 4 days
1	On day 16 I began having a light brown discharge that lasted 4 days
1	My real period was due this past Wednesday , June 22 and has not come
1	I immediately took a urine pregnancy test negative on Wednesday afternoon and again on Friday morning
1	The pregnancy that I had at age 44 did not show a positive urine test when I tested 6 days after my period was late so I am both excited and nervous that I could be pregnant again
1	I will obviously see my doctor next week if I ca n't figure out what s going on
1	I will be very happy if I am pregnant and this time I will transfer to a high risk doctor as my sister wanted me to do last time she 's a nurse
1	Keep me in your prayers please
1	I 'd like to talk more about my Effexor withdrawal
1	It 's been over a month and the physical withdrawal is gone , however the feeling that I thought I had for just a few days is gone as well
1	I feel worse than I did before I went on Effexor almost 5 years ago
1	I have been reading and searching for anything that will make how I 'm feeling mentally go away
1	I am miserable , I feel so much anxiety ALL DAY from the time I wake up
1	Actually yesterday when I was trying to explain to my husband how messed up I feel I told him waking up is the worse part of my day
1	I do n't eat , I ca n't think , I 'm angered easily , I ca n't concentrate , I 'm having nightmares , I cry all the time , I do n't want to be bothered by people , and ca n't help but think negatively all day
1	My talk therapist told me that the point of withdrawal I 'm at is the mental portion and unlike the physical portion which seemed like a breeze compared to this hell lasts a lot longer
1	I do n't really know how much more of the Effexor Nightmare I can take
1	Everyone tells me you 'll get through this think positive but when you ca n't how can you
1	Had I known that going though withdrawal would be like this I would have NEVER gone on Effexor
1	I think you truly ca n't understand what this nightmare is unless you 've gone through Effexor Withdrawal
1	I wonder even if I have any serotonin in my body
1	Worse part is you can get blood work for levels of serotonin in your blood , but in order to get the proper level reading of where the level is in your brain is when your dead
1	I see both my Dr and Talk Therapist tomorrow
1	My Dr will probably try to remedicate me with something else and my talk therapist will keep telling me to out think my brain and say all the words of comfort I 'll need to hear at that point in time
1	But I do n't know how I can fix this
1	When this is over who will I be and will I be normal again
1	I always said from day one when I decided I did n't want to be on Effexor and tapered down , what if I do n't like who I am
1	I still worry about that because I HATE who I am now
1	I am 48 years old
1	For the 2 years prior to the last , I have had normal periods mixed in with a month here and there of skipping a complete month , then back to normal
1	I have since moved to another state and of course new obgynand for the past year however I had a period that lasted 3 weeksheavynormal with clotting for a week , slowed down for a few days , then started back up again like a regular period4 days later slowed and then just spotted for the next weekred then brown , then done
1	It scared me a bit , so I went to new obgyn , he said pretty sure you are in premenopausehe did an exam and felt a fibroid
1	I had never been told that , called my old doctor , and they said that none were noted
1	Papsmear came back normal as did the biopsy of the cervix he took
1	He said just to keep an eye on the bleeding and probably just my body going through premenopause
1	I asked him about cancersince I am a worrywart
1	Then , I went 6 weeks , no period , then my period came for almost a month this time
1	I called him again and he said , lets do another vag and topical ultrasound the first ultrasounds were exactly 6 months ago
1	He said he would do an FSH test and if it 's 20 or below that he would try me on a low dose BCP
1	Wellmy number came in at 80 , well into menopause , so he said that he has never put a menopausal women on BCP
1	He said that if the bleeding is bothersome and I want quality of life to have a hysterectomy
1	I then again asked , if it 's not bad should I just go through the periods as long as I am not anemic
1	Before he said nonow there 's a chance Can you help
1	I am a 38yearold woman and have suffered from severe depression for the past two years
1	Last year , I started thinking a lot about my relationship with my paternal grandfather
1	He died about 5 years ago
1	I know that this will sound very cruel and heartless but I was not very saddended by his death
1	It hurt to watch my grandmother , mother and daughter who were all close to him suffer but I knew that I was not going to miss him at all
1	My grandparents divorced before I was born but according to my mom , I was around him off and on bt the ages of 2 and 12
1	I do not remember spending time with him during that time except for once and all I really recall from that is riding alone in a car with him and him telling me jokes
1	When I was 12 , he and my grandmother reconciled and remarried and both quit drinking
1	I was not happy about their remarriage but probably bc I had been able to spend so much time alone with my grandmother and knew that our alone times were over
1	However , ever since I can remember , I always felt extremely uncomfortable around my grandfather
1	He was a very emotional person suffered through childhood abuse , grew up in an orphanage and he needed to be reassured of our love for him
1	Ever since I could remember , I never felt comfortable hugging or kissing him
1	In fact , the thought of doing it or actually being forced to do it made me physically sick to my stomach
1	I have never been a very touchy person and it is difficult for me to show affection to my family except for my daughter and even then that can sometimes be difficult
1	I remember my grandmother talking to me about how much it hurt my grandfather 's feelings that I could n't simply give him a hug and kiss goodbye
1	I could n't explain to her or anyone else why it bothered me and did n't want to hurt his feelings so I started telling people I was n't comfortable hugging or kissing anyone
1	Last year , I started really thinking about this and wondered if there was a possibility that he could have sexually abused me at some point
1	I am not sure that I believe in repressed memories and I know how controversial they are
1	I approached the subject with my mother and she said that when she was 16 , my grandfather her father had been drinking and kissed her goodnight but it was an inappropriate fatherdaughter kiss
1	She also said that she had concerns that he had done something to me bc I acted strangely very clinging after a visit I had alone with him
1	She said that she and my dad did n't want to plant any ideas in my head and since I never said anything about it , they decided to let it go
1	I wish I could either just let this go or remember something so that I can deal with it and move on
1	Am I just creating memories to help me cope with feeling guilty for not likeing my grandfather
1	This all started on March 12th when I noticed my neck felt funny so I rubbed the back of my head right over top of the neck where it meats the head
1	I notice I had a knot there
1	So I really paid it no mind until a few days later it did n't go away so I started to get a lil worried and started checking my neck and head for knots about a 34 days later I notice a knot in my neck so I mad a doctor 's appointment
1	The doctor told me she thinks it 's a knotted muscle and just give if a few weeks , she went on to ask questions if I been bitten or pulled a muscle I told her I do n't think so so I let a week go by and the knot stil did n't go away   so I started to research on the internet to see what it might be everything kept coming up as cancer so I went back and told her I 'm scared it 's cancer
1	She still did n't seem to concerned , she asked me did I stress a lot and ever had anxiety I told her yes but I do n't believe this is all caused by anxiety so she ordered a ultra sound for me before my ultrasound appointment my face started to go numb on left side my ears started to feel plugged and like they need to pop so I got the ultrasound and they said they saw to little lymph nodes on each sides and that s it 's normal my glandes on each side was different I think one side was like 2 cm and other was 4 cm but they said your body is different on each side
1	I think I have some sort of problem , but I do n't know what
1	I am a 15 year old girl from the UK
1	Towards the end of year nine at school I started acting differently
1	I did this because I wanted them to annoy me , to anger me
1	The I would shout at the person who had annoyed me
1	I would sit , making plans for the next day , at night
1	Then I started wanting to annoy some of my teachers so I would be worse in there class
1	When the teacher came over to me I would stay silent
1	I had a thing about putting my hand up to my face to hide myself , I called this my safety position
1	I would be very sly when annoying the person in the first place , so that the teacher would n't notice until I started shouting
1	I think myself as a nice person when I am not acting in this way , but I need to know why I am acting in this way
1	Hi , i had a 9 day break from my last period and started bleeding again to my great surprise
1	My period is not to begin till 7 days later
1	i 'd wear my pad everyday , thinking it 'll be soaked as per my normal periods , but it did n't
1	however , whenever i wipe it after urinating , there will be enough amount of fresh blood , which is a lot , to make me worry
1	i know it is not from the urinary tract cos i made sure i wiped it separately just to test
1	It has since been 10 days i 've had this bleeding problem
1	the blood is fresh , a lot , sometimes lightly clotty , mostly fresh blood as though you fell on your knees with dripping wound
1	i 've never had intercourse so i do n't really know what the issue is right here
1	i 'm not on any pills , neither have i swallowed any paracetamol i have problems swallowing pills anyway which could have aggravated the bleeding
1	before i actually spin some horrific disease in my head
