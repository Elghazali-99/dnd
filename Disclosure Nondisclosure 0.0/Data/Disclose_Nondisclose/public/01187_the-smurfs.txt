The Smurfs

The Smurfs are fictional little blue beings who live in a forest created by Peyo, a Belgian cartoonist. They first appeared in 1958, and later in a cartoon television show created by Hanna-Barbera Productions in the 1980s. They also appeared in comics. On September 12 1981, they were featured on NBC on Saturday mornings as a cartoon series. The little blue creatures from Belgium became popular among all ages.

A feature movie called "The Smurfs" was released in 2011. "The Smurfs 2" was a sequel released July 31, 2013. 

Most Smurfs are male. There are only 3 females in the village: Smurfette, Sassette Smurfling, and Nanny Smurf. 

Most Smurfs wear white pants and Phrygian caps. Papa Smurf, Grandpa Smurf, and some of the Smurflings dress differently. Grandpa Smurf wears yellow clothes and Papa Smurf wears red clothes. The Smurflings are Sassette, Snappy, Slouchy, and Nat. Sassette and Nat do not dress like the other Smurfs at all, while Slouchy and Nat do dress like the othets. In some comics, the Smurfs dress differently in color or clothing.

Smurfs live in mushroom-shaped houses.
