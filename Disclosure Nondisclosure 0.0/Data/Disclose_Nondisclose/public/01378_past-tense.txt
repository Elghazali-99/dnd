Past tense

Past tense is a verb form which is marked by time (tense). 

The past tense is used for actions in a time which has already happened. In order to explain and understand past tense, it is useful to imagine time as a line on which the past, the present tense and the future tense are positioned.

Words in English have several tenses, including many common past tenses. The two that are used the most are the simple past tense and the perfect tense

The simple past tense is used when telling a story. Different verbs change in different ways to make the past tense. The most common way is by ending with ed:

Many other verbs are "irregular", this means that there is no pattern and no easy way to know how the verb changes. Some of the most common irregular verbs are:

One very irregular verb is "to read", which is the same when written down in the past tense, but pronounced differently. In the present tense, "read" is pronounced like the word "reed" or "seed", but in the past tense it is pronounced the same as "red". In the example below the spelling of the verb does not change, though the tense (and thus the pronunciation) does.

The Perfect is about "completion": actions which are completed. The tense refers to a period in the past. In English the Perfect is made by have + -ed or variations of that form.

Verb endings: -ed = finished; -ing = continuing
