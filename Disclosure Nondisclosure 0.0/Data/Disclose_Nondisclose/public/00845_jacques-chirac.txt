On 14 July 2002, during Bastille Day celebrations, a man tried to shoot Chirac. There was a lone gunman with a rifle hidden in a guitar case. The would-be assassin fired a shot toward the presidential motorcade. He was then overpowered by bystanders. The gunman, Maxime Brunerie, had psychiatric testing.
