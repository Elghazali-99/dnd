Crayola

Crayola is brand of crayons and other writing and drawing utensils, such as markers, chalk and colored pencils made by the Binney & Smith Inc. company, which is part of the card company Hallmark.
Binney and Smith made industrial products before 1900, but in 1903 started to make Crayola crayons. The name came from a word used by the wife of Mr. Binney. The first box had eight colors: blue, green, red, yellow, black, brown, orange and violet. They became well-known because they were the best crayons at that time. Later, the company made more products, including boxes of 48, 64, 96,120 and 202 Crayons, colored pencils and markers.

In 2003, the company built a huge blue crayon that was 15 feet tall and weighed almost a ton.

Here are the 133 standard Crayola crayon colors. According to its chronology page, Crayola considers each "core color" to have been introduced in a specific year. These dates are reflected in the table below. The hex triplets below are representative of the colors produced by the named crayons.

F= Fluorescent
P= Pastel

The following is a list of colors included in the 12, 24, 36, 50 and 64 packs of Crayola's standard colored pencils. Color values are approximate. Colored Pencils from "Guppie Green" to "UFO Green" are 14 of the ultra-cool and super-hot colored pencils that will be issued on July 2010.

In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the 64-box of Crayola crayons in 2010, a 64-box of Crayola colored pencils was issued. It had the same colors as the current 64 box.

All 44 colors are on this list.
