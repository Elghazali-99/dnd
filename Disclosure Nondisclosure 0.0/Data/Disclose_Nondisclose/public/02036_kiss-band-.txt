They are most famous for their stage show and songs like "Rock and Roll All Nite" (1975), "Strutter" (1974) and "Detroit Rock City" (1976).



KISS has had several changes in style and lineup. Their more famous era was in the mid 1970s, particularly the first 6 studio albums, and the first live album, Alive! which was widely popular. In the 1980s, KISS started to follow the trend taking place with more synthesizers, and songs that many fans didn't like because of a big change in style. In the 1990s, KISS changed toward the grunge and heavier trend with Revenge and . The original members reunited for Psycho Circus and then parted ways again in 2002. Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer replaced Frehley and Criss, and the current lineup has made the 2009 album Sonic Boom, which was a return to the classic style of the 70's, and many fans liked it. The follow up to that is going to be released in June 2012, titled Monster.
