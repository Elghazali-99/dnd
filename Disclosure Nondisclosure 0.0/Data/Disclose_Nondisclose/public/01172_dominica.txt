Dominica

The Commonwealth of Dominica is an island nation in the Caribbean Sea. It is an English-speaking country. It is located between the French-speaking territories of Guadeloupe and Martinique. The island measures 751 km² (290 mi²) in area. Roseau is its capital. Portsmouth is another main town. Almost 70,000 people live on the island.

The currency of the island is the East Caribbean dollar.

The island's name comes from the Latin for Sunday, "Dies Dominica". It is not to be confused with the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic in the Greater Antilles.

The country is nicknamed the "Nature Island of the Caribbean".

Dominica is most famously depicted in Jean Rhys' classic prequel to "Jane Eyre", "Wide Sargasso Sea".

Dominica was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1493. In 1763, it became a territory of the United Kingdom from which its independence was received on 3 November 1978.

In August 1979, Hurricane David, the most powerful storm to hit the island, wiped out its entire infrastructure. On 21 November 2004, the island was hit by its most destructive earthquake in history; Portsmouth and the northern area were deeply affected.

In 1980, Dame Eugenia Charles became its prime minister, the first female government leader in the West Indies.

Dominica is an island nation in the Caribbean Sea. It is the northernmost of the Windward Islands.
