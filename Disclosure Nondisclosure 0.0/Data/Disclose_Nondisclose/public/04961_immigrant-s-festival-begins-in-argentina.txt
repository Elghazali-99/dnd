Immigrant's Festival begins in Argentina

The 28 annual Immigrant's Festival began in the Argentine city of Oberá, located in the center of Misiones. On September 6th, the inaugural parade began in the civic center of the city, and more than 15 collectivities crossed Oberá's principal streets showing their traditional wardrobe to visitors.

The parade culminated in the ""Parque de las Naciones"" with the current candidate for governor of Misiones, Maurice Closs, present. After 6pm, the national queen and the others authorities completed the traditional ribbon cutting ceremony, officially inaugurating the 28 Immigrant's Festival.

"We try to honor our forbears, their history, their culture, their music, their food; and also transmit to the young men who join every collectivity" declared Ewaldo Rinsfleich, the mayor of Oberá. "We hope that each person that visits us today and in the course of these days find and discover a corner of their past in the Parque de las Naciones", added the mayor.

On September 15th, La Mancha de Rolando, La 25 y Lourdes will do their presentation. On the next day, the national immigrant's queen will be chosen.
