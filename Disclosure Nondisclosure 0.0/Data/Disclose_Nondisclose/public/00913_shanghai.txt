Shanghai

Shanghai (Chinese: 上海, Shànghǎi) is China's biggest city, as well as one of the world's largest cities with 23 million people as of 2010. It is a municipality directly under the Central Government of China on the banks of the Chang Jiang River (Chinese: 长江, Cháng Jiāng), also called Yangzi River or Yangtze River (Chinese: 扬子江, Yángzǐ Jiāng). The river inlet around Shanghai is called the Huangpu River (Chinese: 黄浦江,Huángpǔ Jiāng).

The abbreviation for Shanghai is (沪) Hù.

Shanghai was not a major city until the 1800s, when it became a major trading port with Western countries. It is the biggest port in the world.

The French concession in Shanghai was where the Communist Party of China (CPC) was founded.

Today, Shanghai is one of China's most important cities. Shanghai attracts many tourists each year. Because Shanghai is so big and important and makes so much money, it is both a city and a province in China.

Shanghai, which means "“over the sea”" in Mandarin, used to be a small town where fishermen lived and worked.

It is home to one of two branches of the China Stock Exchange (the other being Shenzhen), making it the financial center of China.
