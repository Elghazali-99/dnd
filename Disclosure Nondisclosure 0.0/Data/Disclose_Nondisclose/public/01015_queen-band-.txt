Queen (band)

Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970, and are one of the most commercially successful musical acts of all time. The band members were Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar).

Freddie Mercury died of an AIDS-related illness on November 24, 1991. In 1997 John Deacon retired to spend more time with his family. The other two former members toured with Paul Rodgers from 2005 to 2009. Three of their biggest hits were "We Will Rock You", "We Are the Champions" and "Bohemian Rhapsody".

Queen were put in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001.

In 1968, Brian May was at college. He decided to make a band and teamed up with two other college students called Tim Staffell and Roger Taylor. They called themselves "Smile" with Roger Taylor on drums and vocals, Tim Staffell on vocals and bass and Brian May on guitar and vocals. They did a few hits such as "April Lady". Tim Staffell became friends with another college student, Farrokh Bulsara (to be later known as Freddie Mercury) and Farrokh became a big fan of "Smile" and encouraged them a lot. Later on, Tim left "Smile" to join "Humpy Bong" and Farrokh Bulsara subsequently joined the band on vocals and piano. Then Farrokh came up with the name "Queen", so they changed it from "Smile" to "Queen. They then started auditions for a new bassist. None of the auditioners managed to suit the place of the new bassist, but finally in 1971, they settled on John Deacon. Queen's first album was released in 1973 and it was called "Queen" with songs such as "Seven Seas Of Rhye" and "Liar". Farrokh Bulsara changed his name to Freddie Mercury after the lyrics "Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me" in "My Fairy King".
