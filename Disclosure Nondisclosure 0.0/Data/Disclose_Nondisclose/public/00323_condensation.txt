Condensation

Condensation is the process through which gas changes into a liquid when it touches a cooler surface. Condensation is an important part of the water cycle. It is the opposite of evaporation.

Condensation of water is when water changes from gas to a liquid or crystal shape. Any gas can condensate, usually at a low temperature or high pressure. However, condensation can technically happen at any temperature, as long as the pressure of the condensing gas is more than the pressure of the liquid state of that gas (both at the same temperature).

During condensation, the molecules in the matter slow down. Heat energy is taken away, causing the state of matter to change.

Condensation is vital in nature and is always the same as temperature and vapour pressure in nature. This means that if there is a lot of condensation, the temperature goes up. Alternatively, if there is hardly any condensation, there will be a temperature loss.

It is a useful process. One use is in the creation of “new water” (drinkable water made from drinkable sources). 
However, since there is a temperature gain when a lot of condensation happens, the heat may need to be "removed".
