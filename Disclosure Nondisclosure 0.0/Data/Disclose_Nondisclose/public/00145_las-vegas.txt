Las Vegas

Las Vegas is a city in the American state of Nevada. There were 640,932 people living in the city in 2015. It is the biggest city in Nevada. Las Vegas is also the county seat of Clark County. 

Native Americans, the Paiute tribe, first lived there. It was called "Las Vegas" by the Spanish. The name means "The Meadows" in the Spanish language. It had a lot of these in 1854. The city is known for its dry weather, as is the rest of southern Nevada. It is surrounded by deserts. 

The US Army built Fort Baker there in 1864. Las Vegas has springs so people used to stop there for water when they were going to Los Angeles or other places in California.

In 1905, 110 acres owned by William A. Clark, on which he built a railroad to Southern California were auctioned and Las Vegas was founded as a railroad town. Las Vegas officially became a city in 1911.

During the late evening of October 1, 2017, Las Vegas became the scene of the most deadly mass shooting ever in the modern history of the United States, when a gunman opened fire on country-music festival goers, killing more than 55 and injuring more than 500.
