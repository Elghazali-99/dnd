Vegetable

A vegetable is any eatable part of a plant that does "not" have seeds. For example, lettuce leaves are vegetables, because they do not have seeds. Carrots and potatoes are parts of the root systems of the plants, but since they have no seeds and are eaten by humans, they are vegetables. They are not in the same category as a fruit, nut, herb, spice, or grain. Though tomatoes are often thought of as vegetables, but because they have seeds, they are actually fruits. Vegetables are an important part of people's diet, (what they eat every day). Vegetables and fruits are sometimes called produce. Vegetables have vitamins A, B, C, D, minerals and carbohydrates.

The word "vegetable" can also be used to mean plants in general, such as when people say "Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral."

However, in an Asian context, 'vegetable' may mean any plant produce, apart from grain and nuts, that is consumed cooked, while only the fruits consumed raw are considered as 'fruits'. For example, an artichoke is therefore considered a vegetable, while a melon qualifies as a fruit.
