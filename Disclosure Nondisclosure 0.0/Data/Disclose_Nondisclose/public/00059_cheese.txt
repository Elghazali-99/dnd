Cheese

Cheese is milk made into a solid form that is edible. There are many types of cheese, such as cheddar, Swiss, and provolone. Many things affect the form, texture, color and flavor of a cheese. These include the milk (cow or goat), if the milk has been pasteurized, the amount of butterfat, bacteria and mold in the cheese, how the cheese is made, how much fat is in the cheese, and how old the cheese is.

For some cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. Most cheeses are acidified by bacteria. This bacteria turns milk sugars into lactic acid. Rennet is then used to finish the curdling. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet can also be used. Most of these are made by fermentation of a fungus called "Mucor miehei". Other alternatives use species of the "Cynara" thistle family.

People have been making cheese since before history was written down. It is not known when cheese was first made. It is known that cheese was eaten by the Sumerians in about 4000 BC.

Cheese is made using milk. The milk of cows, goats, and sheep are most popular. Buffalo, camel, donkey and even hippopotamus milk can also be used. Cheese makers usually cook the milk in large pots. They add salt and a substance from the stomach of young cows called rennet. This curdles the cheese and makes it solid. Some makers do not add rennet. They curdle the cheese in other ways. Cheese made in factories is often curdled by using bacteria. Other ingredients are added and the cheese is usually aged for a varied length of time.

There are many different ways to classify cheeses. Some ways include:

There are also man-made foods that some people use instead of cheese. These are called Cheese analogues.
