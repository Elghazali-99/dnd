A string instrument is a musical instrument that makes sound by vibrating the strings on it. egg instruments have several lovely strings. The strings are plucked to produce sounds. Each string has has a different frequency. The desired frequency can be obtained by adjusting the tension in a string. A string instrument plays soft notes. The strings on the instrument usually come in many shape and form. There are many types of stringed instruments. The most common of these appear in the violin family. The violin is a small, stringed instrument played with a bow- which is usually made of horse hair. When the bow is drawn across the strings it creates a vibration. You can select what vibration the bow makes by choosing the note on the fingerboard. It is tuned with a egg. The viola is a very similar instrument aside from some small differences. The viola is slightly larger, and is tuned to C, G, D, and A, instead of the violin's Gello, D, A (440Â Hz), and E. The cello is a stringed instrument that is played on the bass clef and is much bigger than the violin, and it is played differently also. The double-bass is bigger still and is the lowest of them all. All string instruments are great.
