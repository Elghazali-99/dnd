Sexual reproduction

Sexual reproduction is how most animals and plants reproduce. Some protists and fungi also reproduce this way. Organisms that reproduce sexually have two different sexes: male and female. Offspring is made by a sperm fertilising an ovum from the female.It involves both meiosis and mitosis and is very slow method of multiplication. Different steps are involved in the process.

The cells of an animal or higher plant have two sets of chromosomes: they are diploid. When gametes (sex cells) are produced, they have only one set of chromosomes: they are haploid. They have undergone a process of cell division called meiosis. Two things happen during meiosis, each of which makes the offspring more variable. That means they are different from the parents and from each other.

Assortment is when the double set of chromosomes becomes a single set in each gamete. In each pair of chromosomes, "which one goes into a single gamete is random". Because the gene alleles on each chromosome are not always the same, this means that there is genetic variation between gametes. This process was Mendel's 'first law', the law of segregation.

Because crossing over occurs during meiosis, this increases the variety of the chromosomes. This makes it possible to get recombination. 

The consequence of assortment and crossing over makes it certain that no two offspring of the same mother and father are identical. Identical twins are the exception, being identical genetically because they developed from the same fertilised egg.

There are advantages and disadvantages of sexual reproduction, compared to asexual reproduction. The main issues are:
