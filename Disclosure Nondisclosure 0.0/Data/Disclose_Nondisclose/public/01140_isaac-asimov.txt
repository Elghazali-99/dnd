Isaac Asimov

Isaac Asimov (January 2, 1920 – April 6, 1992) was a writer. He was also a biochemist with a PhD from Columbia University.

Isaac Asimov was born in Russia to a Jewish family. He was taken to the United States when he was three, and learned English and Yiddish as his native languages. He wrote many books. People know about Isaac Asimov because of his science fiction books and his science books for non-scientists.

Asimov's most famous books were the Foundation series. He also wrote the "Galactic Empire" and the "Robot" Series. He also wrote mystery, fantasy, and non-fiction books. He wrote or edited over 500 books and about 90,000 letters. Other subjects he wrote about were history, the Bible, literature, and sexuality.

Many of Asimov's early writings were short stories published in cheap science fiction and fantasy magazines. Years later, most of them were collected and republished as collections. Well-known collections include "I, Robot", "The Rest of the Robots", "Earth is Room Enough" and "The Early Asimov". 

Asimov made a list of 15 of his science fiction books, which he advised should be read in this order:

Numbers 1–5 are 'Robot' books; 6–8 are 'Galactic Empire' books; 9–15 are Foundation series books.

Asimov's novels have influenced science fiction on television and movie. Especially his 'Three Laws of Robotics' is a lasting contribution to our thinking.


Although ethnically a Jew, Asimov was an atheist:

When he had heart surgery in 1983, he received blood infected with HIV. He developed AIDS, and died of the effects of the medical condition in 1992. His widow did not speak of this until years later.
