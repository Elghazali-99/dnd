Tiger

The tiger is the largest living member of the cat family, the Felidae. It feeds by hunting. It lives in Asia--mainly India, Bhutan, China and Siberia.

Tigers have orange fur with black stripes and a white belly. The black stripes usually extend to the white underside. The stripes are used to keep them camouflaged while hunting. No two tigers have the same pattern of stripes. 

Sometimes there are tigers with different colours. There are white tigers that have white fur with black stripes. They have blue or green eyes. Most Bengal tigers have orange fur. The white coat only appears once in every 10,000 births. 
Tigers vary in size depending on their subspecies. Siberian tigers are the largest. Males can grow to at least long (body length) and weigh about . Females are a bit smaller. Record weight for males is claimed as 700 lbs (318 kg), but this cannot be confirmed.

Tigers can live in a variety of habitats. Mostly they need to hide, be near to a water source, and have enough prey to eat. Bengal tigers in particular live in many types of forests. These include the wet, evergreen of Assam and eastern Bengal; the swampy mangrove forest of the Ganges Delta; the deciduous forest of Nepal, and the thorn forests of the Western Ghats.

The tiger has 6 living subspecies, and 3 recently extinct (â€ ) subspecies.


Classified as endangered on the conservation status list, tigers are becoming rare, because people hunt them for their skin and destroy the habitats they live in. The Bengal tiger has the largest population with 3,500 left in the wild. To help keep the tiger population and the tigers safe, tigers are often placed in zoos. 

Tigers eat many types of prey, mostly other large mammals. Some examples are deer, monkeys, wild pigs, tapirs, buffalo and other animals found in Asia. All tigers are carnivores (meat eaters). Some tigers may eat up to of meat a day. Tigers kill their prey by clamping down on the prey's throat and suffocating it.
