Sexism

Genderism is generally defined as discrimination based on the gender of a personâ€”looking down on people because they are male or female. Sexism may also include stereotyped roles for men and women. International laws, such as Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women or Yogyakarta Principles demand to abolish any kind of sexism. Sexism could affect a person attending a party, getting a job, joining a game, trying to get a promotion, being selected and so on.
The women's rights and men's rights movements claim to fight sexism.

Sexism is often associated with discrimination against women due to the history of sexism in the western world.
