Aphrodite

Aphrodite (Greek 'risen from sea-foam') is the goddess of love and beauty in Greek mythology, and one of the Twelve Olympians. Many artists chose to portray her as a naked woman, or with very little clothing. 

The major theory of Aphrodite's birth was that she was the daughter of Zeus and Dione.
Another theory states that Aphrodite was born from sea-foam near Paphos, Cyprus. She appeared from the sea.

Aphrodite was very beautiful, which made Hera afraid that she would be the cause of fights between the other gods. She therefore gave Aphrodite to Hephaestus. Hephaestus was happy to be married to Aphrodite and gave her many pieces of jewelry which were gifts of love, like a belt that when ever she wore it made men would be attracted to her. Aphrodite, however, she was not attracted to him. So she spent most of her time with Ares, but was also spent time with Adonis and Anchises. She got married multiple times and had many children.
