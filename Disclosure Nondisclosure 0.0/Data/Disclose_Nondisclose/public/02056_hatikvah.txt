Hatikvah

Hatikvah (also transliterated as Hatikva, or, without vowels, H-t-k-v , "The Hope") is the national anthem of Israel. The song tells about the 2000-year-old hope of the Jewish people to return to their homeland, Israel. The song lyrics (words) were originally a 9-stanza poem called "תקותנו" (Tikvatenu), or "Our Hope," written by Naphtali Imber. "Hatikvah" uses only the first stanza and the refrain of Imber's poem. The last line of the refrain was changed, and the words were put to music. The music is from a very old--and very popular--folk song that Samuel Cohen, a Jew born in Spain, found himself humming one day. It is in a minor key, which is usually not used for national anthems, because it sounds sad, but the words to the song are about the Jews' hope that one day their sadness will be turned into joy.

כל עוד בלבב פנימה
נפש יהודי הומיה,<br>
ולפאתי מזרח קדימה<br>
עין לציון צופיה -

עוד לא אבדה תקותנו,<br>
התקוה בת שנות אלפים,<br>
להיות עם חופשי בארצנו<br>
ארץ ציון וירושלים.
HATIKVA<br>
Kol ʻod balevav penimah<br>
Nefesh Yehudi Homiyah<br>
Ulfa'atey Mizrakh Kadimah<br>
ʻAyin letzion Tzofiyah

ʻOd lo avdah tikvatenu<br>
Hatikvah bat shnot alpayim<br>
Lihyot am chofshi be'artzenu<br>
Eretz Tziyon v'Yerushalayim<br>
As long as in the heart, within, 
A Jewish soul still yearns, 
And onward, towards the ends of the east, 
An eye still looks toward Zion; 
Our hope is not yet lost, 
The hope of two thousand years, 
To be a free nation in our land, 
The land of Zion and Jerusalem.
