Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress

The Boeing 17 Flying Fortress was a heavy bomber, that was used by the United States Eighth Air Force during World War II. It first flew in 1935, and was introduced in 1938. It had a shorter range, and a smaller bomb load, than its sister bomber the B-24 Liberator, but it had more defensive arment. It dropped large amounts of bombs, and was also used during air raids against Germany, such as the raid on Dresden. The B-17 was also used in the Pacific, at the Battle of Midway. The flying fortress had its name for a good reason, it could take the hits and dish them out, being able to fly while under intense enemy fire. the B-17 was a heavy duty bomber plane that carried 2 tons of bombs. Not many B-17's survived WWII. It was the result of the lack of escortations of fighters. Although the Flying Fortress took down many opposing fighters they also took a beating. Later in WWII, the U.S. air force decided to add escortations to the bombers giving them more protection. The escortations lasted till the end of WWII.
