Dharma

Dharma (or dhamma) is part of many religions or spiritual beliefs that began in India. The oldest is Hinduism. Buddhism, Ayyavazhi, Jainism, and Sikhism also believe in the same idea. It means "the law" of spiritual growth of believers.

In Buddhism, the word "Dharma" also means the very old teachings of the Buddha. For example, The Four Noble Truths.

In Hinduism, dharma is the spiritual law for human beings. It is the way of goodness, truth and duty. For example, for a youth, a big part of dharma is to be a good student. Parents’ dharma is to raise and support their family. A teacher’s dharma is to teach, and the dharma of the police is to protect others. Each age brings new responsibilities, so dharma will change over your lifetime. It is everyone’s dharma to be honest, kind and religious, to do no harm to others and to be a good citizen. Hindus believe that following dharma fulfills the highest purpose on earth. When people follow dharma, they feel good about themselves, and life is most rewarding.
