Snooker

Snooker is a billiards sport for two players. It is popular in the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and parts of Asia. 

It is played on a large (12 feet by 6 feet) table that is covered with a smooth green material called baize and has holes or pockets in each of the four corners and in the middle of each of the long side cushions.
The players use long thin sticks called cues to strike the white ball (the cue ball). The cue ball must always be hit first when attempting a shot at the target ball. 

There are 21 target balls in total - 15 red balls (worth 1 point each) and 6 colours: a yellow (2 points), green (3 points), brown (4 points), blue (5 points), pink (6 points) and black ball (7 points). 

Each target ball must be aimed or 'potted' into one of the pockets in sequence. A red ball followed by a colour then a red ball again and so on until only the coloured balls are left. The colours then have to be potted in the following order: yellow, green, brown, blue, pink and black.

The player who scores more points wins the game or 'frame'. A match consists of an agreed number of frames.
