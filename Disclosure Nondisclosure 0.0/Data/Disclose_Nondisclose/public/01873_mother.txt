Mother

A mother is a female parent which gives birth to the baby after bearing and nurturing the baby in her womb for a period of nine months. 

A female can become mother upon having sexual intercourse with a male or through in vitro fertilization. As a result of these processes the female gets pregnant and embryo forms in her womb. The baby grows and matures physically inside the mother's womb for a period of nine months. At the end of this gestation period, the mother delivers the baby. The period of delivery is around nine months, though can be premature or delayed.

After the birth of baby, breastfeeding is a vital aspect of growing up the baby. As no other food is suitable for the new born baby, mother's milk forms an essential and the only suitable diet for the baby for few months. The breasts of mother produce the milk which is consumed by the baby for nutrition. Breastfeeding refers to the activity of baby sucking the nipples of mother's breasts for drinking milk.
