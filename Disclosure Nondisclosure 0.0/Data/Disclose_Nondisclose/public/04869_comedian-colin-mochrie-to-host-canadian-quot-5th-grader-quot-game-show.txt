Comedian Colin Mochrie to host Canadian &quot;5th Grader&quot; game show

Canadian comedian Colin Mochrie has been named host of "Are You Smarter Than a Canadian 5th Grader?", according to a Wednesday afternoon press release from Global TV, which is producing and airing the series.

Based on the American series "Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader", the program quizzes adults on material found in textbooks for children in grades 1 through 5.

Colin commented, "I have been from one end of this country to the other and met adults of all ages, and let me tell you... those 5th Graders have nothing to worry about."

Mochrie is best known as an improv comedian on both the British and American versions of "Whose Line Is It Anyway?", but the Second City alumni has starred in Canadian comedy show "This Hour Has 22 Minutes", "Blackfly" and "Getting Along Famously". He tours North America with "Whose's Line" co-star Brad Sherwood, performing at numerous locales.

The American series is hosted by Jeff Foxworthy. Thirteen other countries run or will run their own adaptations.

Mochrie will donate a portion of his paycheck to CanWest Raise-a-Reader, a family literacy program run by the host media conglomerate.

Only five episodes will be taped in Toronto, initially.
