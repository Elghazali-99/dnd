Honduras' Head of Congress illegally standing for President

Head of Congress is illegally standing in the February 20th internal party elections for President of Honduras, according to a group of 20 well known from the capital . This is because in the run up to the previous elections it was decided by the 5 presidential candidates, including fellow National Party member and current President , to support a ban on members of the National Congress from standing for President. This was in order to discourage people from using the Congress as a launch pad for their presidential aspirations. A constitutional reform to this effect was then passed by the Congress while it was headed by Mr Lobo. This law appears to have been conveniently forgotten until yesterday when these lawyers made a public announcement calling on both The Supreme Electoral Tribune and the Public Ministry to determine the illegality of Pepe Lobo's candidacy, and to act in the case of his not being allowed to stand.
