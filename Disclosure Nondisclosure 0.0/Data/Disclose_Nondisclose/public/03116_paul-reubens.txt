Paul Reubens

Paul Reubens (born Paul Rubenfeld; August 27, 1952) is an American actor, writer, movie producer, game show host, and comedian, best known for portraying Pee-wee Herman. He is of Jewish descent. He appeared in many movies and television series in the late 1970s and early 1980s and worked with a group called "The Groundlings". Around this time, Reubens created Pee-Wee for a stage show, which was a parody of old kids programs. In 1985, he starred in a movie called "Pee-ee's Big Adventure", which was very successful. The next year, he got his own television program, "Pee-wee's Playhouse". It was very popular. 

He was born in Peekskill, New York and grew up in Sarasota, Florida. 

In 1991, Reubens was arrested for masturbating in an adult movie theatre. This ended the Pee-Wee craze and forced Reubens to stop playing the character. 

He has since appeared in many other movies and there have been rumors that he would return as Pee-wee. These rumours have not been denied by any official.
