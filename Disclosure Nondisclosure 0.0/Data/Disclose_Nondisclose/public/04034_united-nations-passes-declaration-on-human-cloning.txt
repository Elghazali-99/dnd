The vote, held Tuesday, came after four years of debate and an end to attempts for an international ban.

In the 191-nation assembly, there were 84 votes in favor of a nonbinding statement, 34 against and 37 abstentions.

"But this confusing declaration is an effort to mask their failure last November to impose a treaty on the world banning therapeutic cloning."
