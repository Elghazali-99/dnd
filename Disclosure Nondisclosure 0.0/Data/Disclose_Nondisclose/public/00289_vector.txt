Vector

A vector is a mathematical object that has a size, called the "magnitude", and a direction.

For example, a vector would be used to show the distance and direction something moved in. If you ask for directions, and a person says "Walk one kilometer towards North", that's a vector. If he'd say "Walk one kilometer", without showing a direction, it would be a scalar.

We usually draw vectors as arrows. The length of the arrow is proportional to the vector's magnitude. The direction in which the arrow points is the vector's direction.




The Head to Tail method of adding vectors is useful for doing an estimate on paper of the result of adding two vectors. To do it:

It's called the "Head to Tail" method, because each head from the previous vector leads in to the tail of the next one.

See link for an example created with Java.

Using the component form to add two vectors literally means adding the components of the vectors to create a new vector. For example, let a and b be two two-dimensional vectors. These vectors can be written in terms of their components.

formula_1

formula_2

Suppose c is the sum of these two vectors, so that c = a + b. This means that formula_3.

Here is an example of addition of two vectors, using their component forms.

formula_4

formula_5

formula_6

This method works for all vectors, not just two dimensional ones.

The dot product is one method to multiply vectors. It produces a scalar. It uses component form:

formula_10

The cross product is another method to multiply vectors. It produces another vector. Using component form:

formula_11

Here formula_12 means the length of formula_13 and formula_14 is the unit vector at right angles to both formula_13 and formula_16.

To multiply a vector by a scalar (a normal number), you multiply the number by each component of the vector:

formula_17

An example of this is
