Benjamin Harrison

Benjamin Harrison (August 20, 1833â€“March 13, 1901) was the 23rd president of the United States (1889-1893).
He was the grandson of William Henry Harrison. His home was in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was a member of the Republican party. He was elected to the White House in 1888, beating Grover Cleveland. Harrison is the only president to be the grandson of a former president. Harrison was the first president of the United States to use electricity in the White House. After Benjamin Harrison served one full four-year term as president, Cleveland ran again and, this time, beat Harrison. 

Benjamin Harrison's first wife was Carrie Harrison. After Carrie Harrison died, his second wife was Mary Dimmick Harrison. During the American Civil War Harrison was a Colonel in the Union Army (later a brevet brigadier general). Benjamin Harrison was also successful lawyer. He argued many cases before the United States Supreme Court.

Benjamin Harrison as president wanted to increase tariffs (a tax on goods that come into the country) for two reasons:

Harrison spent the money received from the tariffs to give money to injured American Civil War veterans.

Harrison was the first president to have a billion dollar budget for the government. People criticized him for that.

He also signed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act which gave the U.S. government the power to regulate big businesses. 

Harrison did not use that power much.
