A young Austrian woman named Maria Rainer becomes the governess to the children of Captain Georg von Trapp, a widower. There are seven of them - they are Liesl (16), Fredrich (14), Louisa (13), Kurt (10 - almost 11), Brigitta (9), Marta (7), and Gretl (5). Maria teaches the children how to sing, during the famous song "Do Re Mi". The captain and Maria fall in love and marry. The Nazis want the captain to be a part of their navy. He does not do it, instead planning a daring escape from the Salzburg Festival, where the von Trapp family singers are performing. He eludes them, and leads his family to safety over the Alps to Switzerland.
