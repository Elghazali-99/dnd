1 (number)

One (1) is a natural number after zero and before two.
It represents a single item.
A human typically has one {head, nose, mouth, and navel (belly-button)}.
The Roman numeral is I.

In mathematics, one is also the only number with this special fact: Any number multiplied by 1 equals that number.
Then, the number 1 divides any number but it is not divided by any except itself. The number 1 divides any number to give that same number but it cannot be divided by any other number to give one as the answer. Let "n" be any number. Then "n"/1 = "n" but 1/"n" is never 1 (when n is not 1). Example: 7/1 = 7, but 1/7 is not 1 (it is 0.142857...).

Any number divided by itself always gives 1 as the answer. "n"/"n" = 1 (when n is not 0). Example: 7/7 = 1.

0.999... is a repeating decimal that is mathematically equal to 1. Many proofs have been made to show this is correct.

The number one is important for computer science because it is, together with zero, a part of the binary numeral system. In machine code and in many programming languages, one means true and zero means false.
