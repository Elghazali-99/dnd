Guatemala is the world's largest producer and exporter of cardamom.

It is the country with the largest population in Central America. Its neighbors are the countries Belize, Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras. More than fourteen million people live in the 22 Guatemalan departments. Most of the population is made up of mestizo (mixed race) people, who are a combination of Native and European people. The population of the Mestizo people make up 42% of the population. The native Mayan people make up for 39% of the total population, while 20% are direct descendants of Spanish and German people.

Most people believe that Guatemala City was the first choice, but the capital was moved several times. This was caused by the natural disasters. The first city was destroyed when the volcano Volcan de Agua erupted, forcing the move to what today is called Antigua Guatemala. This was destroyed by earthquakes. Finally, the capital was moved to what we know as Guatemala City.
