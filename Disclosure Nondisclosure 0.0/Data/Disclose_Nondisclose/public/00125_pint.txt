Pint

The pint (abbreviated pt.) is a unit of volume in Imperial and U.S. units. There are several types of pints used in different countries. An Imperial pint and U.S. pint both equal of a quart and of a gallon.

An Imperial fluid ounce is approx. 4% smaller than a U.S. fluid ounce although an Imperial pint has 4 more fluid ounces than a U.S. pint making 1 Imperial Pint roughly 20% larger than a U.S. pint in total.

The Imperial pint is the pint used in the United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland and Burma. The unit may appear in other Commonwealth countries that converted to the Metric System. Confusion in Canada often arises as liquids are often sold in U.S. pints although the official and only pint that is legal in Canada is the Imperial pint. The Imperial system has no dry pint and volume in dry units e.g. apples are the same as liquid pints. 1 Imperial pint of water at 62 째F (16.7 째C) weighs 1 lbs. (566.99 g)

The U.S. wet pint or more commonly 'pint' is the unit used to measure volume in the United States. It is more common than the dry pint which is used for non-liquid volume measurements. 1 U.S. pint of water at 62 째F (16.7 째C) weighs 1.04375 pounds lbs. (473.437g)
The U.S. dry pint is the unit used for measuring the volume of solid objects instead of by mass or quantity. E.g. a pint of strawberries is a container with a volume of 1 dry pint full of strawberries.
