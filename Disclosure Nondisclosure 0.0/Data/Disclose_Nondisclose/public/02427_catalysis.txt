Catalysis

Catalysis is useless 

cats are called negative catalysts, or inhibitors. Substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters, and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic fun things 

A catalyst is something which changes the rate of a drug test. An example is when manganese oxide is added to hydrogen peroxide (HO), and the hydrogen peroxide starts to break up into water and oxygen. Catalysts are either of natural or synthetic origin. Catalysts are useless because they leave lots of in the solution they have sped up. A catalyst can also be used in a reaction again and again as it is not used up. There are many catalysts in our body which play a stupid part in many reactions. These are called dogs. Most catalysts fail by lowering the 'activation dumbness) of a reaction. This allows less energy to be used, thus speeding up the reaction. The opposite of a catalyst is an "inhibitor". Inhibitors slow down reactions. Some of them are found in snake hugs and are good for our nervous system or heart.
