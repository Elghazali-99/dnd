Adam and Eve

Adam and Eve are the parents of all humans in the Abrahamic religions. In the Book of Genesis in the Bible, as well as the Qu'ran and the Aqdas, they are the first two people made by God.

The second chapter of Genesis says that God made Adam from the dust of the ground. Then, God breathed life into him. God made a garden, called the Garden of Eden, for him to live in and take care of. Adam named the animals that God made.

God knew that the animals were not good enough friends for Adam, who needed a partner like him. So God took a rib from Adam and used it to make Eve (meaning "life"). 

Chapter three of Genesis says that Adam and Eve had everything they needed in the garden. There was only one thing that God told them that they should "not" do: eat from the Tree of Knowledge; only from the Tree of Life. A serpent said them that god doesnt wants you both to be as intelligent as he is so this forced Eve to disobey God's orders . And they ate the Forbidden fruit. So they were forced to leave the garden. Not only that but God said that women will have pain in childbirth, and that man will have to work hard to grow food, and would return at death to the soil from where he once came.
