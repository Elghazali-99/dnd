Deforestation

Deforestation is when forests are destroyed by cutting of trees and not replanted.Sometimes deforestation happens when people change the land into farms, ranches and cities. A lot of deforestation is caused by the removal of all the trees from a forest for wood or fuel. Without the forest, the habitats of the animals are lost and many animals die. It also results in global warming (climate change).

Deforestation is the removal of trees. As population grows, people remove more trees. They use the land to make farms. They also use the wood from the trees as lumber to make buildings and other things, or they burn the trees as firewood. Sometimes, forests are lost because people want to make cities bigger: this means building roads and buildings on the land where the forests are. Sometimes deforestation may be caused due to increase of population.

Forests have the following functions:-
 balance in the atmosphere

Forests are often planted to protect against natural disasters. When forests are lost, very often the soil they protected is also lost. This loss of soil is called erosion. 

Trees are also important for carbon sequestration. When the trees burn or rot, the carbon in them returns to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, deforestation causes global warming. Tropical deforestation is responsible for about 20% of world greenhouse gas emissions.
