This all started about 2 years ago when I wasn't feeling well and went to the Doctor and he took my blood pressure and it was 165/100 He was very concerned and had me take my blood pressure at home.  The Ranges were still very high 145/95-165/110.  I'm 27 Years old so he was very concerned. I started to have recurring symptoms: Flushed Face, Headache, Anxiety, Hands Shaking, Back is hot to touch, Chills, Elevated Temp., Racing Heart, Constricting Feeling when talking in Head, Nausea, Sweating when sleeping, Sleep Deprivation. He put me on a Beta Blocker-It brought my blood pressure down but still the same symptoms, then he tried a calcium Channel Blocker-Same Symptoms, then an angio tension blocker and the List goes on.  I've had every Blood Test in the Book, I've had an MRI of the Brain and MRA of the head and Neck.  2- 24 Hour Urine tests, Sed Rate Blood test, growth hormone blood test, CT scan of my stomach looking for Adrenal Tumor-Negative, Echiocardiogram-ultra sound of heart-Fine. So many tests yet the symptoms remain, there are times when I feel better and then the symptoms return.  I don't feel great just a little better.  Now I'm on the Clonidine Patch and I switch back and forth from half of a patch to a full patch(it's the lesser of the evils), these symptoms go away for a little and then randomly without warning come back. So now My Doctor thinks it would be best to go to mayo clinic, He diagnosed me with Anxiety and I'm talking to someone about it, yet my physical Symptoms are very bad.  My Doctor says that all my symptoms are exactly what an Adrenal Tumor Symptoms would be but they can't find It. That's why he wants me to go to Mayo.  I just don't know what to do at this point in time.  This whole thing has me Emotionally Depressed.
