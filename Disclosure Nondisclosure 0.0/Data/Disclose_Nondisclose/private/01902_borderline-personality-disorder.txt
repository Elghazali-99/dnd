Our family counselor has announced during a session that my husband was borderline he told us that if he could get away with things that he would. I left Travis in May and I'm still feeling like I lived a dream for the 4 years we spent together. I would have never imagined things would have went to the extremes they did and how it would feel to loose track of myself.  We married in a church took classes converted to the Lutheran faith together, not even a month after we married he was trying to have sex with my best friend, I found traces of him seeking out male for male hookups on craigslist personals. The worst was that he was on a leading sex site registered in 2 swinger clubs and he had videos that were top rated for me to view him in so many different acts it would boggle your mind. The information was validated by a detective and he confirmed all of this to be true. He has told everyone I'm unstable and nuts and continues to deny his bisexuality. Does anyone have any experience with this and to these levels or advice when we will start to heal?
