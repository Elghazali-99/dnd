I am so frustrated. I have spent my whole evening calling anxiety/ depression/ OCD helplines to get help and really all that is out there is just if you are suicidal.  I am not suicidal, but have had major stressors this past year to include health problems to a custody battle.  My depression/ anxiety/ and now OCD which I never knew I had is spiraling out of control.  An OCD activity that is recently come on is I have started counting letters in words and sentences on my fingers and they have to equal a multiple of five.  I have major insomnia, because every time there is silence this need to count letters and rearrange words and sentences overwhelms me.  My primary doctor has tried helping me fight my depression/ anxiety with a lot of different medicines.  She wants me to see a psychiatrist to get better help with getting the right medicine.  My problem most psychiatrists in my area are not seeing new patients or it takes months to get in to see them. 
In the mean time all of my mental health issues are getting much worse.  I am having panic attacks, severe neck and back pain with stressful situations, insomnia, quick agitation toward friends and family, loss of interest in any activities, etc.
This is affecting my job, my relationships, my health... etc.
How do you get help quickly without being suicidal? I want immediate relief from this and wish I could be seen tomorrow. 
Any suggestions would be appreciated!
