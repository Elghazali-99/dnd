I'm a 15 year old girl in 10th grade at the moment. I've been struggling this year, much more than my last year because I've been taking honors classes. I noticed that it is harder for me to concentrate this year, and it began to worry/ stress me out. As the weeks continued my memory began to worsen, making me have to work even harder for my desired A's. At the point where I am now, I have no motivation to do work at all, making school tedious for me. This is yet again another reason why I'm struggling. Recently, I looked up my symptoms and I was shocked to find that I may have depression due to stress. Could this be true? Also, I did suffer a traumatic event during the summer that had to keep away from parents so I was very stressed out about that. I've been trying to manage my stress on my own, by thinking about my issues and then telling myself I can do them. I've been conversing with my peers more often, and talking to them about my stressful. But, I kind of want help from a professional. I don't really want to go to my school nurses either, I just want some advice on what I should do. I want to make sure I don't want to suffer anymore, I'd like to be back in control of my emotions and doing the best I can to pursue my goals. Advice is completely appreciated :D
