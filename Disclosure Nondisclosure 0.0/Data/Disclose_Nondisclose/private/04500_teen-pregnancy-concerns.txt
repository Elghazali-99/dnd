Okay so I'm 15 and my boyfriend and I did some things about 3 weeks ago. His semen was in my mouth and then we madeout and then he went down on me (Sorry that this is so gross I'm so worried I want a good answer). He stayed on my clitoris while doing it. We have NEVER had intercourse.  I don't keep track of my period, but they usually come the third weekend of every month, except last month I think it came on a thursday but whatever. My period is supposed to come sometime this weekend and it hasn't. I realized this on Wednesday that my period is supposed to come soon. So the usual me I flipped out and I look up all the early pregnancy symptoms and I have none of them. I have vaginal discharge and it is normal. I cannot stop thinking about this whole situation and I babysat all last week which was so stressful. I am aware stress can delay your period but it's constantly on my mind. Only my best friend knows about this, and I refuse to tell my mother because I don't want to disappoint my family, it's one of my biggest fears and it is the worst feeling. Please help somebody. :(
