I am going through a rough patch and have been for quite sometime. I live with my boyfriend who has depression (extreme at times; no he is not medicated or diagnosed). Anyway I am sole supporter financially for over a year now; he hasn't worked in a bit and finding employment hasn't been easy either anyway we are about to loose our home and have to move in with family and we are not happy about this not that this is bad just inconvient. Anyway I have found myself going into shut down mode. I guess this is the way I have been handling my stress level which is at it's max right now but I feel guilty because I know this doesn't help my partner and puts him in a more depressive state. I feel like I enable him by doing everything and not pushing him to do things for himself. I have taken prescribed medication (prozac and zanax) because of a condition I have; I take the zanax as needed and have not taken the prozac in a very long time.. Anyway it's the disconnected feeling I am having problems with - some days (more than I'd like to say) I know I am here but feel miles away. I sometimes feel like I am looking out the window of my own body; I know I should feel something but for the sake of not having an argument, or feeling guilty I shut it down and now I have no idea of how to feel anymore physically or mentally. Any suggestions?
