My father got Delusions schizophrenia for long time but Not too serious. It get serious since last 3 years. However, unfortunately we were not aware of his mental problem till 6 months ago. since that time he visits doctor, And his doctor gave hime Dogmatil 200 mg. it causes to reduce his stress, and feel better. But I do not see any positive result on his delusions. he still thinks that everybody around him are trying to make problem for him. he thinks that somewhere like central intelligence agency of my country trying to abuse him or make any problem for him or his family, however we are living in a different country. Plus, from few months ago he suspicious to my mom and brother, and now he considers them as their enemy( he is quite sure that they are from CIA and spy him all the time). all these mean that he dosent get better at all. 
I want to know whether he get better if i change his medication to Risperidone 2mg ? I seriously need help as his mental disorder is getting worse day by day. I scare soon he count me as his enemy as well.
