to accomplish in the last 30 years. I am now going to a shrink soon, I am sick and tired of being told I am bipolar when all I am experiencing is cognitive blunt from seroquel. Family, sick and tired of knowing I am in the family, Long story short. I am going to go off of all of it if the Psych will give the go ahead and monitor me. Its almost destroyed my mind taking all of these meds, first in 80 I took lithium and something else it was weird, heard voices and did not know what to do. I have become quite cynical and have shut all my family out, except for one person. I am tired of the labels and ********. I know I am not syhizophrenic and have suffered from pstd since the rape in 1982, have had night mares about it and know I have remembered it correctly. Family says they do not want to hear about it, sorry, it happened and was never addressed back then. Family said I was unstable and did not want to hear about it.
 I have been patient all these years, first with lithium, then lorezepam, I went off the lorezepam all by myself a few years ago, since I was doing  social drinking, it never made me sick, I am amazed at the ability of my body to bounce back from it. 
I am fully aware that Psych's do make misdiagnoses when a person has gone through serious trauma, but my trauma's are always blamed on me, people say you did not take your meds correctly, didn't take them at all, when its not the case. 
 I do always end up lashing out out of desperation when I take so much I cannot stand it, I contend that pstd is the culprit and will go back 30 years of Dr;s and Psych Records to prove it. I am not alone, I know I am not, in the attempts to have others see that I am not sick in the head, and am fighting for my life, I know psych drugs do cause symptoms of diseases when given without the need for them.  Any feedback,will be greatly appreciated.
