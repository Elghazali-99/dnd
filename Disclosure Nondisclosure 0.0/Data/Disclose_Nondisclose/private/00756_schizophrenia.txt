Hello. I used to come here for support when I was first diagnosed as Bipolar 1. I was 16 I believe. I used to ask a young man by the name of "paranoid cataclysm" for advice..A very active member of the forum. It has been years since we talked but I do remember that I did gain a lot of helpful insight. I am 19 now, and am taking abilify for Bipolar 1. I have been experiencing bouts of psychosis, as well. The abilify has taken away the extreme mood shifts. I am on 2mgs. However, now I am just hallucinating..I have to go back to the hospital so I can go back to work. Though I feel it will be hopless, and I very well may be schizoaffective (Dr's have been going back and forth with those two diagnosis..) I was wondering if I could talk with young adults who are high functioning...When I leave my house..the ground shifts. Shadows animate when I try to sleep. People smell..just godawful. Everything is so damn loud...Recently I smelled a mans colonge and the smell stayed in my sheets for days, my hair. I just scrubbed myself..lit insence...so unclean. I did not realize this was a delusion until I brought a friend over and the smell suddenly vanished. It was never on me at all. But all I did..was smell it. 
 I am rambling, its quite hard to sleep. However, I am a go getter. Being schizophrenic..it runs heavily in my family..It would ruin my life. My hallucinations, my sensitivity (hypervigalence) is just getting worse and worse..It makes me want to vomit, cry, scream. 
 Hell, I am young, thin, I model, I work, I help my mother, my grandma with advance stage dementia..I want to be a nurse...I cannot live with this on my shoulders. I need help. I have to go back to the hospital tomorrow. I think my apartment..the walls are trying to kill me...I am such a burden. I am expected to live sort of by myself...Make income!
 Okay. Had to let that all out. 
 TL;DR HELP IM A 19 YEAR OLD FEMALE SCHIZOAFFECTIVE WHO USED TO HAVE A BRIGHT HEALTHY FUTURE AHEAD OF ME. ****!...****...
