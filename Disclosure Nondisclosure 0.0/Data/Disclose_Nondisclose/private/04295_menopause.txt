I posted recently saying that I was getting a lot of heart skips and that I thought it might be part of peri menopause.  
 So this morning my heart is skipping away, I'm carrying on as normal because the cardiologist said to, and then I'm walking home, slow pace, pass by the shop and buy a multi pack of milk chocolate.  I decided milk chocolate might be better for me than the 70% dark stuff, to lower the caffeine....
 I get home, make a cup of tea and eat one bar of chocolate.  Before I know it I've eaten all four bars!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I swear to you I'm not really a pig, lol, something else is going on with me.....all I know is that the minute I ate the chocolate, the skips disappeared, my energy came back and I generally felt better....so I ended up eating all four.  I've never done this before.  
 Now I feel well enough to think about doing things, going to events, etc, that I haven't been doing because of all my symptoms.  But it's a temporary effect from the chocolate.
 I've tried to work out what it might be.  An anti depressant effect?  But I'm otherwise happy and motivated, the only problem is how I feel physically.  The magnesium in the chocolate maybe?  But surely I would get much more in the 70% stuff I usually eat.  
 Its ridiculous that eating all that chocolate would stop the heart skips when one would expect the opposite.  I wish I understood what was going on because I can't just carry on eating like that, it's unhealthy long term.
 Anyone else understand what's going on?  :-)
