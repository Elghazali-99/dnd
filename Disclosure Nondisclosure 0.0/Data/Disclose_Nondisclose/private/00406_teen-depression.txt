i have always been down, i was diagnosed with social phobia a few years back and i have a psychiatrist whom i see every wednesday. I can't stand the way i feel anymore. I just want to go to sleep and not have to wake up anymore. I really hate it. Nothing good happens, i can't even have fun with my boyfriend anymore. I'm so scared of what i am putting him through, he shouldn't have to deal with what ido to him and everyone around me. There is no one i can talk to anymore, i don't want people to know how i feel, i don't want to be that pathetic wreck that can't stop crying and shuts herself in her room for days on end. I want to be normal. I hate feeling so depressed. I never understood the difference between upset and depressed until now, there is nothing anymore. I can't handle going to school, i refuse to talk to my parents or my family. I just wish that for a day i wouldn't have to deal with this. Please does anyone know what i can do? I cant talk to my psychiatrist because he doesn't know this is how i feel. I just want this to stop. Can anyone help me?
