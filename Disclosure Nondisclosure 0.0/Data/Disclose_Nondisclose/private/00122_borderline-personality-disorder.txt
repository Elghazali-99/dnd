After hearing myself and others refer to dealing with my daughter as "walking on eggshells" I was browsing a bookstore and found a book by Paul Mason and Randi Kreger called Stop Walking on Eggshells.  On a whim, I picked it up, read the back cover and thought 'my God, this is her..."  I purchased the book and started reading the symptoms and most of them rang true to what myself and others have seen in my daughter.  Unfortunately, we don't know how to point out the difficulties that we and others have because we really don't want to anger her because of the ways she responds to things that we point out.  I haven't read that far into the book to know if it deals with confronting a person who we feel meets the symptoms that were described, but will hopefully continue reading and find something to help us.  She's a wonderful young woman, talented, intelligent and very giving and loving in most situations...it's the other situations that are playing havoc on us.  She and her sister were both sexually abused by their father...I've learned that it wasn't my fault and have learned to not take the blame for what he has done...but her sister has dealt with what happened and we feel that she has not.  Can anyone give us some suggestions on the best way to get her to seek first of all, a true diagnosis...then some treatment...so that we can see her happy and content with her life and not prone to create drama or ruin normal adult relationships that she tries to establish, and recognize that she needs help?
