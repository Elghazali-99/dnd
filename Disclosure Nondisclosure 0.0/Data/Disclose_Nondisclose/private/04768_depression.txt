Hi all, did not know where to turn. I have been googling like crazy to see if anyone has faced this type of depression but could not find it.
 Let me give some context: I suffered from anxiety and depression about 4 years ago. It lasted about a month then I was able to get through it until recently...
 The story: I went on a backpacking trip to Asia with 3 other friends for about 16 days. We travelled to 5 different countries and hopped on 8 different airplanes. For the most part it was fun and exciting! We did a lot of cool stuff like seeing temples, petting tigers, going out, and even going to Tokyo Disney! Then other parts were just stressful and built up a lot of anxiety and missing home! Some stressful things were hopping on different airplanes, going from 1 airbnb to another, hot weather, riding on planes with turbulence, you name it! By the last 4 days I was already to go home. I had a series of panic attacks that put me on the edge. I was so excited to go home! By the time I got home I was happy to see my family, my girlfriend, my dog, and heck, I was happy to go to work to be back on my routine!
After effects: It has been a month since I got back but I still feel very depressed. I feel sad and lonely and lightheaded. I even went to the doctors because i thought I was getting a tumor in my head or something. I feel very anxious and thinks theres something wrong with me.
 I was wondering if anyone has felt the same why I have after coming back from a long trip like I have. Will this pass? Or will this last forever? Is the cause of this anxiety and depression feeling from my stressful trip? If so, why has it only been starting now?
 Thanks again for reading my story and helping me out. I really appreciate it.
