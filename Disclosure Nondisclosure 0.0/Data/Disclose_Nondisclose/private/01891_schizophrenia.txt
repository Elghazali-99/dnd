I am a 22 year old male suffering from some mental problems I am posting it in the schizophrenia forum because schizophrenia is the closest thing my sympotms match beside dementia. My symptoms are inability to think abstractly, have no thoughts in my head aka as poverty of thought, whenever someone asks me a question nothing comes into my head its empty and its effecting me at work and makes it hard to make friends. At work the people around me are talking and i just cant think of anything I am blank at its likee this at all times I cant even talk to family members its like this when I am alone. I have a hard time retaining information no matter how hard I try I will repeat it over and over write it down and never stays its like it is erased from my mind, i have trouble learning. I was placed in special ed in high school could I be mildly retarded? I was seeing a psychiatrist and am looking for a second opinion, I was on meds and supposedly being treated for psychosis but i never hallucinated before nor was I delusional. I am literally disabled I cant pass job interviews because of the severe thought blocking. My psychiatrist never addressed these issues i told him i feel liek i am mildly retarded or think I am but he said I cant prescribe you meds for that so whats the point in me telling you your retarded. Sorry for the long drawn out message but I just cant think my mind is empty it feels broken I lost who I was what could it be? i have had all tests imaginable mri, ct scan and eeg and they all came back normal.
