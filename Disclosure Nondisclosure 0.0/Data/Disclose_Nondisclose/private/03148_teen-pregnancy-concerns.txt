Hello, I'm 13 years old and i have missed 2 period I'm stressed out because I don't really know whats happening at the stage in my life.My boyfriend and I have not done anything AT ALL and I'm not really planning on doing anything either.
I told my Boyfriends sister and she said its normal but I'm not just having "period cramps" I'm having back pain my feet are swollen and I've been very moody for the last couple of day. My mother is a nurse she says its normal for time to pass by during your period, I want to believe her Educated opinion but I want to see a doctor. my boyfriend got me 3 pregnancy tests. The first one was negative the second one was positive and the last one was negative I don't know what test to believe I don't know what is happening. Please help! I did not tell my Mother or Father about the pregnancy test. My boyfriend's Mother and Sister are the only ones who know about the test because I took the tests at his house. I cannot be pregnant right? is it possible? I'm only 13!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE ANSWER! I NEED ANSWERS! Thank you
