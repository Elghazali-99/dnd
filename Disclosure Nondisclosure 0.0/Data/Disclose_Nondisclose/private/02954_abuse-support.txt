Im concerened for variouis reasons. I had an anxiety attack about 6 months ago and I felt really horrible for a really long time, felt like my body just wasnt working the way it should. 
I hadnt had another one sense last night, then it happened again, I woke up in the middle of the night shaking, couldnt breathe, that kind of thing. Now today, I feel at times that I cant breathe, almost have like a choking feeling, and my stomech and around my abdomen hurts at times, and I also have slight pain around my heart area at times. Last night, I felt almost naucious and felt as though I was going to puke, but not quite. 
 I asked my mother about it, and she keeps reassuring me that theres nothing to be worried about, and that my heart is perfectly healthy. I want more of a professional opinion though, I am just way to scared to try to go to the doctors. 
 I have reasons to believe that it could be anxiety because I dress differently from others, I get called all kinds of filthy names, And ontop of that, im gay.
 I will not tolerate slander, just offer advice and help.
