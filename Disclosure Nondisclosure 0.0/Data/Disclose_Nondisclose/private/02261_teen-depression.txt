About a month ago i started crying to a friend because i was stressed out because of college decisions (im currently a graduating senior) Its not normal for me to get emotional. I figured i was tired and had alot going on since its the end of my senior year. The end of that emotional week i got a fever and became ill, which was strange because i havnt been that sick in many years. The week after that i couldnt eat, so i went about a week without eating. Sometimes i feel very alone because alot of my friends are in relationships and i spend time home alone. There is one person who i got to know very well a couple days after i got sick, and the problem im having now is that i cant seem to want to be with anyone else. I feel i want to see her and talk to her every second of the day. Sometimes i start to feel emotional and try to think of an excuse to text her at night. Ive skipped classes during the day at school to go see her (in another dept. Of the school) which is not like me at all, i never ever skip class, nor have i ever felt so emotional. Ever since this stress, ive been waking up early every morning, aroun 5-5:30 even on saturdays, compared to normally waking up at 7 or 8. Am i becoming depressed, or just stressed out?
