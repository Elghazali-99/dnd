I believe in BHRT and need it.  However after using the gel prescribed by my doctor I ended up with a huge red, itchy vagina.  The itching reached unbelievable heights where I thought I was going to go insane because I could not stop the itching.  I got off the hormones even though the doctors said it could not be them.  I talked with the pharmacy and they said it was probably the gel base.  Once the itching and redness subsided I went back on with a creambase supposedly non-allergic.  I started itching again, less intense and without the real redness.  So I'm off again and still feeling tingly and occasional itching but not any where near the intensity it was.  However, I really liked what was happening to my body while I was on the hormones (minus the itchy problem).  My anxiety was gone as well as my sleep issues.  My slight depression I had started to feel and the crying episodes where gone and I could have and wanted to have sex again.  Why wouldn't anyone want to stay on these hormones......its all good.  However, I am off them now because I feel they are causing the itching.  Does anyone have any idea why this would happen, if it was the wrong combination of hormones, the wrong base and why I am still feeling this tingling sensation and occasional itching?
