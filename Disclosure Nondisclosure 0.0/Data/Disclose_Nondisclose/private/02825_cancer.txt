I recently had an MRI of Brain done because of suspected MS. I am 49yrs old. This is what my report revealed. Can someone PLEASE make heads or tails of what this report means? I am unfamiliar with all of the terminology and can not find very good resources via the internet. I just want/need to know what it is exactly that I'm dealing with. I've had many strange symptom over the past couple of years but they have gotten particularly bad over the past several months.
 The tectal plate and inferior pineal are diffusely enlarged, and increased in signal on FLAIR/ T2 images, decreased in signal on T1 precontrast images. No appreciable enhancement on the postcontrast T1 weighted images. Findings are worrisome for tectal glioma measuring 1.9 cm(craniocaudad) by 0.7 cm (AP) by 1.0 cm (transverse). This finding is best shown on axial images 8-15. Other considerations include a PNET, ganglioglioma, ependymoma, or primary pineal tumor. There is associated abnormal increased T2 and FLAIR signal extending into the posterior thalami and down along the Brainstem into the deep posterior pontine white matter. Findings are worrisome for edema or gliosis related to tumor. 
No other lesions are present worrisome for tumor. No deep periventricular white matter lesions worrisome for demyelinating disease. 
ANATOMY: no congenital anomalies. Normal vascular flow voids. Pituitary fossa normal. 
CSF SPACES: normal in size and contour. No hemorrhage. No aqueductal stenosis. No hydrocephalalus. 
CEREBRUM: no evidence of hemorrhage, mass, or extra axial fluid collection. No abnormal enhancement post contrast. 
POSTERIOR FOSSA: internal auditory canals, cerebellopontine angles, mastoids normal. No enhancing lesions. No abnormal enhancement post contrast. 
DIFFUSION IMAGING: negative for acute or subacute infarction. 
ORBITS: no masses. Globes normal. 
PARANASAL SINUSES: no fluid levels. Mucosa normal. 
OTHER: no other significant finding. 
 IMPRESSION: findings worrisome for Brainstem glioma.
