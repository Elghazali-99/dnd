Hello, I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for but here's my story in a nutshell. I'm 28, mother of 2, been with my partner for 7 years. The ENTIRE time we have been together I have been telling myself I should leave, I truly think guilt of hurting him is why I've stayed...we don't compliment each others weaknesses, go on dates, support each other in the day to day, or even generally get along, but when there is a big issue we seem to be able to come together and figure stuff out. But I day were friends at best - that have a really good sex life somehow - this is possibly another reason I've stayed as it is really really good. I know that's no reason to stay and I have known the whole time yet I stay! We've tried 2 different counsellors, I've tried one on my own - tried all their tips but the results were nil. We've had a couple good patches but I'm talking a very short time...I know that if the following things were not a factor is leave him this instant: he will be devastated and likely move to be closer to his mom, he might look to drugs, he has my friggin name tattood on his ring finger (I didn't know what to say when he suggested it but wasn't keen on the idea), I worry about our kids, and I worry he'll try to reconcile and I couldn't handle that because he can be sweet and kind he just only does it when his back is against the wall...am I a lunatic for this - is guilt a normal reason to feel trepidation in ending a relationship that is basically just friends?! Do I continue to try?! (Not looking for an answer I know it is me who needs to decide I'm just so lost right now) Anyone in a similar frame of mind, and come out the other side happier? Thanks for taking the time to read this :) anything you can offer will be accepted...
