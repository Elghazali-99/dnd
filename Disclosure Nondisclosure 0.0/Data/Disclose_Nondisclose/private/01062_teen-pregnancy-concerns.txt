We've never done penetration. I said "spreaded by **" is because she is giving me ** then she said she can taste *** so I presume it's a precum but then afterwards I fingered her. So I'm being paranoid is that what If I touched my **** with my fingers? my **** is all wet and slimmy so I presume the precum was spreaded and then inserted that finger to her vagna? I CANT REMEBER! But the only thing rest assured is that I've never cummed on that instance I mean we've finished our sexy time without me cumming because my sister came into our house and that's why my gf needs to leave. Is the semen in the small amount of precum still alive when she's giving me ** for about 30 secs to 1 minute? then I can't remember if I touched my d*ck but IF I touched my d*ck with my fingers and I fingered her is the semen alive? She's 3 weeks late now but she is also irregular that's why I'm being paranoid so much! I REALLY NEED CREDIBLE ANSWERS WITH EXPLANATION GUYS :((
