am I depressed? I took two surveys and they both said I have high depression. I've recently lost a good friend, it was completed my fault because I was just out of it but I'm slowly realising that I might actually need her. I'm very lazy my parents have picked up on they shout at me and hit me sometimes this morning my mother called me a a gronk over and over again making me feel worthless. I'm so insecure about being called ugly lots of girls at school said I'm ugly but "as a joke" lots of people have told me it so there must be a truth behind it. A few years back when I was 6-8 (I'm 13 now) I overheard my neighbours and my mum they're really close talking about me there was nothing wrong she suggested taking me to see somebody I'm not sure for what but they suggested taking me places I'm pretty sure that's permanently scarred me now. I didn't need any help then now I think I do. Usually all I do is just ruin stuff not even intentionally I'm always being ratted on by my younger siblings. We just finished out exams and I found out what I got on Islamic studies it was either 3/8 or 3//10 I studied for that exam I didn't study for my other exams such as English math geography and that stuff. Now I'm really anxious whether I'm moving to hear 8 or not.
