How can I change relationships with my Dad. 
If I cry he tell me that is a manipulative and immature behavior.Why is not okay to cry, I feel like I can't be myself around him anymore. I all I ever hear is the mistakes I make, I never hear anything that I do is right they always have to point out my mistakes never what I do right. I never do anything good enough so I think I go the other say
I wrecked the wood floor because I mopped it with water, they never told me how do it and if course he says he would never do that, I don't believe that he has never done stupid stuff like that and he would never admit that ever made mistakes to me. You don't have to yell me and I don't wnat to listen when people yell at me and swear. Why can't people do it in a nice way say don't do that next time. 
I know I need change, but they don't accept me for who I am but I have to for who they are . Why is not it okay to cry why does see this behavior as manipulative and immature. He keeps telling me I am too stubborn and so he is not always listen to what people tell him. I can't change how I react to situations and I am never taken seriously. How do I change how they see me andI can't change my behavior, I don't accept,they change. He doesn't need to yell at swear at me when I make mistakes, Why can't he ever tell me what I do right.
 I am not looking forward to holidays. I dread holidays these days. I feel like anything I do for him wouild not live up to his standards.
 Why can' he accept me for who I am.
I guess I am not capable of anything anymore but making mistakes and being stubborn and immature.
 The only one who accepts me for who I am are the dogs.
