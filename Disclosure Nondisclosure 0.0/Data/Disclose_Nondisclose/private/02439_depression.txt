i am having horrible thoughts....ive always been a very nice person, feeling guilty for little things, careing about those who suffer, respecting every person i have met unless they show me disrespect....but now with my anxiety and depression i have been having nasty thoughts......
 about 1month ago i saw a story on someone who killed his family.....i later on that day had like a quick mental image of me harming my mom...i immediatly felt like a nasty guilty feeling....i had no physical intent on harming her or anyone else it was just a quick thought...but i cant shake it off know i avoid knifes as much as i can and i dont really know why.....i feel so scared to go insane or harm my family and those thoughts haunt me!
 i hate it i always tell myself that you are incapable of doing anything like that, but then right after i start to think if you are 100 percent sure that you wouldnt do harm to anyone then why do you think about it??and then i guess it all goes in circles...its really scary someone pls help!!
