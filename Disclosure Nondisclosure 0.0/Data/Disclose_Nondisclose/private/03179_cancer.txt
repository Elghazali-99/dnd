Is this lump or bump or whatever it is caused by cancer?Today this morning I woke up to my mothers constant crying. She said that the she had a bump behind her ears. The bump is causing her bad migraine problems and she says that half of her face is numb. Unfortunately she doesn't have any health insurance. So I want to make sure is it caused by cancer or not. 
 She has a history of bumps/lumps that she complain is very painful, but eventually the pain stop. She has a lump on one of her breast and one on her back( as far as I know).She said that she had been diagnosed with precancerous cells before, but she doesn't have insurance soooo.... 
  Anyway I hope this is not caused by cancer. she has work today and she is deciding if she should go to work or not. I said and go the clinic( but she doesn't have insurance). 
  I don't think she has cancer in her lymph nodes even though that is basically how cancer cells travel.Could it have affected her body that fast. The bumps earlier describe hasn't gotten any bigger or bother her. It is just there. But this new bump is painful since it is near her bran/ nervous system which may have been caused by lymph nodes. 
  So is it cancer? In reality there is nothing I can do to help her but to ask questions. Insurance is a really mysterious.
