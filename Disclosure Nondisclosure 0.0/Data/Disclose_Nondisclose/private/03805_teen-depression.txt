I am a 16 year old girl who thinks she is suffering from depression. Lately I have completely changed. I feel like the whole world hates me, and are laughing at me. I burst out into tears at random times; even if I just had a great day or experience. My relationship with my family is completely destroyed. I cannot have a conversation which them without screaming or crying. I feel like they hate me and regret having me. I also feel upset and sad. And I am ashamed to say whenever I feel like this I cut myself. I have 4 permanent scars on my wrist. As I do it I feel better but afterwards I hate myself even more. I really am afraid I might be crazy. I am not doing anything like drinking or taking drugs so it cannot be a side effect of something like that, 
I constantly feel tired, and like to lay down in the dark, and sleep. My parents think I am being bullied at school and keep on threatening to call the school. I am not and when they threaten to do this it makes me more angry and more sad. I feel like I am in this constant loop. I think I may be depressed. I am confused because I thought if you were depressed you were constantly sad. But I have some happy moments when i am with friends or the rare occasions when I am actually not fighting with my parents. Which rarely ever happens. 
Am I seriously depressed or just a typical teenager? The self - harm is what makes me worry. But I am not addicted to it. Please, please help me and give me some answers. 
Thank you.
