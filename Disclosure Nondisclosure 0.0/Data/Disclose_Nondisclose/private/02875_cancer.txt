I have these 2 smooth ovular bumps connected to the side of where my wisdom teeth are but higher up in the mouth where my soft palate is. They don't necessarily hurt but when I tried to find out what they were called (since i've had them for as long as i can remember 3+ years) and they've never gotten any bigger or smaller. To my surprise these are apparently not supposed to be there because all that was coming up was cancer and everything else you can find while trying to self diagnose. There is no redness, they are the same color as the roof of my mouth but are large and on both sides of my mouth near the back on the roof on the soft palate, what are these? they are solid, they feel as if they are bone when i track my tongue across them and I can feel when i touch them with my tongue both on the bump and on my tongue so it has feeling. I'm really kind of scared but I cant go to a dentist because I have no coverage anymore, im 21 and unemployed so I don't have the money to get it checked out. If a picture would help  with a diagnosis I'd be glad to provide one...
