I've been with my boyfriend for a little over a year now so it's fair to say that I know his family pretty well. His aunts are all amazing and sweet. But his mother just isn't with it. She was a flower child(lots of drugs). We this might have something to do with it. I've met people with schizoaffective disorders before as I've been hospitalized myself for other mental disorders. However, this woman seems to take the cake. She doesn't go to any kind of mental health clinic or private psychologist/psychiatrist. 
Her son has severed ties with her due to her having him arrested multiple times and an active restraining order but she'll call me and ask me to bring him over. Then I call her back 5 minutes later and she freaks out saying she would have never said that because she's being watched. The thinks the police and FBI are at the end of her driveway 24/7. 
There's a rather obese homeless woman that the became aquatinted withe sleeping in a car in her driveway. She has no cell phone or gas money as she has no job so she rarely ever leaves(once a week if that). She believes this homeless woman is a police officer and is watching her. She "sees" people "watching her" everywhere she goes whether it be a doctors appointment or probation(she stole from Walmart and got a DWI) or the groceries store. 
She's on 80 mg of methadone a day (pain) and 8 mg of Xanax. I think that this has something to do with the way she acts sometimes. But even when sober she's called the cops on her son because she thought he stole her money or pills because in a paranoid state she hides them and instead of trying to find them she accuses him. 
Anyway my question is this symptomatic of some kind of schizophrenic disorder? If so what actions are recommended?
