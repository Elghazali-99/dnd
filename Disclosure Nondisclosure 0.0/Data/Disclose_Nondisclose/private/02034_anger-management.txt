Hi,
I am a 28 year old male. Up until my latest gf i have never been told I had an anger issue. She is going to school for psychology. Lately it seems like all we do is fight about stupid ****. She says its me and that I have an anger problem along with mood swings. I know I have anger problems in certain areas but I am not abusive or anything like that. Its just that we fight and fight then make up a lot of the time it is me, getting frustrated possibly annoyed by things she does. Things that upset me or triggers some kind of annoyance. We have been together about a year, shes younger than me, not sure if that matters. We are both not jealous don't fight like that. 
 For years from 15-22 I was heavy into smoking pot, drinking, occasionally cocaine and taking acid. I have been clean of all except pot. I am not sure if any of this has to do with me possibly having moodswings/anger issues. I am not even sure if I am the problem like she points out or if its her craziness. (she has fibromyalsia and ICS, on lots of medication, plus she has stress issues). One thing that she points out is that everything she has to say I turn it around to make it sound like its her fault! I have read many articles some things seem to hit home. I don't know what to do. Its starting to make me feel like im insane being wrong about things!
