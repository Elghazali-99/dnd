. going to vegas soon, problem, if i go to casinos and this club, standing in line for club  paying to go in being in club will be reminded. strip driving down a starbucks, what to do. in car will be reminded.
this is a girl dating,we don't love each other, didn't know each other spend enough time together. thought it could lead to something more.  At first  I  said when we meet in vegas after weekend see how it goes. take it from there. she was talking about and me relocating, her me he moving my way, if it develops to realationship. during time talking second meeting end of month in vegas she says I live to far before she didn't think that. , then why below is she saying she found man of her dreams and in love with this guy she just met two days later after I met her in vegas ? it takes time to develop feelings for a guy. she claims below she has with some guy, and he live far, she says he agrees with everything she says. come on, man a man can't agree to everything, conversation would be no fun right?  after coming back vegas, next day she online,. i was doing strecthing   and martial arts left computer on, and she says don't you wanna talk to me? I told her above. and that i do want to talk to you. I don't call text girls everyday.
During interactions before first meetiing, she always asking me our you dating? did you lay anyone? second meet up during that time. She thought I was jealous cause asking her about guy she with before. When i left vegas first time meeting we spend few days, vegas, sex, , she at first said above, see how it goes. and possibilty. move some point. some time after she says, I only want fun and that's it.When leaving first time she thought i was mad bout something . i wasn't. made mistake sometime after over stupid disagreements. saying i wasted my time  meeting you wasted condoms on you. she somehow met me vegas end of july a second time. problem, before meeting her in first place. She told me about being affectionate, in public. i never did that, held he hand briefly walking around and in car, same with second time. last thing told her face book, you were rude, it was over something she told me , way she answered. few minutes after i wrote back saying. you don't know me enough to really know me.   she sees me before close friend  friend with benefits, she had sex with this guy friend who lives in her town. thought only time girl has sex is either with her boyfriend husband, a  guy just met like a date. also 17th. she told me i don't want to be your friend, I replied , really wow that's nice. and later below stuff.

hi lorena, hope you doing well. So anyways, you think I don't want to talk to you. not true. Just because I did not answer you on chat next day after vegas. I was stretching doing martial arts. I did call you a couple times each day like twice once per daymissed call you got. You don't want to be my friend? Then what do you want to be with me? You said I was your number one in private, Just cause I didn't respond next day to you all of a sudden… See All
