35 year old female, no history of trauma or abuse. Symptoms of anxiety and bipolar likely began in childhood, which are currently controlled with meds. However, I am worried the depression part is not being adequately treated (or maybe I have another disorder?). Ever since my 20s, I have become more detached and socially distant. Very few close friends, and I have gone weeks if not longer without contact with them and felt okay about this. My family are alright people, but my mother is the only one I have regular contact with. I am not married and childless, and I prefer this. (Sorry for the tangent here)...I do sometimes feel attracted to others, but seldom date because they are either unavailable in some way, or I am simply too caught up in the fantasy world to care. Don't know any other way to put that. 
As stated earlier, I honestly do not believe I had an experience in my past that caused this. I also doubt I have Schizoid PD because a) alot of interests  b) I think I react normally to praise and criticism  c) I am pretty expressive about my emotions. ;)  
In the past, antideps nor therapy helped this. Am currently on Buspar for anxiety and low dose Trileptal which is a mood stabilizer. Maybe I need my psych to increase this?
