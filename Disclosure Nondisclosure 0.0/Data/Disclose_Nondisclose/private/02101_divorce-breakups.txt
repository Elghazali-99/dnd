I've known for a while my husband is mentally, and emontiinally abusive.  I love him but I don't the abusivness.  I have a son who will be two in April.  We skntreally have anywhere to go, my dad is passed away, my grandparents on both sides don't want anything to do with any of us grand kids since the passing of my dad and my papaw(my mom's dad) and my mom moves around all the time and I know she won't be able to take care of us as I've been put in the situation and she doesn't really talk to me, she has my two brother and my sister to take care of, my older, you get brother is about to have a baby in November, so that adds more to them.  I want to let but at the same time I don't.  I just need some advice from someone who has maybe been in this position or knows someone who has and how they made it through leaving them, and how they done it with nothing?  I don't have a job or G.e.D or high school diploma, I don't have a car or nothing at all. My husband won't let me keep any money on me bc he's afraid I'm going to save up and leave, he checks my phone and everything bc he's afraid I'm going to find someone else or talk to someone else.  I just need help on what I could do please?
