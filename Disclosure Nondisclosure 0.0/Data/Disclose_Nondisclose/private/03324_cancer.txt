Totally in misery and need anyone to tell me what I should do here.  I have kidney stones - which suck the big one and don't get me started on that conundrum..  but the CT also reported I had some other snafus in my situation.
 Which - hey.  I am sure we all walk around with all kinds of cysts and whatnot on a daily basis and I think getting a CT scan at any given day might make us freak out - but this sort of is nagging at me.  I DO have an appt at the Gastro guy on Tuesday - but honestly I just want to hear if it is worth going.  I am feeling so awful with the kidneys that I truly do not need another appointment on my plate - but hey.  If some new friend on this (awesome) forum gives me the kick in the butt to keep the appt - I shall go.
 Here is what it says:
 Mild prominence in transverse dimension of the common bile duct, common hepatic duct, and intrahepatic bile ducts is seen slightly increased in degree compared to the prior exam. There is also mild prominence of the main pancreatic duct. Therefore, a distal common duct stone, stricture, or ampullary lesion cannot be excluded. Nephro
lithiasis is seen without ureteral calculus or ureteral obstruction. No
focal renal parenchymal lesion is identified. There does however appear to be suggestion of mild diffuse thickening of the wall of the urinary bladder and cystitis cannot be excluded. 
 Googling isn't helping so I just thought I would leave this here :)
