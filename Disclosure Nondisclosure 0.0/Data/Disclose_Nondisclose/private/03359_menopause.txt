Hi, folks-- I'm post-menopausal, couple questions. Hadn't had a period for 1 1/2 yrs., then got 5 days
light bleeding/spotting/cramping. Have also had more hot flashes, etc. the past 6 months, after
going for about a year (thankfully) with very few. How often does this happen (late/isolated "period")
to women this far post-menopause? Had 2 abnormal Pap tests (May and Oct.), HPV negative in May
(Digene test) and HPV High Risk positive (Cervista) in Oct. (Then I asked for strain-specific HPV 16 
and HPV 18 test on the sample, which came back negative.) Dr. did colposcopy since had "precancerous" lesion
that was treated w/ 2-stage cautery about 34 years ago; no cancer, lesions, nothing out of the ordinary/unexpected given my age when she did the colposcopy in Oct. Guess the HPV Cervista could have been a false positive. How often are the doctors seeing false positives in post-menopausal women? I do have risk factors--early age of 1st sexual intercourse, multiple partners, high stress lately which could reactivate a dormant virus from what I understand--but have been mutually exclusive with husband for 25 years. Thoughts? Feedback? Thanks!
