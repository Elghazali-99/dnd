first off, when i went to post this i saw  8 different types of abuse. In a nutshell will someone please tell me the meaning of them?  ECONOMIC,EMOTIONAL,SOCIAL,SPIRITUAL,SPOUSAL, AND VERBAL.  second, i feel like my fiance of 4 years emotioanlly abuses me. he always talks down to me and never lets me be entitled to my feelings.  the other day we were talking and he said i started to get worked up(though i didnt feel that way) so he went on the defense(i felt for no reason). when i told him to please stop talking to me that way, he just kept going.  making me feel like i was worthless like i do nothing for him.  i slapped him.  i know it was wrong i felt bad but then he started to call me every name in the book and punched my rear view mirror and broke it.  he left. i found out from a mutual friend he told his whole family that i had been beating him all week and this time i beat him, punched him, pulled a box cutter on him and kicked him out of a moving vehicle. 
 we have talk since then.  he blames the whole fight, as well as ALL our fights, on me. i told him to move out until he can take responsibilities for his actions.  he turned it around and said he wont come back because of my violent attitude and i just need to calm down.    Am i supposed to take the way he talks to me?
