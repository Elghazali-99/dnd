first off, if you respond to this question, i thank you. its been bothering my for quite some time. i have never been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but i have been diagnosed with "bipolar" and "depression with psychosis". However, my symptoms fit freakishly well under "schizo affective disorder". i know its wrong to self diagnose but it honestly is the closest ive come in matching my symptoms with its. now my question is, can schizo affective disorder come and go without the help of medication? both times in my life in which i have experienced severe symptoms of what i think is SAD, but what others have labeled "severe depression" or "bipolar", the symptoms have come on and left with seemingly no cause. is this normal? and will these symptoms of "craziness" come and go through out my life??? i wont go in to detail, but the paranoia, delusions, and pain is too much to keep going through. Also, the medications have seemed to only make me worse, i feel as tho once i stop them, things seem to get better. truly. it is very strange. i feel im super odd.
