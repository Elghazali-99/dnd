It has come to my attention that I obsess and over think things without expressing my feelings to anyone. It has gone so bad that I cannot focus on my daily routines, activities, work, etc. I work slow, I take a longer time to feel motivated. If I get away from my friends or family, say to go to the restroom, I really do it just to think and try to solve a problem that isn't there so that way when I go back out, I can completely enjoy my time and connect with those around me instead of pretending to be while I'm thinking of something else. What can I do to stop this habit? Is there a nedication I can take? I have Access insurance, so I may be able to see a doctor. The only reason I avoid doing so is because for some odd reason my insurance mistakened my date of birth, which is probably connected to another person under the same name as mine. But anyway. . . I just really want to know if this is anxiety? Could it be something else? It's REALLY easy for me to get triggered by certain subject matter, but I am proud to say that I have learned to manage it. I admit that I still have my rough patches, but I have learned to steer clear of certain situations or at least if it is inevitable, I calm myself down.
