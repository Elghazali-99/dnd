everyone wants me to get out party and have fun fall in love and go on happily with my life.  It is not like that.  I am sick.  I have a headache bad.  loud noises hurt more. bright lights hurts more.  when I walk very far.  I have dizzy spells I break out in a cold sweat and it is so bad water runs down my neck and my face.  I have to sit down.  I was with my best friend.  we were in big lots.  I was just fine.  she was looking for a card and I was looking foe a birthday party.  I told her I felt funny.  she said I was staring at  her and I just fell gently to the floor.  I got back up and said I really don't feel good.  and out I went again.  I started to get up again and I felt a hand on my shoulder and he put me in a wheel chair,  she said I passed out 3 times.  she took me home and we never went shopping again.  I love her she is a dear friend.  during the evenings  my headaches get worse.  nothing helps it I have taken 2 tylenol no effect.  I took 2 benedril in case it is a sinus headache.  no help.  I walk very far my legs ache and I get so tired I can hardly stand. the back of my neck is always hot and stiff and hurts.  I don't feel like walking 5 0r 6 miles to the library.  I would not even make it down the block.   I am sick.  no one wants to believe me.  I am tired of all the pain nausea and the acid reflux.  I don't feel like being around anyone.  it is embarrassing.  who would want a friend that cant do anything they are sick and don't feel like it.  far as being in love again never could I ever love anyone like my hubby.  I will not betray him.  don't feel like eating most of the time.  I stay nauseated most of the time.  right now I am sick my head is busting.  took two benedril pills and a pain pill I am still sitting here.  mo relief. I have had no food or drink all day.  thanks for trying to make me young again but it just not me. I am sick.  mandy876
