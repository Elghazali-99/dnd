A very dear friend of mine endured a few years of abuse by someone with undiagnosed BPD. There was emotional, verbal, physical, and sexual abuse that took place. My friend held on, thinking he had no choice but to "help" this person. He complained about the abuse, said he wanted his life back, but still stayed with the person. She was downright nasty to him, but in the same sentence would say "I love you, why don't you understand that?" Knowing now that she has BPD sheds some light on her behavior. Yet, my friend is still devoted to this individual. This person moved away to a safer place for her, but my friend keeps going to visit. He recounts episodes of being thrown across the room and screamed at...I even heard it for myself one day over the phone. How do I support my friend? I don't feel right telling him what to do or that he should just ignore her. I know it's harder than that. I don't really know what the relationship is; they're not lovers, they never dated..."just friends" is all I hear. But why, then, does he "put up" with her behavior. He says he's a strong person for all he's put up with. But he does nothing to protect himself. Sometimes I think he expects the same behavior from me; I can tell he's "on the lookout" when I'm with him. I try very hard to respect, encourage, and understand him. Is there more I can do? He won't go to therapy; he doesn't think HE has a problem.
