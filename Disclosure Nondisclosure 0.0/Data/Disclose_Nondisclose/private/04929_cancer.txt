Hi, Iv'e had a hard lump on my chest for the last 9 years, as long as I can remember. First started to notice it in high school and has sense been really self conscious about it, and worried that It could be cancer. X rays and ultra sounds done on it and nothing came up in either but it's clearly visible that it's abnormality. The doctors did say that it appeared that some rib damage on the side correlating with the lump; so to put myself at ease thinking it was a mis place rib or something. It hasn't really grown much in years past. It feels round smooth with no gaged edges and it's connected to the rib so it could be possible it's costal cartilage swelling.
  I can go on and on about my theories on it but I can't seem to get a Dr to say anything else but that "I was born with it" and I clearly wasn't. So if anyone has a lump fitting the description or knows what it could possibly be please respond to this post. I will also link pictures of it for proper comparison. Thank you^^
