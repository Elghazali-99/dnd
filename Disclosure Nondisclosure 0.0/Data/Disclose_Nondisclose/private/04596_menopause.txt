Sence i can remeber my period has been off the first couple of years i was right on, then lil by lil it came almost never i went way over a year almost two before i seen it, then i met a guy and started having sex regularly, and it came almost to a t. I started having it when i was in fith grade then freshmen year i just stop getting it. I get really bad hot flashes everyone jokenly says maybe thats whay i dont get my period becuse i am going through menopause. I am 22 yes 22 and some of u may laugh at me but, sence i stopped having sex. my period has almost not come at all. It will be 7 months soon. I dont know what to do, I am moody, and my sex drive is hot then cold. My grama is or has been going through menopause sence she was in her late 30's. What should i do. NO period, Hotflashes, Loss of sex drive, also got my first pimple sence i was in middle school, and although that dosent seem like such a big gap, the fact that the last time i had one was when i was 12 and i am now 22....(my grandmother got a lil acne when she was going through the  cahnage)any way i would love any help u could give, i know there r cases where girls go through it early, and i feel rreally silly going to the doctor to ask if i am going through menopause.
