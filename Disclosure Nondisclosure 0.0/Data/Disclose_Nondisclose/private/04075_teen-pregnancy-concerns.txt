On March 21st and March 29th I had unprotected sex while on Junel birth control. I had my period from March 24th through March 27th. Yesterday, May 5th, I had pain in my uterus that felt like ovulation. However, I know this shouldn't be happening because I am on the pill. Today, along with a little less of that pain, I am having brown, thick discharge. I've read that sometimes the horomones in the pill a gal takes might not be strong enough and can therefor cause breakthrough bleeding. But I've also read that this brown discharge can be a sign of implantation and pregnancy. 
I am very concerned as none of this makes sense. I do not want to be pregnant, which is why I am on Birth Control in the first place. 
I have serious anxiety, so hopefully someone can help me pretty quickly! 
Do I need to get a pregnancy test? I'm too afraid to go to my parents while I'm still this unsure because they think that I haven't had sex in a couple months. (I broke up with the last guy but am seeing someone else without them knowing)
Thank you.
