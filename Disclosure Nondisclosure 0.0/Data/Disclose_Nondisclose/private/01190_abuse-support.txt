I couldn't even figure out what topic category it goes under because it is all just a mess. I absolutely hate my father: he is abusive, in every manner including physical. After being beaten about 3 years ago my mother is finally letting me see a doctor since they are going through a divorce. He still says the extremely mean things i wish u were never born, ur the biggest mistake, fat, ugly, the list just continues. My mother just takes my younger sisters side(15): she can hit me, yell at me, insult me and that is just fine in my mothers head. My mother is just getting worse as the years go on. She yells that i am a waste of life, and I work multiple jobs and go to school. I never am good enough, never am right and they just insult me, hit me or scream at me. 
 I always want to scream and cry and just run away but none of it is worth it cause I have nothing in life. I am trying my make myself a life but I dont know how much more I can take. 
 I do not know what to do anymore.
