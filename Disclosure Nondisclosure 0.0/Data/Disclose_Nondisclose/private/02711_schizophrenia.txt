I am confused about what it is I have, I think my pysch and parents don't want to freak me out but I would like to know what my disorder is if anyone could help?
 Really quick i'll start off with my meds: Seroquel 50 mg to sleep, lamictal 400 mg, prozac 20 mg, and wellbutrin 300 mgs.
 I suffer from depression to the point where before I was on meds all I could do was sit on the couch, and that was me giving an effort instead of just laying in bed. I am irritable,sad,angry, and happy all at the same time.I cant sleep at night without seroquel..i will be up til 5 am just thinking no matter how much sleep ive gotten. I would see shadows out of the corner of my eyes, like people watching me from behind.I tell myself that everyone no matter where I am are thinking bad things about me. I obsess over things that make me feel uncomfortable and it will just replay in my mind all day everyday. I repeat thoughts in my head of how much of a bad person I am. Ive been suicidal but too much a chicken to actually do anything. One week in class I can be the class clown and the next week feel too uncomfortable to speak to anyone. If the phone rings its going to be bad news, the thought of having to wake up tomorrow makes me tired. I have "weird thoughts" about the brain and how life really is and can never put my mind on pause. Ive hallucinated twice, one was caused by a natural sleeping aid.
 Thats just a breif summary... can anyone help?! thanks :)
