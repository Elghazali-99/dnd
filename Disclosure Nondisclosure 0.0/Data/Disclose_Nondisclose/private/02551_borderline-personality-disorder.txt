I've been diagnosed with Bipolar II by my Pdoc (he doesn't believe in the diagnosis of Borderline) and although my family doctor doesn't want to interfere he's more inclined to think I'm Borderline.
 I have a family history of physical and emotional abuse.  I used to come home from school sometimes and start getting my hair pulled and my head bashed against the wall for unknown reasons.  When I'd ask why I would get hit even harder because apparently I was supposed to know the reason.  (I'd later notice I put my slippers in the wrong place or something else like that.)  I've been called a **** from a young age (even before I actually had sex).  I initially resisted this label until I finally internalized it.   To make a long story short my reality to what was presented to me was always in conflict and I've had a lot of problems knowing what's real and what's not.
 Recently I've been feeling out of touch with reality again.  It's kind of hard to explain.  Everything around me just feels surreal and I don't feel connected to my body.  I feel like I don't know who am, how I should act or what I stand for anymore.  I have this overwhelming feeling that something bad is going to happen but I can't define what that bad thing is.  My chest is tight and I'm unfocussed.  I frequently feel like this when I'm having conflict as I always second-guess my decisions and myself. Is this part of BPII or does it seem more similar to Borderline?  Is my insecurity causing me to feel crazy and out of touch?  
 I was doing really well on 200 mg of Lamictal but now I’m not sure that the drugs were helping after all.  Right before this episode my self-care had started to deteriorate and I was no longer exercising, meditating, journaling and eating well and I’m wondering if that’s the cause.  I’m scared to go to my Pdoc because I’m afraid that he’s going to either increase or put me on stronger meds.  Any thoughts?  Has anyone else experienced this?
