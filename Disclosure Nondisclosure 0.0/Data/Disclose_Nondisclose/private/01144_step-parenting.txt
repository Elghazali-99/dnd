I know this might sound crazy and even heartless,but i assure you it is the total opposite of that. I have major issues with my husband's babys mama. She is a mean, vindictive, awful person. I don't know what my husband was ever doing with her. Their daughter is 9. We have court ordered rights and get her every other weekend and a day through the week, etc.  She is the sweetest thing (she gets that from her dad). I really care about her and we have a pretty good relationship. But i have this underlying resentment towards her that i feel so guilty about. I feel like if she didn't exist, we wouldn't have half the problems we have. Paying the lawyer, custody battles,  child support, struggles with her mother, etc. I look at her sometimes and see her mother and wish that my husband and i only had our child together.  (We have a one year old daughter together) I never ever take my feelings out on my stepdaughter but i dont like thinking of my husband and that witch together.  I don't like her calling or texting him even tho its mostly just about their daughter. I dont like her trying to dictate every little thing about her daughter when she is his daughter too. Im afraid she talks bad about us to her even tho we have strict rules between ourselves to never talk about her mom in front of her. She texts him and says i am to stay out of matters concerning her daughter when this is my life too! I cant stand her breathing. I have anxiety about her all the time and i just feel if their daughter never existed,  then my life would be so much easier and happier. How do i overcome these feelings and move forward?? (Reconciliation between her mother and me is not an option at this point) help....
