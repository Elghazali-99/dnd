Almost every day my daughter is sent to student support. For various things mainly for spitting, hitting, teachers and students. She even will bite her self. she has made threats that she will hurt her self and others. She doesnt listen for nothing. She acts like it is a game. Im am so tired of dealing with these behaviors. She hurts her younger brother, pushed him down the stairs before, and threw our dog down the stairs as well.  I have thought of admitting her to sphyciatric hospital but not sure if that is the right decision. her primary doctor hasnt prescribed any thing for meds. She has been diagnosed with adhd and we havent had her on meds for it. We will be soon enough however the teachers feal its more than just adhd.  today she even had an accident in her pants while screaming in student support.  She is in a special school now cause her other school basically had her removed with my permission of course. however it seems her behaviors have worsened because of  the other students being just as bad or worse.  I just was wondering if you had any suggestions
