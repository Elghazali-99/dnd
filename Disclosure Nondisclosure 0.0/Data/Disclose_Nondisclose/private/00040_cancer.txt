Hi and thank you for taking the time to read my post. I have been seeing doctors about my leg pain for over two years. Just my right calf is swollen and seems to have a lump in it. They diagnosed me with fibromyalgia which I don't agree with because at he time the only pain I had was leg pain and chronic fatigue because I am always exhausted. Then they did ultrasound on both legs to check for DVT but it was negative. I recently became sick with a cough and they did a chest xray and found increased markings and then did another one a month later and same findings...both radiologists recommended CT scan doc says he doesn't think I need it and to wait another six weeks for another xray. Now I am having pain on my shoulder blade I didn't have an injury to it haven't seen the doc yet. Also I failed to mention before the leg pain began I had a lumpectomy because I had a lump that came back atypical after biopsy. They never gave me a script for mammogram either because I was so young. I am 30. I also have a lump on my sternum and few symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer as we'll. So I am very worried that some of these things could be related and I don't want to go to the doctors and tell them all this and they think I'm a loon. Any suggestions would be helpful thank you!!!!! :)
