I wanted to see if anyone else had a problem with this and how they've maybe learned to change or deal with it.  Background on myself.  My father physically, emotionally, and sexually abused me growing up.  None of it was on the "severe" side except possibly the emotional abuse.  He aslo physically and emotionally abused my two younger brothers.  Our household was very controlled and no room for errors.  We were forced to put on a front as a result we all struggle with showing any type of emotion.  We all learned at a very early age it didn't matter whether we lied or told the truth the result was the same...beating, screaming, belittling(sp?).  I am now happily married for 6 years to a man who has completely changed the way I view the world.  He pulled me out of my shell and taught me you can show emotion, in fact, it's necessary to live. He's my protector, confidant, and basically my everything.  There's no telling where I'd be without him.  
 I am in counseling, but, here's what I struggle with.  My whole life seems like it's been one huge lie.  Growing up, faking everything.  This has resulted in me despising any type of lying.  I'm extremely hard and critical on friends. I guess I don't know how to seperate little white lies with the "big" ones.  I lump them all in to one group.  Logically, I know it's not the same as what my father did but, I can't emotionally get over that.  I have very few friends, most of which are guys.  Once my loyalty is given to someone, I expect them to view it the same as me.  I'm extremely loyal, as my dh says "loyal to a fault".  This usually ends up in me being heartbroken b/c I found most people don't have this much passion about loyalty.  
 Counselor has suggested one of our goals be a "reality test"...Does anyone know actually what this means??  Is it just learning to seperate what I grew up in with what is actually considered the "norm" life??
 Sorry, I kind of got to rambling there...
Thanks for any input at all...Be kind.
