HI. Hope i'm at the right place. I have had dizzyness problems for over 2 years now. The problems only seem to get really serious when i standing. I have pressure in my head. Last weak I had a ct and was reffered to a ENT doctor. All the found was a sinus cyst and said that could not be the problem. At night I have a noise in my ears that wont go away until the morning. The first day I had this problem I was really stressed and having a bad day at work. Really getting work up (at the moment) I turned around and just fell to my knees. Since that day it won't go away. Its not a spinning. It's a lighthead, dizzy (I am fixing to collapes feeling). ENT doctor said I passed all test except, He had me face a wall, close my eyes, and march in place and count to 50. I got to 27 and was facing wrong wall and falling (he had to catch me). I asked if it was inner ear and he said he was not sure? I'm sacred, at that monent, when i fell for the first time. That something might have bursted in my brain. I was replaying an argument in my head at the time. I've had to change jobs to a sit down job and i just want my old life back. Do you think it could be the cyst? Thank you very much for you time.
