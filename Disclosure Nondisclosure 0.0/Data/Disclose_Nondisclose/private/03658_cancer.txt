Ok I'm at the end of my rope and pray someone here has had these problems and can shed some light on me.  I've been having very strange discomfort and pain near on my pubic area, hip, and groin. On the right side of my pubic area I have a strange pressure feeling right above my penis, it feels like something is constly pushing and putting pressure on it. Also the right side of my pubic area sticks out further than the left side. I've had it checked and the doctor said it was just the way my body is shaped. Also have a burning sensation in the crease of my right groin, and on my right hip. It doesn't feel deep it's like the skin, but doesn't hurt to touch. Also have had some right side lower back and butt pain that comes and goes.  This is not regular pain just very odd sensations but only on the right side and I have a permant enlarged groin node on that side that's been checked. Said it was small and of no concern. These sensations and pain change through out the day. Like today it's pressure above my penis, yesterday it was my groin and hip with a burning sensation, but it's always happening to one area or another. It's so confusing it's even hard to describe. It's causing me anxiety because doctors can't figure it out, which is kinda understandable, because it's just so odd. This has been going on since December and I've lost 30 pounds and have had night sweats.(doc says anxiety?) I've had tons of blood works, urine test, abdominal CT, saw an oncologist, a surgeon(he said the hump was not a hernia just my body) and I'm set up to see a urologist and orthopedic doctor. I'm nervous they won't figure this out until it gets worse, because the symtoms just don't match anything me or them can find. Summary: Pressure above penis, burning sensation in groin and hip, (all right side) weight loss, anxiety, night sweats, and just feeling unwell. I'm a 27 year old white male, 165 pounds. Any one with any info please help this has been a huge distraction in my life.
