I am 46 years old. I had a hysterectomy at age 25 that left my ovaries in place. I have been experiencing extreme symptoms of what I thought was peri-meno. (Anxiety, frequent PVCs, panic attacks, mood changes, sleep issues,...on and on) My FSH was tested in July and came back 27,  I requested a re-test last week of FSH and  estrogen, LH, progesterone, basically the works, to try to get a better idea of where I was in peri,  the doc said it was useless to do any tests except FSH. I got the results today , it was 4.5 !!  The doctor did not offer any feedback other than it was normal.  This doctor offered me EStradiol immediately when I went for my first visit with her,(before doing any labs) even though she told me it could increase PVCs and could cause me to "throw a clot", and "that would be the end of me".  Not taking the hormones by the way.  I do not understand the extreme variation in the FSH numbers, and cannot seem to get answers from my Primary care doc or the "specialist"
