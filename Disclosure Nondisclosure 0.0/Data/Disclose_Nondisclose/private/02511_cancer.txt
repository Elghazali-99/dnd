I had a subdural hematoma 5 months ago, of which I have recovered to essentially 100%.  
 However, in the week of the surgery, I had 3 CT scans of my head, and then I had one 3 weeks later and then I had one last week (at about 5 months 7 days).  So 5 in total in 5 months and 7 days.  
 I don't know what the exact dose is, but I was told "170" for the one last week.  Is this 170 mSv or 1.7mSv or something entirely different?
 I know radiation is bad for you, and I have been googling some stuff online and reading about how a lot of people are getting cancer from this type of scan, how my chances could go up by 20% per CT scan, etc.  I even looked at and tried one "XrayRisk Calculator" but I don't know the unit to use for measuring... as I said, I was told 170, but the calculator suggests 2.0mSv as the usual brain CT scan.  
 The last 2 CT Scans were perhaps worthless.  I had a bit of a panic attack causing the 4th one, and another causing the 5th one last week (I hit my head on the vehicle and had some nausea, sore head, head aches for a few days and I got upset).   
  My questions are:
1.  Am I at severe increased risk for certain cancers now?  
2.  Am I "panicking" for nothing?
3.  Is there anything I can do to perhaps limit the damage from these and perhaps developing cancer?
 I would appreciate an honest answer if possible.  Thank you very much :)
