I am 17 and 2-5 times a month I can not cope normally. It is impossible. I have a trigger of some sort and I become intensely depressed. Apparently my mom has similar problems, but she doesn't need extra help. I however hate how I feel so alone and alienate from the human race. A few years ago I frequently thought about suicide, and I cut myself because it was a way to get attention from my then-friends and supposedly creates a high and helps troubled teens cope with problems. It didn't work for me. I have not threatened myself since because I discovered that I love living. 
 I still get depressed, and I feel like I'm mentally disturbed. Whatever event was bothering me become the focal point of every feeling I can feel. It's life or death, right or wrong, damnation or salvation. I try hard to keep to myself, when I reach out to anyone, I must sound like a desperate lunatic. I sound to them, that I have a depression disorder. It usually happens in the evening when I am alone, and can last 15minutes to hours and at worse 2 days. I learn to deal with it, and try not to linger in those feelings but I don't think I can go on with it happening so often. 
I don't know if this is a hormonal problem or a mental state of mind. It lasts a half a day usually so I haven't ever actively sought out help. I'm embarrassed by it and still want to convince myself: I'll stop it next time, or it wont happen again. When I feel normal, I feel wonderful. 
Is there anyone that can help me?
