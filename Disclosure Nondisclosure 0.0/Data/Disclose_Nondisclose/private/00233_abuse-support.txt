hi this a male 24 from India,few days ago i have been to a new city,i took a decent hotel,i have been to work during the day,then at night i came back to hotel room and had a couple of beers and passed out,i forgot to lock the door of the room,it was apprantely closed from outside but i did not press the button lock,so if any body tried to come inside it would open,Is it possible that someone the hotel staff or anybody could have come inside drugged me and raped me anally i am straight and this would be my first time,i was lying on stomach,in the morning i could not find any stains on the sheets and my underwear,I woke up about 9 o clock had bath and had stools as normal did not notice any thing strange and went for breakfast,when i came back from breakfast then only i realized i had not locked the door last night,i started searching my anal area for cuts and bruises,over the day i also found slight blood with tissue paper,no bleeding during stools,but their was slight pain,which lasted for couple of days when i had stools their was also slight pain,is it possible that i could have been raped,i am highly worried of HIV.
