In addition (to follow on from last post) I forgot to say that many arguments also occur in the car as partner is obsessed with driving at speed (with family in car car) he is an aggressive driver and though we have comprimised that he doesnt do over 80 on motorway, if ive annoyed him he will then do over 80 in car knowing I have no control and cannot get out if i complain he will often scream at me saying my nagging to slowdown will cause him to have an accident (the shouting frightning the children in back), also during last pregnancy (following some previous miscarraiges) not only would not help in any way (asking me to carry heavy items or doing anything to help with my being in full time work and looking after another child) he critisized me when i took time off work feeling poorly and when I thought I was miscarrying again and was frightened to use our big heavy hoover called me lazy, he flew off the handle breaking our stuff when I asked him for help and throughout prgnancy i felt guilty for putting my feet up and he truly believes that I am the one with mental health problems?!
