I've been with my now fiqnce for 5 years and i have my own child (the father isnt around), and he has two kids with two different women. Both of the moms are complete ******* and manipulative. If it works out for their benefit then its fine, if my fiance needs anything its f you who cares. Thats not the only problem. The biggest problem are the kids. They are complete ******** towards me, my child and my home. They come here every other weekend and think this is their house and can do whatever they want n not listen to rules. I have to enforce the rules because my fiance is a pushover. The daughter is a complete brat and whines about everything. .the food isnt good enough ahe doesnt like this she doesnt like that. .shes a huge annoying baby. The son walks around like he is king tut n disrespectful towards both of us especially me. He thinks he is better than us and does wtf ever he wants. The daughters mom is a snakey *****. She uses social media to try n gather information on me to use against my fiance. Instead of growing a pair n directly asking me, she tries to go behind my back. She tells her daughter she doesnt have to listen to me. The daughter comes here and ignores me, shrugs her shoulders when asked a damn question, stares blankly in daydream land, and refuses to clean up after herself. I love my fiance with everything i have, but i can not stand these disrespectful little ******* children he has. I cant stand the fact that he even had sex with those two ugly ******* n had children with them. When i look at the kids i see their mom n i literally get immediately disgusted. They make me sick. I kno all u are gonna start with the hate n i need help n omg get h er away from those kids...idc. i needed to vent. I fking hate his kids. Hate. Hate with everything inside of me. I wish they werent here at all. Will i ever harm them? **** no. But i wouldnt lose any sleep if they never came back over. Less stress and no more headaches!
