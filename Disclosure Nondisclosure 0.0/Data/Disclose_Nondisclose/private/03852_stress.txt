I had surgery on April 11th. I was given post-operatively four drugs that can cause emotional distubances, psychosis, hallucinations, delusions, etc. Two weeks after surgery, I ended up in the ER with a manic episode. While en route to the hospital, I phoned my doctor to say that I was going to the ER, that I thought my drugs had hurt me, and that I had brought them with me. Upon my arrival, the ER triage nurse was hostile, asked why had I brought all these drugs, and then called me an "angel of death" twice. He then hit an alarm that summoned security. I was put in a guarded room, told to strip, and to hand my clothes out to be searched. After that, a second nurse arrived. I was very upset by how I had been treated and demanded the names of the triage nurse, the head of nursing, and the head of the ER. Incredibly, the nurse told me that my doctor had called to tell the triage nurse that an "angel of death" is coming in. I know that this story sounds fantastic, but I have my sister as a witness. Although I admit that I was altered at the time, this really happened. My problem now is getting past it. It has been nearly six months and I am still feeling angry, devastated, humiliated, and betrayed. I have seen a psychologist, who suggested that I sue this doctor. Why can't I forget this? I think about it all the time, lay awake in bed at night reliving the experience.
