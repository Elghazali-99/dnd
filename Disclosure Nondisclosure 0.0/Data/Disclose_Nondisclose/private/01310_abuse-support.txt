Ive been with my wife for 18 years and it has been a very hard 18 years. I'm not saying i have been an angel or don't have my own faults. I'm just saying that everything i have tried to do to make things better she does everything the opposite of what try to do. Then she will blame me for the things she does to fight with me. If i say i don't want to fight, she will get in my face to get me to fight with her. If i say, lets calm down and talk then , she will keep fighting until she gets what she wants. If i try and talk with her reasonably she wont reason with me. She works her self up so much that she gets the police to show up to are house. In witch she had got me arrested for domestic violence. She had told the police that i had hit her and kept her from making a phone call to the police, and that i was keeping her hostage. In all, I had to pay a lawyer to get me out of jail because I was looking at life in prison. The only reason i'm out of jail today is because my sister happen to have the money to pay for a lawyer, If it had not been for her i would have never got out. The public defender that i had was not even trying to help me. If this was to happen again, I would not have the money to get a lawyer or would anybody else. So every time she gets loud, i'm scared the police will take me in again and i wont get out. She knows this, and that's why she dose what she dose.  I know I could just leave, but I have no where to go. She has the only car we have  and she knows this. so if i was to leave, she knows that i would be out on the streets. So i feel really stuck and i don't know who to turn to.I just would like to know if there is any place i could go to get help that don't cost money or is low cost. They have all these places for women but none for men. Why is that? I really need some help before it is to late. Please some one or anyone who can help or refer me to get me some help, Please do so! You can e-mail me at ***@**** thank you for listening.
