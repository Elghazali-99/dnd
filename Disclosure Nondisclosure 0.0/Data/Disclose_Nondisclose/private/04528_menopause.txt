Has anyone ever heard of such?  I am a very youthful 69 year old who had spotting about the size of a penny the other day. I called my gyn doc and got in to see him the next day.  The day before, the bleeding was so scant and a pale pink.  Nevertheless, the doctor did a vaginal and rectal exam and found no masses.  He found nothing on examing my lower abdomen.  He did a pap, an endo biopsy and checked the walls and of the cervix.  He told me that there were no lesions, and that everything looked good.  He does not suspect that the biopsy would be anything other than benign because of my being on top of my annual exams and paps. I had a transvaginal ultrasound June of 2009 which was negative.  My annual exam with him last year in May 2010 was negative including the pap.  My questions is, how does this appear to you?  Good, bad, not sure?  I am pretty satisfied with his thoughts. He said that he see a lot of post menopausal women with bleeding in similar situations and everythings turns out just fine. I just hope he is right.  I do trust him.  He did say that he thought the cause of the slight spotting was from the estrogen in my body that was producing a mini period. I did have some cramping now that I think of it a while back before the spotting.  Not sure if my breasts were tender. Has anyone heard of this before?  Just curious to know.
