I've been married for 9 months.earlier i was a widow with a daughter & after 2 yrs of my 1st husband's death I got married  to a widower with a daughter 1 & half yrs younger to mine.Now the problem is that my husband is extremely obsessed with his own daughter & is very much partial in his behaviour with the two girls.he would justify that by saying that she's small & therefore needs to be pampered, & with my daughter,he's very strict & harsh.If my daughter makes some mistake, she's being treated very rudely & if the same mistake is done by his daughter he would completely ignore it,giving an excuse of her being small.my daughter is 6 & a half & hers is 5.He's overprotective towards his daughter & this has led  to make her arrogant & disrespectful towards me & my daughter.On the other hand my daughter is gradually losing self confidence & is getting sort of inferiority complex due to my husband's biased behaviour.When I try to discuss the matter with my husband he would blame me for being jealous of their father- daughter relationship & would turn a deaf ear.Moreover no matter how much I do for my step daughter he would say  its still not enough.And I can also sense that he has little trust over me in her daughter's matters.Also he's a MCP & would always treat me inferior to him as I m not earning.I've tried very hard to make this relationship work but all in vain.I'm in a fix whether it would be wise to stay in the relationship & try to work things out or it would be better if I walk our for my daughter's well being?
