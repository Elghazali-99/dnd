Hi,
I am 29 year old guy with some history with depression. In 2002, I got this and i was on medication for nearly 2 years. Later it took great effort for me to come out of it. Through yoga and physical exercise I could leave medicine and its now nearly 10 years that I have not taken any medication. However, i am not sure whether i was all good all these years. I did not have any problem in doing regular work but somewhere I was certainly feeling that something is lacking. During this period i completed my engineering and did 4 years of job. Now, i quit my job to pursue higher education. I came to USA which was a totally different experience for me. I was happy. Surprisingly, i am not doing well in my studies. I am unable to focus my brain and cannot study for long. A kind of subconscious fear persists. Poor memory. I literally failed in every subject which is highly unexpected from a professional who has 4 years of work experience in the similar field. I am very frustrated now. It is taking great effort for me to put into studies. I am really helpless. During 2002 i used to take Fluoxetine tablet and that worked like a magic for me. Do i need to start it? Kindly help. Currently, the major worry is that it takes great effort to study, a kind of sadness, not developing interest in work, sick of other habits that wastes my time. I am looking for urgent help. Hope to get some help soon.
