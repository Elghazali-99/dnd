Okay so my life has been pure hell for the last month or so. I dont think i can explain it all. But i will do my best. Living with my mom was not that great i had a step dad that did not get along and tried to keep me away from my mom and brother. So i moved with my dad. My dad is an alchoholic that lives with his mom and is not employed. He goes from house to house and drags me along with him. Because of this i failed the ninth grade but luckly fo me if i work hard i can still graduate with me class. I moved with my aunt about a month ago and she is great. I feel like i can open up to her and tell her anything. I am finally happy and my dad is trying to take that all away from me. My aunt hd to file for custody of me and my dad is fighting it. Now its a big mess because dyphus is involved and  they do not care to listen to what i have to say. They are trying to force me to go back to his house. School is around the corner and i am so stressed its not even funny. I really wan to stay with my aunt and my mom agrees because she just wants whats best for me but she lives back n georgia so there is only so much she can do because i live in new jersey. My dad and his family are trying to down grade my character and make it seem like im mentally unstable. All for some food stamps and a lousy income tax write off. Courts and dyphus is no help. If i run away again and get caught i will get locked up becuase ive ran away 3 times. Somebody help who can i call what can i do. Im going crazy. I am raged and mad at everyone that has to do with my dad it feels like everyone is against me. Please help me!
