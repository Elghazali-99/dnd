I'm 26 and Ive unfortunately have smoked about 9 years (pack a day to half a pack now, tried quitting MANY times but always fall back into it).  Ive had a sore throat for a few months now. Not like a painful sore throat but more just noticeable.  The back of my throat is red (has been for a long, long time) but usually didnt accompany any swallowing issues.  When I swallow, I can only really feel it happening on the left side.  The right side feels like it doesnt move or that something is there.  Along with that, to the right side of the anterior part of my throat (like pushing against the trachea where lymph nodes are) there is a lump.  It is not tender, just hard and I can move it around a little.  If I press harder on it, it clicks.  In the mornings when I wake up, I'll swallow and have the same clicking noise.  I have experienced right ear pain as well. It just comes and goes every few weeks or so.  I remember this starting a few months ago after I read you could clean your ears out with hydrogen peroxide.  I laid on my side and put it in my ear for 5 min or so and got it out.  I do no not know if that is related, just extra information.  
 I unfortunately also cannot afford insurance. I'm in school full time to become a rad tech and it has only left me one day to work bartending (12 hours) and can maintain my bills and little food as is.  Any advice will be so helpful as I am seeking some clues on how to go about it.  I am trying to quit smoking.  This past summer I tried and was successful for 3 months but fell back into it. I had terrible digestive issues during that process. Thanks for your time.
