My 10 year old daughter is the oldest of 3 kids, my son is 6-1/2 and my youngest daughter is 5, and I'm a single mom. About 3 weeks ago she started her menstrual cycle (starting early runs on my side of the family). Before she started it, everything was ok, it could be dealt with. But, however, in the past 2 weeks she has started throwing these outrageous temper tantrums where she starts kicking the walls, the doors, the closet doors, screaming at the top of her lungs, not listening, getting into my face screaming at me, doing the same with my boyfriend (we live together, just moved into a townhouse at the end of February), all at the top of her lungs, lying. The other night during one of her tantrums she took it upon herself to take every single one of her sisters toys and throw them all over the bedroom, among every single piece of clothing in the closet. I ended up having to call my mom to talk to her and to calm me down, she lives 50 miles away from us so talking on the phone is the best option at that point. After we all calmed down I asked her that when she gets up in the morning since I'd be at work to clean up the bedroom. She said she would, apologized and went to bed. I came home from work and told her that the bedroom wasn't cleaned, she REFUSED to let me get in ANY word at all, just screaming at me that it was clean and that her clothes were put away, yet it is now 3 days later and she has NO CLOTHES AT ALL in her closet. I really do not know what to do. I do have health insurance and printed out a list of Psychiatrists that specialize in Child Psychiatry. It is taking a toll on me, on him, and on our relationship. I am getting to the point that I am losing every bit of patience that I have and am getting so frustrated to the point that I almost can not deal with it.
