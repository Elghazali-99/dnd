Ive been dating my guy for a year and our relationship is amazing!  Hes everything any woman would dream of, but like always there's a bad side.  He has a problem that surfaced 6 months into our life together which is that i have 3 kids by other men.  He knew this before we started anything so I've been confused through all the trying and arguments about how we aren't progressing and many times of us trying to walk away...we love each other...alot!  Well now im pregnant with his child and the problems have worsened he wants me to have an abortion, but he seems excited for a moment as well...i dont know what to do?  I dont want to have an abortion but he makes its vlear that im being selfish because of my decision and that once the baby is here thats all hes worried about theres no love or anything between us...just a kid, but in the same breath says that for my sake he hopes i dont  miscarry because thats the only way hes going to be involved in my life and if i do miscarry i will never see him again!  Im confused hurt lonely but also prepared to handle my responsibilities with or without him...help!
