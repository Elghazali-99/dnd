Tuesday I had normal bowl movements.  I am a three a day kinda girl.  I have been taking one a day vitamins, fiber gummies and that  garcinia crap(trying to lose weight).   Wednesday I woke up with some discomfort and bloating and pain in the lower back - and couldn't go to the bathroom.  Wendesday night I took way too many laxatives.  I was freaking out and just wanted to poop - my dad had pancreatic cancer and it just freaked me out -  so I did get relief - but watery stool turned into yellowish and had Mucous in it - so of course I thought I was dying from constipation , a bowl obstruction and every kinda of cancer.   So I didn't take anything. Have been drinking tons of water and eating as normal - high fiber foods - Been getting indigestion at night and sweaty.   Woke me up twice last night.  This morning I took some mirlax.   No cramping.  Just lower back pain - mostly coming from my SI joint.  And now I do have a normal consistency of stool. It's just really thin.  I guess my question is - does it take a bit for your bowls to kinda get back to normal. Bc too honest.  I'm freaking out about colon cancer now... #worrywart.  Please give me yalls advice and opinions. Oh I am 35 with no known health issues
