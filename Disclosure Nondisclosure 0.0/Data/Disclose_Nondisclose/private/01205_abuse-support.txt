I have reached the limit of what I can take from the mother figure in my life. She has been physically, verbally and emotionally abusive my entire life (nearly 45 years). She guilt trips me and manipulated to the point I said NO MORE. My faith tells me I should "honor thy father and thy mother" and she tells me "your God is disappointed with you." She is a professed atheist.
 This woman has driven me to a suicide attempt at 14. I carved my own wrists. When she found me on the kitchen floor, slumped against the cabinets, bleeding into the denim of my jeans, she kicked my leg, told me I was an *** and returned to the bar on the corner from our home. She has driven me to therapy on two occasions. EXTREMELY helpful I might add - God Bless Brian and his insight.
 Her latest (and last) attempt to get her digs in on me, was to send an interest earnings statement to my daughters (she had put some money away for their college education) and then close the accounts. Our oldest daughter is a senior and we needed account specifics for financial aid statements (anything bearing her social security number), she informed me that "they would not be getting any of it" because of the way I have behaved.
 My question - There's still a nagging part of me that says I should keep trying in the name of faith and family. There IS a father figure, but he oh-so-conveniently has turned the other cheek to this woman's evil my entire life and says/does nothing - EVER. Has anybody ever just shut the door to an abusive parent and went on with their life? How do I get rid of the nagging feeling I should continue to take her abuse for the sake of family and faith?
