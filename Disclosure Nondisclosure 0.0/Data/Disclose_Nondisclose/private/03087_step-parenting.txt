My fiance and I met over 4 years after his marriage ended due to her affairs and it was only after I started dating him that she wanted him back. Over the past 6 years she has tried enlisting the "help" of not only their children but also her daughter whom he treated as his own from 8 years old. I know that she covered for her mother while she was with other men but she told my husband that she didn't know anything before he did. She is in her early thirties with a partner and 3 children and we see them 3 -4 times a year when she wants her presents but she contacts my husband constantly to ask for money. I have tried to be welcoming of her and her family but she has made it very clear that for as long as her mother wants to be back with my fianc√©, she will do anything to achieve this. Unfortunately he refuses to believe she lied to him and is trying to break us up (we have been to a councillor but still no change). I am at the end of my tether and don't know what I can do to change this situation so any advice is welcomed.
