How do you know when enough is enough and seek treatment?? For the past year I feel like my bpd and anxiety are taking over my life. I don't know who I am anymore. My moods bounce so much. I have so much pain and anger inside. My boyfriend of two years has left me because of it and my infatuation, yet hate toward him. My si has become so frequent. If I'm not under the influence I just want to curl up in a ball under my bed. Most of the time I'm numb and desensitized. I'm lashing out at the ones I love. I'm past the crying stage. Now I just don't try to feel. Then at times I'll cry at something as minor as someone singing. Sometimes the world, people, and things in it don't seem real. My anxiety makes me stay in all the time. I feel so trapped. Have no interests in anything. Always so bored. Quit my college classes and can't get the nerve to get a job. How do I make this hell stop?? It don't ever go away. Nightmares plague me. My friends are slowly drifting away from me. No one seems to care or understand what I'm going through. Sometimes I'm way to emotional. The smallest things hurt me so bad. I feel like there's no way out. I have been in therapy and had med management for over ten years. I quit going to my therapist. I'm not whining. Just need advice on how to supress all this mess.
