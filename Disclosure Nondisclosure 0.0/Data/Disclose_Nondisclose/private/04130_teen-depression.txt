This is a long read, so bear with me, please.
 I feel like I should begin by telling a bit about myself.
I'm a 14 year old girl, and a freshman in high school.
I've been experiencing a 4 or 5 year depression as of now, and the stress that comes with it leaves me hopeless at times.
My family life isn't great, I constantly get yelled at, as well as verbally abused, yet I'm expected to be happy with no issues. My school, life isn't much better. I a social outcast, being rather quirky, socially awkward, quiet, and naive, and although it's by choice, it frustrates me to no avail that I don't understand the average teenager. My social life is non-existant outside of the internet; everyone in my area is preoccupied with sex and dating, which, having never experienced an attraction to anyone, is quite annoying.
I was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, ADHD, and OCD around age 8 or 9, and I believe I at least have traits of a Schizotypical Personality Disorder, and/or Paranoia. 
I'm constantly worried about things, particularly my future due to my stress leaving me unable to concentrate. I also constantly worry, and occasionally, though not frequently hear things.
 I've tried to no avail to straighten my life out, but others place incredibly high expectations on me, weighing me down even more. By this point, I've seen 3 therapists, 3 school counselors, and attempted to discuss my situation with teachers and my parents. My mother says that it's my own fault I have problems, and my step dad just tells me “take deep breaths”, or he refuses to believe I've been so troubled for so long. I'm in no way suicidal, as I believe that suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problem, no matter how temporary, as well as the fact my good friend almost succeeded in killing herself. On the other hand, I have self-harmed, but on very rare occasions.
 I'm just so confused now. I don't know myself anymore, and I don't feel like I ever did.
 I apologize for the long read.
