I have a 6 year old little boy.  He doesn't have any major behavior problems. Just the ordinary, thinks he knows everything sometimes and doesn't want to listen something he is told, and just like every other 6 year old he wants to test his limits to the max.
 But I need a few pointers on teaching him how to deal with being angry.  It is so much harder being a kid now a days.  
He gets so angry when other kids stick their tongue out, or if they call him names.  What are some productive solutions on helping him deal with this.  At the moment he wants to punch the other child, even if it is a younger child at daycare.  I have tried to tell him to try and ignore it.  If they call you a name just say yeah okay.  I tried telling him that if he did not let it bother him, they would get bored teasing him because he would not be giving them the reaction they are looking for.  He tells me that he cant, that he just gets so angry that he cant control it.  he sd he just can't help it because he just wants to hit them.
 I don't really know how to respond, I don't want to over react because it is my responsibility to teach him how to deal with this.  Granted he is not getting any extra priveledges, but how can I teach him to control his temper??
