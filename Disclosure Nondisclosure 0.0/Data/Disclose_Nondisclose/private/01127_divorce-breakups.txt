I am married 15 yrs. with 4 sons all under the age of 11 yrs. old. Just last year, my husband left for a week without me saying it was a much needed vacation. But on his return, he changed. He was cold and distant. When I confronted him a month later he said I was unlovable. There are traits about me that he just doesn't want to deal with anymore; he said we were incompatible. I bore this burden for an entire month with burning pain..could not sleep, eat, or much less do anything. Lost lots of weight from size 14 to 6.  But, later I found out that he was secretly communicating with an ex-girlfriend. When I confronted him about this, he states (repeatedly) his refusal to severe this relationship and would rather relinquish our marriage, children and all. His family talked to him, and he remains with us. But, he stays begrudgingly. I have received a bitter pill of love, and my heart refuses to take it. Would you refuse to take it and let him go - be free to fly? or Take it for the sake of the children to have both parents and wait in hope for his love to return?
