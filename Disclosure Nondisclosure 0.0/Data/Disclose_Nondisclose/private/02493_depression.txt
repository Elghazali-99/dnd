For about a while, I have been creating fantasies in my head. Normal daydreaming. But recently, they have been getting more and more complicated and I have been figuring out how to solve daily issues in the universe of my daydreams. I lose focus nearly instantly when thinking about them. The most severe one was a world where I had elemental powers. I had created an entire historical race, names of gods, rules and various other things just for that historical civilisation. Once, my history teacher asked me to get some books from another class, and before I even thought about simply walking over, my mind had gone to shapeshifting into a bird or riding a horse made of water. Majority of the time, I wish I was actually in these worlds and doing these amazing things. This went on solidly for about four months. I still think about it now. It's very distracting from my school work and homework and daily things become a chore, like eating. I don't feel like eating at all.  I will eat, but I will quickly get over it. On snacks, I only eat a packet of crisps or so. My sleeping is already botched because of my insomnia, but I do find myself lying awake thinking of them. 
My friend said I might want to see someone, as she thinks it may be a sign of depression - I have been bullied a lot recently. Or it may just be something else. I just wanted an educated opinion on what it may be, so I have an idea of what I'm getting into if I decide to take it to a doctor. Does anyone have any ideas?
