Hello,
 I see similar questions have been asked before but would appreciate advice on my own experiences.
I'm currently in the process of coming off effexor, which I started taking in April 2012. I have been tapering for a year now (after my doctor initially telling me it would take around 3 months) and am currently down to 18.75mg per day (half a tablet-using venalflaxine so I can cut them in half) from 112.5mg per day. I have only been on 18.75mg per day for the last three weeks but it has gone relatively well with no major symptoms.
Basically I am debating whether or not to go cold turkey or continue trying to taper in the final stages. I have a week off work next week which I could use to quit and just get it over and done with! I then have two weeks where I'm only at work 2 hours per day so if I was still having symptoms it wouldn't be a major problem like it would be normally.
I'd like to know if anyone has tried anything similar or has any advice for me, or what you would do in my position.
Any answers would be appreciated!
