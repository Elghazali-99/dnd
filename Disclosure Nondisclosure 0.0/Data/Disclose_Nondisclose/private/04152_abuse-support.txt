I'm sick of him and I hate him so much that I don't feel comfortable around him or trust him anymore. He abused my mom physiclly a few years ago that it even caused bruises on her face and he kicked her out of the house for a whole night and made her sleep outside the house. I started to hear punching sounds at night and when I went to theiving room I saw my ddad hitting my mom, I shouted at him and he pushed me to the floor. And when I decence my mom he either call me with mean words or hit me. He always and everyday make fun of me and of how I physically look and calls me stupid, retard and idot and makes fun of my talents and what I do and of how failure I'm at school. He makes me feel useless that sometimes I wish he could die. I'm so depressed and I struggle with tons of other stuff at my life, I'm a failure at school and insecure and I have low self esteem and I was bullied at school and my dad didn't even give a crap about me. He embarace me everywhere. And he's so cold with me and my mother basically the whole family. He only cares about himself. I really want to die.
