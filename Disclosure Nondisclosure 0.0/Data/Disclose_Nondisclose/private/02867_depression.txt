Hello, 
I have been taking Effexor XR 225 mg for 8 months and my doctor and I have decided to wean me off of it. I am 5 weeks into this and am down to 150 mg. I feel like I have reached the point of pure insanity, i cant tell what is real anymore but i have to keep telling myself its only withdrawals. it is so tempting to just go back to 225 mg considering I cant keep my life on pause for much longer. I am a sophomore in high school and let me tell you, This drug has been one of my biggest mistakes of my life. I am now flunking out of school due to these withdrawals, Ive been spending most of my time in bed because I refuse to wake up to another day filled with brain shivers, migraines, heat flashes, irritability, and muscle spasms. I constantly feel like i have the god offal flu and I am debating wether or not I should just set myself on fire because my brain is literally dying. I ache, there is no escaping this withdrawal because it is also in my dreams. This drug should be taken off the market. Is there any hope for me and getting off this terrible drug so i can be symptom free and think clearly again like I used to a month ago? Are there any other people experiencing the same thing? 
 thank you, 
 Jackson
