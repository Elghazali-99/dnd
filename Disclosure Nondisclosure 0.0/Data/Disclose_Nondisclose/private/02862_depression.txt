Hi all, bit of background info - 17, 18 in July (though, how I'm feeling I don't want to make it to July), studying A-levels and just having a really bad time. I have a small social circle (which I prefer tbh) but I feel I can only tell my best mate of the group because I don't want to burden or "freak-out" any of my other mates, and she's been through depression and anorexia before, but she's been (physically fortunately!) ill for past week or two, so ain't seen her to talk about how I feel
 I have a car which I was essentially forced to do, but is a pig to run when you've got no money and no-one will give you a job... I only feel OK asking for money off my Nan because it's essentially coming out Camerons crap Govt. pocket...
 Yes, forced is a harsh term, but (aforementioned friends excluded) it's how I feel towards everyone. I live with Mum and her boyfriend (Dad unfortunately died when I was about 10) but she cares little for me, just enough to carry on allowing me to have a roof under my head and 3 meals a day, I'm always put last...
 And all I do is wake up, go to college, drive back, sleep from exhaustion because I hardly sleep from just irritation and downright dispair, and with me back from college around 5pm/6pm, that also doesn't help with the insomnia, and then I relive it all over again - every day I walk past a bridge from car park to college and it's got ever more tempting day by day... 
P.S. Not officially diagnosed with depression, but just look at what I've put - don't think I need a doctor to tell me I'm depressed
