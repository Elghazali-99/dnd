HI I HAVE TURNED 24 LAST WEEK, AND NEED SOME SERIOUS HELP. PLEASE LISTEN MY STORY PATENTLY.
I AM ANGRY AND OFTEN I HAVE A VIOLENT OUTBURST OF ANGER. I CANT CONTROL MYSELF OFTEN IN PUBLIC, I CANNOT ABSOLUTELY TOLERATE CRITICISM AND GET MYSELF INTO ARGUMENT & FIGHT, I AM INTROVERT,INSECURE. I HAVE A DEEP SENSE OF SADNESS & REJECTION, AND FEELING OF HURT,GUILT. I HAVE CONTINUOUSLY DEPRESSIVE TENDENCIES. I GET INTO RELATIONSHIPS EASILY BUT CANT KEEP THEM GOING .I WAS INVOLVED IN 5 MAJOR FIGHTS (BRAWLS) TILL 
TODAY AND IN ONE INSTANCE I ALMOST KNOCKED A GUY OUT OF A RUNNING TRAIN WHILE I WAS DRUNK(I REALIZED MY MISTAKE).ALL THE FIGHTS INVOLVED GUYS TRYING TO  OUTSMART ME OR ME TRYING TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTRACTION IN THE GROUP OR OVER WOMEN .I ALWAYS END UP FIGHTING (PHYSICAL/PSYCHOLOGICALLY )WITH AN OPPONENT MUCH BIGGER AND STRONGER THEN ME EVEN THAT MEANS MY LOSS. I AM BITTER,JEALOUS, CONTROL FREAK, DEPRESSED,INTROVERT, SAD, ADDICTED TO ALCOHOL.
THAT IS ME A 5FT 8 IN ASIAN GUY. NO PLEASE DONT RESENT ME 
I GREW UP IN A SMALL FAMILY IN INDIA. MY MOM IS AN ABSOLUTELY CONTROL FREAK AND OVERBEARING TO THE EXTREME. EVER SINCE I WAS A SMALL KID I REMEMBER.MY MOM USED TO BEAT ME UP ONCE WITH A BLOCK OF WOOD(I WAS 6) ONCE WITH A NYLON ROPE(I WAS 7), ONCE WITH A BUCKET, WOODEN HANDLE AND EVERYTHING ELSE.ONcE MY RIGHT HAND PALM GOT SWELLED UP AFTER BEING HIT WITH A STEEL COOKING PAN, ONCE SHE HIT MY BROTHER WITH A LONG SPOON ON THE BRIDGE OF THE NOSE SO HARD THAT HE BLED PROFUSELY. I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO GO OUT OR PLAY WITH OTHER KIDS. WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER SHE CONTINUOUSLY NAGGED.WHILE I WANTED TO GO OUT WITH FRIENDS, I WAS NOT ALLOWED EVEN TO WATCH TV I WAS NOT GIVEN MONEY OR MOTHERLY LOVE.VERY SAME THING HAPPENED WITH MY BROTHER.HE IS EXTREMELY INTROVERT AND NO SELF CONFIDENCE. I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE A SINGLE DECISION ON MY OWN. I REMEMBER EVERY F*****G  DETAIL AS IF YESTERDAY.MY MOM WAS NOT HAPPY WITH MY DAD. SHE ALWAYS DESIRES MATERIALISTIC THINGS, GOLD, VACATION, GOOD STUFFS(WE ALL DONT WE?) BUT TO THE EXTREME.SHE ALWAYS WANTED A MORE SUCCESSFUL MAN AND DUE TO SOME REASONS SHE COULD NOT MOVE OUT OF THE MARRIAGE NOW ABOUT MY DAD...TRUST ME HE IS AN ABSOLUTE SAINT. HE IS A KINDHEARTED GENTLEMAN WHO ALWAYS DID HIS BEST TO PROVIDE FOR HIS FAMILY. WHEN HE STARTED HIS CAREER HE HAD VERY LITTLE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND VERY LESS SUPPORT FROM HIS FAMILY AND WE WERE VERY POOR AT FIRST. HE HAS A HONORS DEGREE IN BIOLOGY, GOT A JOB BY HIMSELF PAID FOR THE EDUCATION OF HIS 2 KIDS AND BUILT A HOUSE. I HAVE A BUSINESS DEGREE AND MY BROTHER STUDIES MEDICINE. BUT MY MOM WAS/IS NOT HAPPY. SINCE THE DAY I OPENED MY EYES I SAW MY MOM QUARRELING, ABUSING MY FATHER AND THREATENING HIM TO LEAVE. MY FATHER ALWAYS TRIED TO DO HIS BEST TO PLEASE HER(POOR GUY)
EVERY TIME UNWILLINGLY I WAS MADE A PARTY TO THE QUARREL BETWEEN MY DAD AND MOM. MY MOM EVEN HAD TROUBLE WITH HER RELATIVES AND NEIGHBORS.TRUST ME I FEEL LIKE 
BANGING MY HEAD TILL BLOOD COMES OUT. I FEEL SAD FOR MY MOM AND DAD. MY DAD, COULD NOT KEEP HER HAPPY WHILE SHE SPOILT MY DAD'S LIFE. MY DAD IS 60YRS NOW AND MOM 56. THEY STAY UNDER ONE ROOF. BUT DONT LOVE EACH OTHER A BIT. I FEEL AS IF I AM RESPONSIBLE. 
NO I DONT HATE MY MOM, I LOVE HER STILL. I FORGIVE HER. I ALSO LOVE MY DAD VERY MUCH. THEY ARE ALL THE WORLD TO ME. I AM CONSTANTLY WORRIED ABOUT THEM..I DONT LOVE ANYONE IN THIS WORLD EXCEPT MY MOM AND DAD AND MY BROTHER.
OUR SOCIETY THINKS MEN SHOULD BE MACHO TYPE ALAS I WAS NOT ABLE TO SHARE MY PROBLEM WITH ANYONE
BUT I HAVE A BURNING SENSE OF ANGER, TOWARDS  GOD.  WHY US !!! TILL THEN I FIND SOLACE IN THE BOTTLE.
