I am 53 and haven't had a period for at least 3 years. I had taken tamoxifen for 5 years for an abnormal breast biopsy during which time my periods stopped. The biopsy wasn't malignant but something which increased my risk for developing breast cancer. A few days ago I was surprised to discover blood on my panties when I went to the bathroom. It continued for a short time then stopped. The next day nothing. The day after that I felt something in my vagina, like a tampon feeling when it slides out. I felt it and it has an irregular surface but smooth feel to it. i can push it back but it returns to the same position later. I am wondering if this is a uterine prolapse? I also had spotting at bedtime last night but is gone today. Other symptoms which I have has for the past 3 weeks are very low backache which feels like muscular pain, mild and sometimes crampy lower abdominal pain and headaches. My GYN can't see me for a month and I am concerned about the slight risk of this being uterine cancer. I need a professional opinion please. I should mention that my GYN doesn't know about the prolapse symptoms yet. I will be calling today. Thanks!
