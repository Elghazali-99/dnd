Okay so on the 11th July 2009 my best friend tried to take an overdose whilst on the phone to me, she was screaming and crying hysterically, to this day her screams are chilling for me. I remained calm on the phone to her demanding her address to send the police over, upon calling the police, I managed to get her address out of her and they turned up in which seemed a hour. Thankfully they got there in time and was thumping on the door. Still screaming and crying I demanded she opened the door. With the banging from the officers still going on in the background she finally opened the door. I asked to speak to the police officers and told them to keep me informed. 
 Eventually I decided to call back her house phone at 6pm to see if there was any news, the police were speaking to her and she was having her stomach pumped. Shortly after I received a phone call from the police, telling me she'd swallowed 26-32 tablets and if she was left any longer this would be a total different situation (fatal). The next day I saw her Facebook status about her being home so I rang her, spoke to her and told her I'm here and whatever she needs I'll try my best to get. I was angry though, not with her, with the boy who put her in that state. 
 Her dad walked in and asked who she was on the phone to, saying me, I told her to pass the phone to him, he thanked me for taking the action I took and I asked him to keep a close eye on her. To this day not a week goes by that I don't think about her, think about that date and think about how much I hate the person who put her in that situation. I get tears in my eyes because thinking about it is hard, because I hear her screams. 
 We hardly talk these days and I send her the odd message, asking if she's well because I don't like the thought of her trying that again. I've not really told anyone this because I find it hard to speak about it but I needed to get this off my chest. 
 Thanks for listening everyone.
