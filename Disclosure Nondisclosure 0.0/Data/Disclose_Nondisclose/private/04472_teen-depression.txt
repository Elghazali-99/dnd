Okay, well, Lately I've been tired all the time and extremely pissy over nothing at all. I'm always locking myself in the bathroom for hours on end, just sitting there listening to music. I've recently started cutting (I know it's horrible and I haven no clue what made me do in the first place but I felt like I should include that in here) and I can sleep for over 13 hours a day sometimes. I barely get out of bed let alone leave the house and I go form eating non-stop all day to going almost a week barely holding in one meal. Nothing bad happened in my life to cause this and I'm not even sure what it is. I don't think it's depression because even though sometimes I feel absolutely miserable it passes after a couple of days, and I don't have cycles like I (think I would) have if I were bi-polar, it's just on and off randomly. This has been going on for almost a year now and it's gradually getting worse (people are starting to notice somethings wrong now). Oh and I'm thirteen. (So this could possibly just be puberty at it's worst?)
