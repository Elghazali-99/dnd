Hi, i'm normally over on the Anxiety forum and this is the first time i have come across this forum but anger is a big issue for me and i truely believe anger is the reason i have severe anxiety, panic attacks and agoraphobia. I have had a tough life which started while a baby and have extremely deep set issues.  I was on Paxil 20mg for many years and found that all the anxiety went away but i was still left with this explosive and voilent temper.  I never get into blood curdling fights with my immeidate family or my children but mostly strangers or people who i don't have great respect for, i just let rip on them and don't even care.  I am soooo angry with the world that sometimes i wish the whole human race would be wiped out by a virus.  I BELIEVE THE HUMAN RACE IS A VIRUS!!  I am in therapy CBT, have only been covering my issues for the last 6 weeks but i feel this could take years if not a life time to really calm.  
 Has anyone any ideas that they use to help their anger issues? What can i do to further help myself before i end up in prision or a mental hospital for the criminally insane, cause i'm starting to believe i will hurt someone. Although never my kids, i would die before they got hurt.... No people on the street who do not respect nor care.
