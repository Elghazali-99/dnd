My husband has been out of work for 13 months now.  I have been working full-time managing a restaurant.  In January I got a 2nd job to pay for all the credit card debt we had encountered while he has been unemployed.  I worked 80 hours a week for 6 months just to get by.  In June I accepted a full-time job at my 2nd job and left my previous full-time job.  Every time I ask my husband if he is looking for a job or found any new postings his response is, "you make me feel like an f-ing idiot when you ask me all the time if I have found a job.  I am looking and just this week alone have sent out about 35 resumes with no calls back." I say, "you might have to look for a job in a different area even if it is not quite what you would like to be doing."  He just glares at me.  He has been working a consulting job on and off, but it only pays $500/ month.  His truck payment is $622/ month.  I haven't made a payment on his truck in 6 months and of course it is in my name so they call me 2-3 times/day wanting money.  I have to come home from my full-time job and do all the cooking, cleaning, laundry etc.  Oh, and he also expects me to pay for his children's healthcare from my paycheck.  (He has 4 from a previous marriage.)  
In my opinion he should get any job he can, even if it is not making as much money as he was before or not doing something in his field.  His ego gets in the way of that.
What do I do?
