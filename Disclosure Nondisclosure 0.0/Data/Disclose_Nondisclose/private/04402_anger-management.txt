So, I feel angry more than half of the time I'm awake and I hate it. I don't know what to do anymore.
  My family is freaked out because little things set me off. If I see something that I dislike, it makes me immensely upset and I start yelling at whoever I feel is the cause. I'm starting to push all of my friends away because they don't want to have to deal with my attitude. My girlfriend is on the edge of breaking up with me for good because when I get angry, I just act like I don't care and I say or do anything whether or not it hurts her feelings. A few weeks ago, we got into such a horrible fight, I destroyed her room. I broke her stereo, ripped all her posters off of her wall, turned her bed over. It was terrible. And just earlier this week, I got so mad that I broke her brand new iPhone. I make my girlfriend cry and I'm so mad that I don't even react. Sometimes, I laugh when she cries. I'm lost. I don't know how to control my anger. I feel like I've tried everything and nothing's working. I'm tired of acting like I don't care. And I'm beginning to hate myself for what I do to her. Help me!!! I don't know what to do with myself anymore.
