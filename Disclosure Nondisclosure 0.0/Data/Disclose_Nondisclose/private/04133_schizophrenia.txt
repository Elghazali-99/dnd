Hi all,
 I was wondering whether anyone could help me with a diagnosis based on any similar experience. The things that I am experiencing now are causing me major distress on  a fault basis and I just want advice on how best to proceed and get over this to live a normal life. 
 Ok, so at the moment I suffer from thoughts and feeling of doing something terrible to my girlfriend. I have these thoughts and urges to harm her, but I don't know where they come from or why they will not stop. I also have these voices in my head that will just chatter away, not even to me half the time. They will talk in celebrities voices, or in just random voices. This scares me as I then worry that they are trying to tell me something or worry that they will try and tell me to do horrible things. When this isn't going on, I hear songs playing just over and over in my mind. These can be songs I recognise, or in rare cases some that I do not.
 I am obviously concerned that I am slowly losing touch with reality and would appreciate some kind of advice on how to deal with all this/thoughts on what this could actually be and why it is happening. 
 Kind regards everyone and thanks for any help,
 Elliott
