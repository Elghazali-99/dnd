So today, February 27th, is my birthday, a day you would expect to be full of joy and happiness, but all i can seem to do is stay in my bedroom and shed tears at the thought that i may never be as close to my father as i was only a few months ago again. On November 11th police came round to my house, taking me for questionning over something my Dads wife, as i cant bring myself to call her one of my mothers, accused me of raping my sister, the trial is going my way and i did a polygrapgh to prove to my Dad i was telling the truth when i said i never did it or anything like it, but he refuses to look at the results and i havent seen him since september, i have been living with my mum and siblings for months now and the trials still going. I cant get my head straight, I have been getting angry a lot easier and i havent been anywhere near as organised, and as i missed almost a full term of school because of the trial, my rades are slipping, which is only making matters worse. In ri.ary school I was bullied physically 3 years straight, anyone i told never believed me, until i, and 2 of thegroup of bullies were sent to hospital, that is the same type of anger i feel building up now, and i dont know how to rid of it all. I have no phone, no computer, no money as the police still have all my possessions. I ama struggling to cope, what can i do to get out of this slump...
