I'm currently on Zoloft to help deal with social anxiety.  Things are pretty well under control.  I do occassionally have mild panic attacks when under stress.  Last week are had a particularly stressful day at work.  During a meeting with very high emotions, I felt the pressure in my head grow uncomfortably.  My cheeks turned red and blotchy and I started to feel dizzy.  Not a typical headache, just tremendous pressure.
 About 20 minutes after the meeting concluded, I took my blood pressure and it was only slightly elevated.  However, I still felt the same symptoms.  It's now two days later and I have not fully recovered.  I'm still somewhat dizzy and feel tired all the time.  My head and neck are very tight.
 I don't know if this was a one time issue where a spike in BP may have caused a type of panic attack?  Or if I should be concerned about something more serious.  I've been in stressful situations before and never had anything like this happens.  Generally, my panic attacks involve sweating and some difficulty breathing.  This time, my breathing was fine and I didn't sweat at all.
