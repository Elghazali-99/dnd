New meds depakote250 mg 2 times  a day. She didn't want to start me on it yet but I needed to be stable and said I would deal with the wait gain and complain later if I had too. The way I figure it is the zanex make me hungry anyhow so hopefully I wont be any hungrier and I'm tiring to watch my weight. Lamical 25 mg a day moving up weekly one pill to 3 in three weeks to 75 mg. And well go from there. plus she gave me some klonopin also I was a wreak yesterday and it showed. I think I pretty much went through all the other anti anxiety meds there was. After taking zanex though for almost 4 years on pretty much a steady basis at 3 to 4 mg I'm not sure the dose will work though. Thats me self medicating over the years. I haven't told pdoc  and I don't exceed that dose cause its pretty much as high as they will go. But it will come in handy 4 sure I need something for my anxiety. And that dose is from years of use. I didn't start at that dose. So far I feel great. Hope it lasts.. last time it didn't but I'm praying I just want to be stable for me my kids and I want to go back to school and feel I cant being such a wreak all the time.
