recently my girlfriend broke up with me.. these lead to thoughts that it was all my fault.. that i always **** up and I can't do anything right.. the last 2 other relationships ended the same way.. and i think its mostly because i take my anger out on them and drop all my feelings on them at once and they can't take it.. i feel like i need a girl in my life to rely on and keep myself together. nothing else really matters. i have had all these symptoms for years
     I often feel anxious or sad.
    I feel guilty or worthless.
    I am irritable and lose control easily.
    I am less hungry than usual. (except sometimes i eat more than usual)
    I don’t enjoy doing things that used to make me happy.
    I don’t have much energy to get through the day.
    I sleep much more or much less than normal.
    I find it hard to concentrate.
    I have been loud and had emotional outbursts.
    I have been skipping school or other activities.
    I have headaches and body aches.
    I drink alcohol and do drugs to make me feel more “normal.”
    I don’t have much hope for the future.
    I feel like my life will never get better.
    I think about death or hurting myself.
 I hate school more than others and i have ABOSOLUTELY no energy at all! no matter how much sleep i get i wake up exhausted and feel that way for the rest of the day. i've went through a lot of **** that i think has really ****** me up. im not going to go into detail i just need something to fix this. I've tried therapy. it doesn't help and it's stupid, also, it makes me feel like even more of a fuckup that i had to take therapy in the first place. my mom denies that i have bipolar or depression disorders. i hide my true feelings from others to feel normal. i'm scared and i'm tired of being this way.
