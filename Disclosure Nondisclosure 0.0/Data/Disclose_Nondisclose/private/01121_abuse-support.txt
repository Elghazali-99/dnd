My son has become very aggressive the past few months, in the past he had spells of this but now it is bad. I am now going to a help group, as my son is getting violent.  His Dad has only seen him once a month for a few hours for the last 3 years, previously it was every 1 to 2 weeks. He says due to work, but as he's married now I feel his wife is controlling this. I have in the last 2 years let him take my son out, which I am loathe to as I have a Prohibitive steps order in place - when my son was a baby his Dad's family tried to walk off with him 3 times without asking me, and they have a house in India. They were intimidating and against me as I am white.  My son has said in anger he wants to live with him, but then says he doesn't mean it, as his Dad is very flippant and refuses to visit him more than once a month I am getting to the point of wanting to stop him seeing him. It is doing more damage than good, and as my ex was violent to me a few times before I made him leave I don't really think it any loss now. He refuses to help over my son's behaviour, if I ring his house I get abuse from his wife, the family want my life to be difficult. I know it is good for a child to see both parents but this situation is ruining the relationship I have with my son. I feel the same fears I had again when we were together, and know that this is not right.  Can anyone see what I should do for the best.  Thanks.
