My husband noticed that my daughter's new boyfriend is overly friendly with my 3 year old grandson.  Now that he has said that, I notice that the new boyfriend will kiss my grandson on the forehead, and tells him secrets.  
 I saw the two of them in the bedroom the other day.  The boyfriend was sitting with his back to the open door of the room and the grandson was playing with some toys.  The boyfriend kissed my grandson on the head and whispered in his ear. 
 My grandson was pulling at his pants the other day and I asked if he needed to go to the bathroom.  He responded with "I am trying to make it stand up."  I thought this a bit strange, but shook it off as someone his age experimenting with his penis.  Now I'm not so sure if he isn't experiencing some kind of abuse.  My grandson also expressed that his bootie (meaning butt) itched the other day.
 He has recently been potty trained and has had a few accidents in the past.  Now, however, he has started pooping his pants at preschool.  
 After reading all the posts about sexual abuse, I'm concerned - is this normal behavior of a new boyfriend trying to impress my daughter with his love of her son, or is there something else going on?
 Any advice would be most appreciated.
 Concerned grandparents.
