I'm 13 and I'm struggling with depression and anxiety, I'm struggling with school and feel like I'm failing. I'm in all the top classes at my school which makes things even harder becuase most of the time we work at at a senior level. My mom doesn't know about my depression and anxiety and she doesn't know that I'm failing. I have no motivation to do anything and all I want to do is sleep. I began cutting towards the end of last year but have since stopped. It's hard not to cut but I'm trying to overcome it, my mom still thinks I'm her innocent angel that is working well in school and having the time of my life. And I will be receiving my report card in a week or two and I haven't handed in 3 Assesment tasks becuase I have rather forgotten about them or not been able to do them even with help. She is going to be super mad at me. My mom is very loving and caring but I know she won't be happy with my grades and I really want to tell her about my anxiety and depression but I'm scared she will want me to go to therapists and all of that and it will become a bigger thing than it needs to be. I want to overcome my depression and anxiety and fix my school grades and I was just starting to until my best friend that was a guy stopped talking to me becuase other girls were telling him stuff about me and he believed it... That dug a deeper hole for me and I don't want to go down any further. I want to bring myself up. 
 Does anyone have any advice that might help me tell my mom a bit easier? I know I probably didn't make any sense but I feel like I need some advice from people... I don't have any other adults I can really trust unless I go to the school counsellor but I don't know her... Thank you in advance to anyone who replies...
