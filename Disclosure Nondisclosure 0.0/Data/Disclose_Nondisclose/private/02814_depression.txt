Hi, I need to know what to do about the visual and audio hallucinations I have been experiencing. From 7 to around 10 years old, I experienced visual, audio and tactile hallucinations (hearing the piano playing in the middle of the night, feeling bugs crawling all over me, seeing the ceiling falling down, seeing letters all over the walls etc). My mother just thought it was night terrors and didn't do anything about it as they stopped when I was about 10.
 At 16, I have been diagnosed with depression and am currently not on any medication (I am just seeing a counsellor). The problem is, the hallucinations have come back. They are no where near as severe as what they used to be, but I feel they are getting worse. They have been visual, tactile and audio (seeing faces and shadows, seeing patterns on the walls, feeling like someone has touched my face, hearing voices etc). I thought I could handle them as they only last about 5 seconds at a time, and they are worst at night - but they are starting to occur in the day also. I am scared to tell anyone because I don't want them to think I'm crazy and I don't know what they'll say. 
 Has anyone else experienced hallucinations while being diagnosed with depression? I did think it was psychotic depression at first, but I am not delusional and I know my hallucinations are not real so I have ruled that out. Please help me, what should I do? Will they go away on my own or is it okay not to tell anyone as they are not getting in the way of every day life?
