Goodmorning,
 first of all i'm sorry if i don't write correctly in english but it's not my language...
 I need some help with understanding what is going on in my brain.
It's 10 years that i suffer from Anhedonia, depression, anxiety, fatigue, ocd and my old romantic and full of libido self transformed in a "craving for extreme sex situations, porn and fantasies, and i can't feel feelings of love anymore.
 I know all this could have to do with some issue in dopamine pathways, i read it could be low endogenous dopamine levels or decreased sensitivity/number of dopamine receptors.
 But how can I figure out if it's one or the other?
I started taking Bupropion (Wellbutrin XL 150mg) 2 weeks ago, and now i can say it helped with anxiety and mood but my lack of emotions is still there and no libido improving..
 Is taking wellbutrin safe in case i have low receptors instead of low dopamine? will the increase in dopamine due to wellbutrin cause a further decline in receptors in response to the higher amount of dopamine caused by the drug?
 Thanks for reading
