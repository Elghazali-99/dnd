When I was a kid, my first p doc told me that I had issues with anxiety, depression, and some symptoms of OCD. Ever since I was about 9 I've had terrible obsessive thoughts that i can't seem to control. I've been medicated on various things since then. Later a therapist told me I had OCD, and I did some research myself and thought perhaps I had pure o, because I identified with it. My new p doc doesn't think I have OCD though she know I have some OCD symptoms. Today she told me that I may have Borderline Personality Disorder, which was really confusing to me. Although I do have problems with low self worth, feeling like a bad person and I am constantly asking for reassurance, I don't really partake in much risky behavior, and I am definitely not angry or impulsive. I'm so confused. She told me to do some research myself, but all I'm getting is more confused. I seem to have several symptoms of everything, but not enough symptoms to have an actual diagnosis. I know that sometimes diagnosis isn't as important as treatment, but it sure would be nice to know where to start. Any advice would be really appreciated. Thanks.
