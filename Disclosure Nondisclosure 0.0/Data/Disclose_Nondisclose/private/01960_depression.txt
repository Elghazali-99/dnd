hi everyone.I'm 23. I've suffered from anxiety disorder,PD,OCD,depression,agoraphobia for so many years.So here is my story.
I was 16 when i met my boyfriend,it was my first love and my only man in my whole life.We got engaged and i felt fine and safe with him.I had always to deal with my illness in my own. He knew that's something its wrong with me but he never knew that I'm mental sick until i told him that i suffer from anxiety and i need his help,his support,his LOVE   more than anything else.So what did he do?? He dumped me :) oh God i've been with him for 7 years (i mean we never lived together ) and im so down now.Maybe he's tired of me,and I understand him because I could never give him a normal life,born child,be successful because im cursed .
I tried suicide,I'm afraid i'm gonna hurt myself because i hate myself,I want to die,there's no point of living  :'( I have no one to help me .Damn this ill what the hell is wrong with me? What did i do wrong ? I'm LOST :'(
