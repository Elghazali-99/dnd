My boyfriend pushed me down two nights ago with all his strength when I was asking him why he was upset. I'm almost 9 weeks pregnant with his child and I cried the minute I hit the floor. He went to sleep and acted like nothing happened. (This is the second time he's pushed me down while I've been pregnant). Just yesterday I tried to talk to him about all this when he physically abused me. He choked me, pushed me againsy objects in the house leaving me bruised and scratched up. He has always over powered me so the only thing I was able to do was bite him and kick him. My sister came home later that day to find me all covered up and she made me take my clothes off so she could see the cuts and bruises. Her and my stepfather want to press charges against him but im not sure if I should. Because I always loved him. But I don't want my child to be born into an abusive situation and I don't want anymore close calls of having a miscarraige. What would be the best thing for me to do?
