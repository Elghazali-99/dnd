This is my first pregnancy and 19 years old my child father is 36...he is very controlling and demanding
The other day we got in to a really bad fight I broke his razor he got really mad so I gave him a dollar for it and apologize...but he kept going we was arguing all night to the point where I just gave up and layed in the bed with him I layed my head on his chest and went to sleep the next morning he woke up and said I'm going to my mom house I said ok and called my mom to come get me...then all hell broke loose we started arguing again I pushed him and you said Where hand at and try to suffocate me so I kicked him in the face then he go stop hitting me u no I got a temper I said **** u and your temper I was mad he try to suffocate me then he punched me in my head twice kicked me in my butt and said he hope I have a miscarriage he don't want this baby anymore this wasn't our first fight and won't be our last they always happen like this and he always make me feel like it's my fault
