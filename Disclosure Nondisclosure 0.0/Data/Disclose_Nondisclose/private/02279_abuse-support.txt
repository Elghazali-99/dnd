When I was younger (about 10) my family went church. There was this guy there that I instantly hated. Nobody in my family even disliked him. He would constantly try to get me to talk to him. I never would and I always refused to be around him. I didn't even want him to see me. I would tell people I would only talk to him if he apologized. (I honestly don't even know what I wanted him to apologize for.) One day at church he took me away (he didn't take me there but I don't know how else to say it... he led me?) to somewhere away from everyone else and tried talking to me. Asking me why I hated him so much. He tried putting his hands on my shoulders and hugging me, but I wouldn't let him. I left crying. 
 I don't remember seeing him much after that. I'm 18 now and just thinking about him makes me sick. I don't like hugs or being touched my anyone (doesn't matter if it's even a high five). It's because of him. That time that he tried talking to me by myself is kind of foggy in my mind. I don't know if something happened or not. I know he didn't rape me but am I feeling this hate towards him because of something he did that I just can't remember? Why else would I feel such hatred towards him? Why else would I hate being touched?
