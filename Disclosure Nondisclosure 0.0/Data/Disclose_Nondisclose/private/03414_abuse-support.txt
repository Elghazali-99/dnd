I am neighbor to ( but not next door to ) a family who moved into our rural neighborhood abt. a year ago. the way the two properties are situated , we can hear quite a bit of what goes on.  There is 1 child, a girl abt 14 who is home during the summer days with the father who only works 1 or 2 days a week, due to a supposed back injury. The mother works some also. I believe the father is at least verbally abusive to this child. She is rarely seen, and when she is, he is on her to  " get in the House " etc. If we drive by,  she will not look at us directly, but turns her head somewhat in our direction , tipped down so as not to appear to be looking directly at us. Her arm is at her side ( away from the house ) and she only responds to our waves by tipping the hand up at the wrist. We have also heard him go into a screaming rage at something, not within our view.  Also seen him yelling when she was mowing the lawn, could not hear what was said. The one time, i did talk to her, she stated ( out of his hearing ) " I don't like it when my dad get mad."  The family keeps a Pit bull that races out if the chance arises, snarling etc., when you walk by --- I refuse to go into their yard and rarely walk my dog in that direction anymore. 
Since, they are generally not ( only partially ) within our view, I feel there is nothing I can do. I've heard of one too many cases where people who saw and heard more than i have, were ignored when they reported their suspicions to authorities.
      These are not local people but from out of state, so no family here etc..
      What does one do in a case like this ?  If you would take things at face value with the father, he is all smiles and waving when you pass their home but ther is something about him , a bad feeling I got , right from the first time i met him. He has not done or said anything to us to make us think any thing is amiss and has generally been a good neighbor.
      Appreciate comments.
