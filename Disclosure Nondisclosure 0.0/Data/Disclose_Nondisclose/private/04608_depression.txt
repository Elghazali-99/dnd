Hello all,
Long story short, this is me: 5 years ago I was diagnosed with depression and long before that I started having panic attacks. Since maybe 2 years ago I am feeling much better I wasn't having any symptoms, I was enjoying in life, travelling, making new friends, doing excellent work at my job. So this is the story :  I am trying to get off of my drugs, I was taking Paxil 10mg /day and now I'm off of it since 3 weeks ago. Since many doctors told me that 10mg is pretty small dose I decided to try and get rid of it completely without seeing a Dr. I was feeling good and with basically no symptoms until yesterday. Again I felt like life is not worth living, I felt very weak and hard to focus. I didn't have suicidal thoughts. Can I start paxil all over again or should I first see the doctor? I pretty much neglected my mental health since I started feeling better. So I stopped going to Dr and now I regret that as I can feel the consequences. Now all I need is someone to talk to as I won't see my psychologist in at least a week ... 
 I have another question: I got married in January last year and husband and I would like to have a baby, but that doesn't go well with taking any drugs. Are there drugs that would help me with my depression that can be taken during pregnancy? 
 Today I feel good, yesterday was a horror. 
 Thank you.
 Ana
