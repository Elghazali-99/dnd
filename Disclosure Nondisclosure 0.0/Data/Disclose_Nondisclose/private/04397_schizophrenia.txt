Today I been to doctor and he told me u gained weight and little bit high blood pressure. But I am headache of 20% pleasure life. I have such a nonsense life which i cannot explain to doctor. I agree weight gain increase the bp. But there is another pysco shame secret which increase my blood pressure super high after s*x. If I continue s*x without m*sturb*tion my bp goes very dangerous. I feel i almost go faint. So I do m*sturb*tion after sex, then bp comes under control.  Another next pysco shame secret. If i continue M*sturb*tion only I started to get acidity, my fart stinks, acid comes in my mouth, I have to eat again and again, constipation happens. Then again i have to run for S*x. Probably nobody has such a nonsense and boring life. It far better ZERO S*X. Frankly there is 20% entertain, It's very hard to gain 20% entertainment. And that 20% pleasure I don't get all the time. Sometime i get and sometime i don't. First something makes me very emotional, drags me to s*x, At the end very less entertainment. Then I come to home, in seach of emotion, to do mas*t*u*rbation, there is not much pleasure. I am doing this all to live  but how to I explain this dirty things to doctor?  Secret rely on sexual things which is very very painful.
