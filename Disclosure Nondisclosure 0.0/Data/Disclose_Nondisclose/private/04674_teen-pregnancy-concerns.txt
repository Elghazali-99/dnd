Okay so, I got my period on November 5th, and they last around 6-7 days. They never really start on the same day every month, but around the same time (4,5,6,7). Before my period, I always pms really bad, the sore boobs, cramps, everything. I always pms a week before my period. My boyfriend and I are sexually active and I am not on BC but we use condoms and switch out every so often to a new condom. And, he never finishes inside of me, he pulls out right before even with a condom on AND we always check after to see if there's a hole. Sometimes he doesn't even finish and I just give him a ******* and I know you can't get pregnant from that haha. 
Anyways, it is now November 29th and my period should be due next week but I have no pms symptoms. But I also have no pregnancy symptoms, and it's freaking me out because I really don't want to be pregnant. It makes no sense if I was pregnant, because were always careful like I said. Should I get a home pregnancy test, or should I just wait it out? I'm not sure what to do. Could my period just be a little late? Does it sound like I could be pregnant? A little help, advice, or comfort would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
