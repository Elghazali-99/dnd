Hi, i am wondering how many teens are taking any kind of anti-depressant and or mood stablizers??? My daughter is 15 now and has turned our entire family up-side down with her abusive mouth, disrespect, lying, "violent" outbursts, "always" cunning and planning things" at the expense of anyone! She doesnt care one bit who she hurts! I have learned that she has lost a bunch of friends at school because of her being conceited and dating some rich boy that everyone thinks is a looser! It is BAD, really bad! She calls me extremely horrible names, gets in my face when i am on the phone with my mom, she demands and screams and has fits for me to "give her THE PHONE" I dont know what to do! My mom told me she would knock her TEETH out, put her flat out on the ground! Thats how her mom would handle it!! Thats how they did it back in the old days!  Maybe that's part of the problem with teens today! They say they have it SO hard! OMG! Most of them have NO clue how easy they really have it! Why is it that a teen thinks the entire world revolves around just them???
