I'm tired of it. A few years ago, almost a decade - when I was 18 - I was diagnosed with Schizoid Personality Disorder (SPD) - Covert type. My doctor said it would get better because for women-she said, it usually does, but it feels worse; everything feels worse. I feel worse. I don't know what emotions are mine - that is, if they are in fact genuine or is it something that my "eccentric" brain has conjured.
On another note, I'm kind of just "in my head" all the time. For months-length, things will get better, but then they come crashing back down at the blink of an eye and I feel far worse then before and by far more detached. I also tend to talk to myself when I'm alone as if someone else is there, but the thing is, is that I know no one else is there (like I'm not in a deluded fantasy; I know what is going on). I've done this for a while. I mean, I know no one's really there, but it is just because I'm kind of lonely and sometimes these scenarios seem so real and they make me happier, but it's like they fully control my emotions or at least, what I think are emotions (like they can easily make me sad, or angry, just as they do happy). At times, I can't really control it, like I'll just start speaking as if someone is there. Is this alright?
In general, it seems as if things are becoming unreal. I don't even want to leave my house, nevertheless my bedroom. I don't want to teach anymore (I teach in a post-secondary institution so a fellow professor is covering my lectures for now). I don't want to look at numbers anymore (I'm a mathematician). I just don't want to do anything. I can't sleep. When I try numeric patterns pop up and I feel annoyed that no one else is interested but then I don't care. After I feel horrible - or at least I think I do - I don't know anymore. I'm just so sick of this. I don't know what to do. I need advice or something.
