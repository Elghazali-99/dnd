Hi,
I know this is really weird but please listen. There is a celebrity that I consider my idol, but over the course of a year this idol of mine seems kind of mean, like doesn't talk to the fans a lot, or gets into arguments with another celebrity not all the time though, and it's not my idol that starts it. Anyways when I hear the bad stuff it makes me really depressed. I look up to this person a lot because actually my idol was helping me get out of my depression which is incredible! By posting funny videos for the fans and things and kind gestures of charity programs. It just kind of ***** that i hear these things about my idol, or see videos of it. Most of the time I wouldn't even notice my idol was being mean I thought he was being funny actually on interviews, until I looked down at the bottom of the video with comments saying, "Oh (my idols name) seemed kind of mean, but I like it, it shows sassiness!" What do I do lol? I took some posters of the wall in my room or little collectables and put them away, that's how upset I am by my idols actions. Thanks for listening!!!
