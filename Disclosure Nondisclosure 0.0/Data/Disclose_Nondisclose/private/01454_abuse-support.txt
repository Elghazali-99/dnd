I am 17 years old, I've been daiting my boyfriend for four months. He tells me I can't spend time with some people(well anyone). He tells me that in lying all the time when I'm really not. I can't have any guy friends I'm also not allowed to be with my own sister. The reason he doesn't want me to be with my sister was because she smokes pot (but she has stopped) she's my bestfriend and I miss her but I get yelled at and accused that I would do what she does. My mom and my brother are whom I live with and they both smoke cigs and I have horable asthma and he doesn't want me around it but I kinda can't help it because I live here and he yells at me for being around it. Another thing is school he hates that I go to school because all the guys there he thinks I'm going to cheat on him and I never would this kid means the world to me and I tell him that everyday. I always seem to be doing things wrong everyday and he brakes up with me but I cry and he stays. Let me remind you he is adoptid and his birthmother tells me that he is bipoler. He told me he his scared to be abanded again and has no trust. Am I the one in the wrong? I don't leave him because he's my first and he seems that he cares. Am I the one in the wrong?
