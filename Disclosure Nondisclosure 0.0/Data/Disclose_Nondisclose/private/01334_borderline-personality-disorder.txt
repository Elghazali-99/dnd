I am making effort to work with a woman whose issues I am yet to critically define.  She is mid 30's, multiple degrees, and will have completed a doctorate by fall 2012.  She has a difficult time with relationships and with maintaining work. In  all cases, she has a difficult time accepting responsbility.  Either her X'es or the people she works for do not understand her or appreciate her because she is intelligent and attractive.  In cycles, she displays herself on line flaunting her her features and assets.  She adds commentary like all who do not like what she is doing are haters.
 I am convinced that adolescent trauma resulting in unresolved hurt and anger facilitates both her anger and relational issues.  The approach that seems most necessary is a form of intervention.  I also sense it the least likely to yield a successful outcome.  It would support her perception of being antagonized, driving her further inward to act out more producing more relationships that yield negative outcomes.  It is as if she uses her features and assets as a weapon directed at others that in reality turn on herself.
 For the record, I have no personal intimate involvement with the woman I offer this briefing on.  Her father and I are contemporaries born on the same day.  I am very open to ideas.  Thanks for your regard.
