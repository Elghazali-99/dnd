Hi, I'm a 17 year old female. I'm wondering if it's possible for me to be pregnant. I sort of had sex with my boyfriend Thursday June 5, I say sort of because he couldn't get past the head since it was too painful for me (it was my first time) and he immediately pulled out. He said he could feel my hymen but did not break it although I was bleeding a little bit afterward but not much.
Could I become pregnant if:
          -He DID NOT c*m or precum at any point when we were fooling around
          -He DID NOT break my hymen
          -We DID NOT have a condom
          -He was not inside long (it was less than 5 minutes)
 Am I safe from pregnancy even though we didn't have a condom since he did not c*m at any point?
 This happened about 2 days after my period had ended, I will get my next period the end of this month and they last about a week. We are a little worried because I wasn't feeling well yesterday afternoon/night (Fri. June 6) and this morning (Sat. June 6). I always feel sick to my stomach when I get nervous and I have hypoglycemia so that can sometimes cause me to feel sick as well. 
 I talked to a friend about this who said it takes 4-6 weeks to become pregnant. Four weeks from June 5 is July 3, which should be the last few days of my next period. If I have my period the end of this month like I'm supposed to does that mean I'm fine and that I'm not pregnant?
 Someone please help!
