I've been slightly concerned about my anger for the past few years. First of all though, I have a thyroid disorder; I was born without one and have been on medication since I was 2 weeks old. As I reached puberty I had trouble keeping my levels at a 'normal' range, and my doctors and endocrinologists have been changing my doses every six months or so(which *****! I hate when they do that because I'm a wreck for at least 2 months after they change doses!). I used to be one of those ppl who bottle things up and suffer in silence, but after an unfortunate moment in my life I decided that was not the way to be, so I express my anger now. The problem is, I have no tolerance. Things that make me angry make me scary angry. I break things, like my hair brush, and even a table. Lately I've been trying to hurt myself. I've been suicidal but I'm better, but I've been trying to break my fingers, hands, wrists or feet. 
I'm terrified of being put on medication because I have a wild streak and an addictive personality so I have only spoken to my doctor in passing, not really a full conversation. My question for you people is:
 Do you think I need anger management, or do you think that it's the constant changing of my thyroid meds that are causing my moods and anger to be out of control?
