I am 19, I have been on 7 different birth control pills in the past 4 years. I have irregular bleeding on the pill, no matter what one I take or how well I take it. I took femulen for 6 months and had a period every 11-14 days during the entire time, (expect for one month (march) when I didn't take my pill for a week as I left it at home while I visited my dad an hour and a half away. )But since then, yes I had been bad at taking it on time, but the cycle of 11-14 days continue. 
 I stopped taking birth control 5 weeks ago while on my period, and did not have sex 2 weeks prior to that. I had negative pregnancy tests just after stopping the pill because of pregnancy symptoms. 
 Now, calculating my periods is hard, but in theory, based on my "normal cycles", I would have been due on the June 14th, and going by a "regular" 28 day cycle, I should have had my period on the 28th. I had unprotected sex on the june 20th. On the 20th, I experianced spotting which I put down to sex. But it came back on the 22nd and I am still spotting now, a week later, with no signs of it developing into a usual period? I have no pains either, which is weird for me, as my pains are usually so debilitating that I had a laporoscopy checking for endometriosis ealrier in the year. 
 I know it is highly unlikey that I am pregnant, but I just don't know what is going on with my body!? Help!?
