I have had a very difficult year, giving a child up for adoption and losing a best friend to suicide. Lately I have felt very empty. I realized today I haven't really smiled in a while, but more strange is the fact that I haven't cried. I feel very dazed and dull, like I'm walking around in a fog. I go to take the dog out, I put on my shoes and suddenly I'm halfway down the street, not really remembering what I did to get there. It's like I'm asleep. I can't focus or listen or pay attention to my surroundings. I shocked my hand with a broken lighter recently and honestly it was the most  sensation I've felt in a while. Does this mean anything? Is this the symptom of some sort of mental disorder? I have had a history of depression and anxiety since childhood but I have never felt anything like this before. I can't write or sculpt or paint anything with emotion. I don't sleep much, I stay up very late, I think I avoid sleeping because I don't want to wake up tomorrow. I feel tired but not a sleepy tired, just exhaustion from life. I have always handled my depression well, I let myself feel my sadness but this is different, there is not sadness, there isn't anything.
