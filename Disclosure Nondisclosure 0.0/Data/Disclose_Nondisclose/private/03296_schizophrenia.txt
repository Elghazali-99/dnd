When my doctor told me i was schizo affective , i didnt kno what to think, i find it hard,  i just dont understand, i take the meds, i sometimes miss days tho, ..but i finding my self to be more Anti social, my "friends" dont even talk to me unless they want something, nobody gets me, i cant even talk to my doctor, i put on a fake smile for her and everyone, ..its very,easy for me to cry and i keep having all these thoughts racing threw my head, i have alot of anger and hate, its just too much, my body cant decide which one to be happy, sad angee, ..then all the voices appear in my head around me every wear, keep seeing things i dont wanna, ..i just wanna kno why am i like this, why dont i have friends, or anything . My family hardly gets me, i just wanna go one day with out being called dramatic, or crazy or any of that cause its really not my fault, ..i sometimes wish i had a dog or cat cause than ill have a friend, i cant stand being along, ...it frightens me i dont kno wat to do
