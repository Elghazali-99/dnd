Hi, I need help to save myself.  I have chronic depression since I was 15. Many people suggested me to try medication at that time but, I managed without doing a medication for almost 4 years. But after that situation got worse and I was compelled to try medication and I had it for 3 years. It helped me in many ways like I was sleeping well, was not being down for silly reasons etc, but it was like I had no emotions. So I stopped the medication and it's going to be 6 months from I stopped doing medication. For the past two months I am really feeling sad, can't sleep well and always being really upset even for silly reasons and sometimes without any reason. Looking at my life there is no reason for me to worry like this. I have chronic insomnia that I could go days without sleep and sometimes I used to sit at the same place even for hours whether it is day time or night. I hate to socialize with people , but sometimes I feel like I am normal and I can do all those things. I have never thought of consulting a doctor , but my mom is really worried about me. Today I am feeling normal myself and that's why I am thinking to get some advises from experts. Can a recovery centre can help me? My mom is compelling me to get serviced by CBT Associates ( http://www.cbtassociates.com/ ), but I don't know whether this can help me or not? Will medical prescription work for me? Or should I try medication again? I am really hopeless.
