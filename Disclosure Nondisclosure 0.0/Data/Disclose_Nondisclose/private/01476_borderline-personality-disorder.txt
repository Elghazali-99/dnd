I am 18 years old and I have been a depressed kid since 13, I was an introvert and like to study a lot. But I am a very sensitive person and can't cope with even a tiny joke or a fairly innocent comment. I used to cut myself but I have stopped after considering it to be foolish, I used to break things and beat people up until recently I grew more calm and even when i am angry I speak in low voice always giving people chance to finish their opinions and take it lightly. I am writer, but a strange one. My friends say that I am both over excited and over depressed sometime, they also say that I am crazy. I still feel very depressed about almost everything but don't complain about it so often. But not expressing about depression is making me more and more injured now. 
 I smoke sometimes and I am need of a very full sexual experience which is making me even more depressed but I can't enjoy it my BF for some reason. I am addicted to horror movies and books. I love reading fine literature also. Sometimes I cry a lot in my room and feel worse because i can't cry out loud. There are a 100 more problems going on inside me which I can't describe right now. I am scared to consult a doctor because I don't want medicines, I want someone to listen. My family consists of many many mental patients, My mother had been a paranoid and my brother is Autistic, 2 of my uncles are schizophrenic, one of my brothers are Bipolar, although I don't know if there had been a suicide, sometimes I feel I will be the one to finish that job. DO I have BPD?
