hello my name is Kayla, I am 19 years old and I have been feeling depressed since I was about 9 years old. I did not know it was depression until about two years ago. Even when I was younger and thought of suicide I didnt realize it was depression I just figiured there was something wrong with me like im crazy and not normal. Last year I tried to end my life and was rushed to the hospital they almost could not save me. That was the first time my parents realized that something was really wrong. (I can't talk to them about much they don't understand it as they have told me) I started on antidepressants the day I woke up in the hospital. When people from school found out I was basicly a "freak" and alot of old friends would no longer talk to me. I do not have alot of people to talk to about it other then my dr that I see once a week and my councler who helps me alot. Im just wondering if anyone else really feels this way? My parents say depression doesnt exsist and its all in my head... I really do not know how to deal with it. My dogs are the only things keeping me going at this moment. I dropped out of school in grade 9 because I was soo self concious and always hated everyday of life I didnt want to exsist anymore. Is there really something "wrong" with me? Am I "crazy and not normal"? Or are there other people out there that are dealing with this?
