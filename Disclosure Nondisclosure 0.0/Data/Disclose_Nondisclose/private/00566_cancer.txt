I just was wondering why my Giant celled Tumor keeps coming back? Its on my ring finger between the knuckles. The first time I had it taken out I was 19. It took about 12 days before it healed, but it cam back 6 months later, again had it taken out. But again 6 months later it came back so for the third time I had it taken out. things were looking good until 15 months later it has come back I am having it taken out next week, but will it last? 
 The first one that I had never hurt was just in the way! I am finding that the more that they come back the more painful they are. Why? 
 Also when I was 8 years old I hit a brick wall with my bike and ripped my ring finger (same one with the giant cell) almost to nothing the bone was the only thing really left. amazingly it grew back nail in all. Would this have something to do with the giant celled coming back or the giant cell at all? 
 Just really wondering if I am going to need to have this thing taken out every 6 months or will it stop soon? There is hardly anything left of my finger as it is!
