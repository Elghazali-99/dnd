Please no negative or hurtful comments. I'm already stuggling with enough guilt, regret, shame, depression, worry, fear and anxiety with this issue.
I'm currently 18 years old and female. When I was younger, 7 years old, I was involved with a genital touching game with my 2 year old cousin (also female). I know 5 years is a big age gap which is adding tremndously to my guilt but I can assure that whoever is reading this and willing to not judge me harshly for my actions as a child that I didn't use the age gap to an advantage.. There was never any force, violence, threats, bribes or anything of the sort. This genital touching game went on for a few weeks maybe, I can't remember. I think it was purley just because it was something that we discovered felt good, and I didn't know it was wrong, how could, I was only 7 and had no knowledge of anything sexual or that it was sexual. My cousin has never been scared of me or not wanted to be around me. I just don't know what to do, my cousin is now 13 and seems perfectly fine, we've always had a good relationship growing up and still remain pretty close now. But I'm terrified that I've damaged her and ruined her life, I'm scared of what the future will hold for my cousin and myself, I can't live with myself and I just don't know what to do.
