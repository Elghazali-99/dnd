I know a lot of people hate, or don't like their job much.
 The problem is something in me dissolves into just straight up seeming to not be able to make myself focus on even doing the basic tasks.
 This has prompted me to change jobs and even careers, from law practice, back into legal sales.
 anxiety (fear and worry about the future, making mistakes, imperfection, failure) and depression (regret about past results of the same, seem to be at the root.
 I don't know what to do to change.  
 I've tried A LOT of medication, therapy, mindfulness, CBT.
(I'm going to try hypnotherapy to hopefully help change some of the underlying thought patterns.)
 When I change jobs, I have temporary recoveries where I perform well,  but they are getting shorter and shorter.
 I'm working myself and about to start with a career consultant to try to determine something I think I'd like doing better, wouldn't find completely boring and virtually meaningless, and would be able to stay engaged with better.  I've taken personality tests, read books, and considered a lot of different things.
 I always liked school and did well at it both in college and law school.  Teaching seems on obvious choice, and I am pursuing, but it is extremely slow, difficult and of course ('cause of how I perceive through depression), an awfully big long shot.
 This feeling of failure and hopelessness is the reason I have felt like I wanted to die for the past 5-6 years.  
 I am reading Self Compassion right now and have done various things to try to change this self talk, but it is a massive challenge.
 Any thoughts, advice, encouragement, ideas, etc. are appreciated.
Thanks
