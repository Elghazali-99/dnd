My daughter has been showing odd behavour like she has lost interest with most things she enjoyed, she'll feel murderous and hold knives, and won't say anything she'll just look at you with no expression.
 When we're watching horrors and people die in a gory way her expressions are flat. She often likes to isolate herself and draw violent pictures. She often wants to see blood & someone dead on the floor, she can be quite evil/sinister towards little kids n' adults. She belives that she is a minor that can speak to jesus/god and is his daughter.
 She randomly laughs out of no where, she often feels things crawling her skin. She laughs at inopropriate matters. She makes only little conversations, she is very paranoid and feels like cell phones are reading her thoughts and doing things to her brain.
 she'll go out at anytime and carry knives she even cut a cops wrist with a knife she likes to start fires huge ones, & she has scars on her arm. 
 I need a GOOD straight forward awnser. (please)
