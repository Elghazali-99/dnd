I really need help for my Cousin's son. He is 10 years old and a very intelligent kid but at times he behaves very different ways. Usually he behaves normally but at times he grew violent and forcefully tried to fulfill his wishes. He just purchased play station2 but after 3-4 days he's demanding for play station 3 and when his mother try to convince him, he started beating his grand father very badly. This was just the beginning, after this incidence lots of times he started beating his grand father for his irrelevant demands. Now it has become his nature that whatever he wished to buy we have to purchase otherwise he'll beat his grand father. His grand father also don't said anything to him because he loved him a lot and it is not possible to stop that kid when he's angry bcoz at that moment he looks compltly different, it looks like he's not he at that moment. I mean when I saw him in that mood I was scared compltly.His demands are increasing day by day and it is not possible to purchase each and every toy which he likes that's why my few days back my cousin opposes his demands so he just went to kitchen and takes match box in his hands and threaten them that if they don't purchase a new toy then he'll burn himself.
