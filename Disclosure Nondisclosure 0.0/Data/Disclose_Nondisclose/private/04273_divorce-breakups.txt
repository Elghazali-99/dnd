My husband left our family one month ago after 34 years of marraige.  His father passed away in late July, we celebrated our 34th anniversary in early August, he turned 55 in mid August.  The next day there was a knock at my door and I was served with divorce papers!  I am devistated!  This has completely destroyed our children.  To lose their grandfather and with two weeks time, have their father move out and end the only "family life" they have ever known.  I am trying to be the strong one to help my children get through their grief, but when I am home alone, I completely fall apart.  Our children refuse to have anything to do with their father and they are refusing to allow him anywhwere near our grandchildren.  They are calling him selfish and dysfunctional.  The day after the papers were delivered he moved out and into his deceased father's house.  He immediately began openly dating this 'skank' with absoluelty no regards to our children.  I know that this is a mid life crisis thing, but he refuses to get help.  He tells me that he still loves me but his feelings for this other woman are stronger.  He says that it is too early to tell if he is making the biggest mistake of his life or not.  My couselor told me that he is living in the past (he dated her in high school, over 35 years ago) and that one day he will take off his rose colored glasses and see what he has done.  I don't know!! Comments please!
