Hello all who are listening. I was just diagnosed with BPD. It actually answers a lot of questions for me and others in my family tree. My wife just seperated from me 6 weeks ago, 9 months after giving birth to my only child. I truthfully didn't see it coming. The only answers I could get from her was that i didn't handle things right. I had mood swings a lot, bouts of depression ocassionally. I would get interested in personal hobbies and drop them like nothing a week later. Once I got something in my head it would consume me, but then.. pass away as fast as it came. I had times where I was paranoid as hell about fictional things, anxiety attacks, worthlessness. Failed suicide attempts or thoughts, cutting y arms up and so on. I love my wife so much and just want a normal life for me, her and my poor baby boy. I am trying everything in my power to fix this situation. I found a counselor that supposedly is a specialist on BPD but he strikes me more as a money grubbing moron. He found out I cut myself ocassionally so labeled me a BPD just from that at first. Is it true that only BPD's cut themselves?? Anyways, I am tryiong to find more info on the subject of BPD and if there is groups I could attend that don't cost $135 per session like this couselor. I have a psychiatrist appt. on thursday to find out about meds. I have NO health insurance as I work as a sub-contractor and the insurance companies won't give me ins. due to "pre-existing" conditions. I am new to this board and am looking to find fellow people with this disorder. I do not agree with a lot of peoples methods to thos loved ones that have a BPD in their life to just leave them behind. We are sick and need help, it's as simple as that.. well, not simple but we need help just like anyone else.
