I live in Beijing China and I have nobody to talk to about my depression.  I am usually running into bad situations and whenever somebody helps me, I feel like a burden to them.  I am an English teacher at a training school and teach kids 1 on 1.  They're Chinese children and extremely spoiled by their parents.  I live here by myself and have no family.  I have a girlfriend, but I don't want to make her worried.  I'm trying to find a new job in 3 months preferably in a new country such as Australia or back in the States.  I am under a lot of pressure here and I never have anyone to talk to about how I feel.  Can someone please talk to me?  l hardly eat anymore, because I can't afford it.  The salary is so low here and it's hard to save money in the big city.  If someone else is going through this, let me know.  I am a kind guy, but feel myself getting walked all over in this country.  I am tired and when I am really depressed I don't know what to do.  The air is bad because of the pollution.  So, I can't exercise.  Does anyone know anything I can do to help me feel better??  Thanks, and God Bless.
