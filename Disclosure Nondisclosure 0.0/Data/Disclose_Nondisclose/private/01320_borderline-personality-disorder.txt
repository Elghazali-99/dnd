I have a 15 year old and her behaviour seen by others is abnormal including myself. She doesn't hear voices but she screams ''leave me alone shut up go away'' as so as she does hear voices but she doesn't. She will laugh randomly and she said she feels controlled by something so she burns objects sometimes people with lighters. She said her thoughts are running like trains. She thinks people can read her mind and that people are constantly watching her every move. She thinks food is sometimes poisoned, and the government is stealinf from her sometimes. She seems flat or emotionless sometimes and she will have awkward thinking and she likes hiding away most of the time. She self harms alot and has thoughts of killing everyone but I repeat she doesn't hear voices or see things. She will randomly cry sometimes and she will havw strong urges to hurt anyone even a baby. And she touches something she will think she has AIDs Would somebody give me an answer or a posibilty of what it might be?
