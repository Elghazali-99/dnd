Hi there, I'm hoping to get some help here cause I'm kinda worried. My boyfriend and I have been sexually active for several months, a couple times a week without protection. Last month I had a suspicion that I might be pregnant, so I took two tests, both of which were negative, turned out it was just my period. Then we did it two weeks ago right after my period, and since then I've been experiencing a lot of symptoms. I've had light spotting for about 4 days, I gained about 3 pounds in two days, and I haven't even been eating much lately. My nipples have gotten a bit darker, although my breasts don't hurt. I've had abnormal lower abdominal cramps since I started spotting, and I've been bloated for the last two days. My lower back has also been sore, and I've been peeing way more often than normal. There's no way the spotting was my period, and the cramps wouldn't have been related to that either. I took two more tests two days ago, and they were both negative, but the symptoms are persisting. So I'm kinda confused, and a little freaked out, as is my boyfriend. I'm totally at a loss for what could be wrong, so I would really appreciate some legit answers. Thanks!
