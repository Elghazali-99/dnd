Hello...I am 37 yrs old. I have been dealing w/ this issue for almost 2 years. I am experiencing vaginal rawness and pain after sex. I have been to so many GYN's and no one can give me any guidance or answers as to what is wrong with me. After I have sex with my husband, I experience burning and irritation the next morning/day. I have had STD test ran on me, blood work done to check for diabetes and they all came back fine. A few days ago, after my husband and I had sex, I was okay. The next morning I woke up with slight irritation/burning. We use lubricants since I've been dealing w/ this but it seems to be not enough. I called my GYN to schedule an apt but I have to wait until mid Feb because they are booked. She has treated me w/ estrogen cream. It burns and makes it worse when I use it. Not to mention, it is very expensive. I've gotten to where I don't even have sex that often because of the pain. I really hate that and feel bad that I cannot please my husband. As sad as it sounds, I actually look forward to my periods because I know it's a good reason to not have sex. He is understanding but I have needs too but the thought of sex makes me cringe due to the pain. I was doing some research and saw that some women were using Vitamin E suppositories? Has anyone else tried them? If so, did it work? I'm desperate and will try anything. I ordered some today and I am waiting for them to arrive. It is starting to affect my thinking and everyday life because it's all I think about, the pain, the irritation, will my husband get sick of dealing w/ this and find someone who can satisfy his needs? I don't know what else to do...any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
