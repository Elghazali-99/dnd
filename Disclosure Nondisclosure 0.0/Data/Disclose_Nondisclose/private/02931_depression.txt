Is there any hope for me?  I don't feel like it most days.  I have anxiety and major depressive disorder for several years and am on Fluoxetine and Clonazepam.  I still get so down and depressed that I don't want to do anything including getting out of bed.  I go into a sort of zombie state.  It makes me feel terrible and I often feel worthless, like I am a failure, thoughts of suicide, like I can't do anything right, impending doom, hopeless and like I am losing my mind.  I want to just scream sometimes but know it wont help.  I want to cry and do cry easily.  I was hospitalized once and did better for a while but just don't want to do it anymore.  I have trouble holding conversations sometimes cause my mind wonders and all I hear is my own voice speaking to me in my head, sometimes for hours, or all day long, and it keeps me awake at night.  I feel like nobody really understands and like people get mad cause they don't understand and think I should be able to just go on like nothing is wrong with me and act like they don't think I need any medicine to make me better.  I have been to talk to therapists before but only found one I felt comfortable with and then he took a different job someplace else and I haven't seen a therapist since.  I don't have a job right now cause I got fired from my last one so I don't even have any money to be able to see anyone anymore.  Sometimes I feel like I have more wrong with me than just anxiety and depression but I don't know what it is.  Please help me.  I feel so lost and alone.
