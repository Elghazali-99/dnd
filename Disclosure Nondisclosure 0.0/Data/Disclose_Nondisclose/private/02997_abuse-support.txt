We work together with this guy and I wanted to date him, but he didn't seem to show any interest in his female coworkers, so I'm just his friend. I could understand why he acted that way, he didn't split with his wife, she died. Recently I started noticing something inappropriate between him and his teenage daughter or maybe I am just paranoid. He is 37 and is single for more than four years, which is so weird, because women actually fall for him. And then there is his 16 year old daughter. He has her picture on his desk. They don't look alike at all, so it makes me think she resembles her mother a lot. He speaks to us about his"beautiful daughter". The girl is indeed beautiful, but she behaves provocatively and in my opinion she's a little bit slutty and flirty as for her age. They seem very close and he is very protective of her. She often comes to the office after school to see him and he makes his best to spend with her as much time as possible, then they leave together. They are hugging each other all the time and giggle like two teenagers who are in love. Two days ago he asked me for a dinner at his place, so there were three of us. And I mistook his bedroom for a bathroom, I opened the door for just a second and I saw her dress on a chair. Her clothes was in HIS room. I am confused. I'm growing more and more suspicious. I'm not sure if that's true, and even if that is I'm not sure if I should report him, because I'm confident she started it all.
