I was diagnosed with Chronic Depression Disorder back in the beginning of May after a visit to the psych hospital.
 Since then, I have been on 20mg of Fluoxetine (Prozac) 1x daily. 
 I've had ups and downs since taking it. Some days I feel great, others I feel ok, some days I think I am borderline manic, and - as of recent - I have been feeling down.
 I had a minor panic attack last week for no apparent reason. I woke up about 2 am, and just had an attack. I settled down after a bit and haven't had one since.
 But, as mentioned, I have started feeling depressed again. I did have a few drinks earlier last week, but don't think that attributed to it, and it would have wore off by now if it was the alcohol I am sure.
 This past Saturday I felt REALLY depressed and almost angry.
 I am going through some things at the moment as well (getting ready to get a divorce, needing to find a new job, etc.), so that may be attributing to it as well.
 On a side note, I have been on Prednisone since last Wednesday for a pinched nerve, so I don't know if the corticosteroids may be playing a role as well.
 Is it possible that I am bipolar or borderline bipolar? I've looked up the symptoms and don't really match a lot of them.
 Also, should I consider talking to my doctor about increasing my meds or wait until I am done with the Prednisone and see if things level out?
 Hate feeling depressed again... :(
