So...I was recently working out of town and had a dinner out with some clients.  At some point during the evening I was drugged and later the next day realized I had been raped.  I showed up at the ER on Friday afternoon and asked if there was a test they could do to tell me if I had sexual intercourse in the last 24 hours (I had been out of town for several days so any sex would be a surprise to me.)  I was devastated to hear that they found semen in my vagina and have launched a full investigation.  The detectives have pulled all the serveillence footage from the hotel, interviewed witnesses, etc.  But, because I was drugged I have absolutely NO memory of the event.  It is not looking good for making a conviction and things are so hard here at home.  My husband has been amazingly supportive and we have family taking care of our 2 children right now while we sort things out.  Since I was out of town at the time my rape advocate had very little info about local rape support groups, etc.  Anyone who can give me info or advice or support is greatly appreciated.   I am hearing from every doctor that I talk to that this happens so often and no one ever speaks of it.  I am ready to SPEAK!!!
