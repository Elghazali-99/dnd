So I've been school friends with a girl for about 3 years. I say school friends because I would never invite her to my house, don't ask me why because I don't know. Anyways I've always been shy and really wanted to become closer with her. Well this year was my chance, with us having classes together and in the same areas, as well as lunch. She walked with me and talked with me and has been nothing but nice. She helps me in class when I gave nothing in return. Well about a month ago, everything she did started to annoy me deeply. Quirky things she did that I thought were cute now infuriate me. Even hearing her breathe gets my blood boiling. I haven't been secretive about my hatred either. I've told her to stop following me and I just ignore her and try to stay as far away as possible. This happened a year before to another friend, but now after having some time away I want to rebuild our relationship. I'm just afraid this will happen with everyone I grow close to. I have two good friends, but I think that's because I've known them since I was little. I've never made a friend to keep in my teen years
