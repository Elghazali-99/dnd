Hello. My husband recently has become ill. He had a CT scan at an er and the doctor told him he had cancer. I don't know how they can determine that without further testing. Anyway, he had spots on his colon, rectum and liver. He saw a gastroenterologist who set up a colonoscopy. Benign polyps were removed. The mass on the rectum was  actually very large hemorrhoids. One side has been treated. They did a liver biopsy but were unable to get an actual piece of the liver due to having ascites. They instead took a piece of the perideum (I think) and drained 5 liters of fluid. Those tests came back negative for cancer cells. He went back and had another biopsy two weeks later and they were able to get a piece of the liver and also drained another 4.5 liters of fluid. They said he has lesions on the liver. Tests results haven't come in yet. They have done a ton of labs on him and one in particular, an AFP tumor marker. He has a patient portal to check results so a result showed up as Component	Standard Range	Your Value
AFP SERUM TUMOR MARKER	<6.0	2.4. Does anyone know what this means? He is frustrated because he feels so miserable and we don't have all the answers as to what is causing this to happen. Any and all input is greatly appreciated
