I've been with my husband for six years, and married for only five months.  The course of our relationship has been a roller coaster ride.  I used to think he might be bipolar, but I think his shifts in mood are too frequent and short to be bipolar.  His moods go from one extreme to the next, and never seem to be completely stable in one mood state.  Some of the things that make me think he has BPD are: extreme mood swings, so in love one minute and ready to end the relationship the next minute, everything is about him and how I'm not doing things to make him happy, there is very little consideration of my feelings, he has tantrums when he doesn't get his way, he has cursed me, stated he hates me, and ended our relationship on many occassions, but he has always come back. He seems to be hypersexual, he also has what I believe is a substance abuse issue.  He never seems to take responsibility for his actions.  
 Does this seem like BPD, if so does it get better?  I would appreciate any input.
