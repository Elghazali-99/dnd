I had counselling today,I thought I'd dealt with most things that would upset me, apparently not.I don't blame myself for the abuse anymore,I don't feel guilty and I'm moving on with my life.Today in counselling I realised I still don't have control,he is still there in my head,as far triggers, I still have a few,smells are the worst,people with moustaches,even some books,so now with my counsellor we are working on visualisation techniques to take the control back and put him out of my head and thoughts.I got upset today for the first time in ages.There's got to be a light at the end of this tunnel.And yes allmymarbles if you read this counselling can bring back memories and triggers I personally prefer to keep working with professionals who know what their doing,because although today was hard it was another weight lifted,I know eventually I'll be fine with everything It's just working through it,and no I'm not on here for sympathy or pity.I'm here to share with others that It's not always easy going through counselling.You have to put the effort in.
