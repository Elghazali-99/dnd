I'm 21 years old and in the last 5years I've dealt with more then anyone should ever have too .
5years ago at 17 I was raped and it was my 1st time ever having sex . I thought it was the hardest thing I ever went threw till I spoke up about what happened . 
When I told my mom she was so caring and understanding but my dad on the other hand was a drunk and knew that if I went to the police it would effect his friendship with one of his drinking buddy's so pretty much he picked his friend over me . I was so young and started to hate him . Even when he needed me most ( during the last days, he had stage 4 lung cancer ) I couldn't be there for him because he wasn't there for me .he passed away when I was 18 years old . After he died the guilt got to me for me turning my back on him . Then two years later when I was 20 I got this infection that no one has answers for , the closest thing it sounded like was herpes two negative test but I still google everyday because my symptoms haven't gone away . I just feel so broken and crazy , I don't know how to deal with the pain anymore once a girl who smile 24/7 now I'm a crazy mess where the little things make me break down and cry .
