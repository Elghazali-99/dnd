Hello,
 How are you ? I hope this finds you well. My name is Shelley and I am a mom and have a  19 year old son. I'll first tell you what he was on for the last year.  Adderall XR 25 milligrams , dextrostat 10 milligrams for afternoon, and effexor (75)for mild depression, mind you.  ( I think the adderall was causing the havoc made him tired all the time and rollercoaster mood swings. ) So, got recruited to college for golf but couldn't function for 18 holes. Taking leave of absence this semester to get well. Doctor put hiim on prozac because easier withdrawal symptoms. Been on it 3 weeks and than asked to get off it (I still think it's the adderall causing problems) We asked her to wean him off . She just took him off completely. Now that you know a little of the med background do you think that is ok just to take him off cold turkey? He had been off the adderall for 5 days befire coming home and looked great....he was warm and laughed alot although still had hard time getting going but just seemed happier and healthier. The doctor wanted to keep him on adderall XR at a higher dose , 30 ml. and a short acting adderall at noon also 30mg. Since back on adderall ...very motivated at times but moody , not  sleeping , and so many mood swings and side effects. It makes him very tired at times and lay in bed all day. Could some of what he is dealing with be a side effects from coming off the prozac? How do you know what is what? Since back on adderall he's a rollercoaster of side effects.
 OK..what is my point.....I would like him to go off all the meds for a while to see....(mothers intuition).he can always go back on or try something else....but how will he ever know how he'll you'll do if he  never goes off the drugs. Please let me know how I can help get him get off these meds with the least side effects.
 Thank you for your help.
 A Desperate mom
