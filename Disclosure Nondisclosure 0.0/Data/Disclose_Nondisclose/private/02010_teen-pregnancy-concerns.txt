My girlfriend and I are terrified that we may have accidentally gotten pregnant.  Her family is very traditional and as a result we do not have vaginal sex at all until we are married.  Over the 4 years we have dated we have performed other acts occasionally and several times (including a few weeks ago) we had anal sex.  Due to us not ever having 'normal' intercourse we did not have any contraceptives to use so we thought we were playing it very safe by doing anal and also by not even ejaculating inside. 
 That being said, she is now 5 days late on her period and tends to be very regular.  She also has said that she thought she felt her period coming on a couple days ago but it never came, which we have read is a potential indication that she is pregnant.  Now she is having stomach issues as well, but this could very easily be attributed to how panicked we have been over the last couple of days.
 I've read all of the reports/testimonials/etc. I can find online and it only serves to terrify us more.  Is it common for a woman to miss her period by up to a week or so?  I know that a pregnancy test is our best option but I believe we are still a bit too early to be attempting it, so even a negative result at this time would not fully satisfy us because we'd be afraid we did it too early.  Any advice or insight that can be provided would be very appreciated.
