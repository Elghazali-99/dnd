Hi,
 I've always been quick to get explosively angry when dealing with my family. My mom says it's because I've seen my dad do it for so long that it's something I've picked up. It's the worst when I fight with my dad because he screams so much and I scream right back. We got into a huge fight today and then afterwords I had to drive my mom to the grocery store. On the way there, she broke down in tears telling me how hard it is for her to be in the middle of this, and how she wishes she could go back in time and do something different with me so that I would never get angry the way my dad does. She said that for at least the next 24 hours my dad will scream and scream at her about this (even though she had nothing to do with our argument) and she loves him but he never thinks about what the yelling does to her.
 Having my mom tell me she wishes she could change this about me, and showing me how bad it is for her really broke my heart. She has asked my dad to go to anger management classes but he refuses. I thought that if I got some help, it would make my dad's anger better because if he screams at me and I don't scream back, the fights wouldn't get so bad. 
 I don't want my mom to suffer like this anymore and obviously changing this would benefit me as well. My only problem is that I don't really know what to do. I thought there would be some sort of thing like Alcoholics Anonymous but for anger problems, but I can't find anything like that online. All I see is private therapists that specialize in anger.. But those are at least $90 a session and my insurance only covers $20 and I'm a student so I don't have any income. 
 Does anyone know of any program that can help? Or an online website that has been helpful to you? Or just any advise on what I should do next? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
