Hi Doctors and Experts,
 Just wanted to share my condition with you for getting an opinion, am getting anxious and will visit medical facility this weekend, couple of year back I observed lumps like painless spots appearing in body in my back,tummy and couple of them in hands. I consulted doctor over the same, he told me its a property called as Lipoma in which fat get deposited in any part of body forming lump and there is absolutely nothing we can do about it.
 I consulted further he told me not to worry, but over the year and recently I have observed some more spots similar to that coming up , what I observed in common is they are painless and there size is almost same, i don't feel if they are growing, but everyday am hearing about different type of cancer and that makes me anxious, as in all cases formation of lump is most common symptom.
 Just wanted to check with you guys if this something of serious concern for me.. to add further over the two years
 1. I never had any fever or chills
2. I didn't had any sudden drop of weight
3. Never felt tiring, nor i saw blood in stool or vomit
4. Never had pain in throat or felt trouble in swallowing.
  What should i ask my doctor, are there any procedure or test which can be done for identifying any source of possible cancerous tissue in body?
 Please respond, I will be really helpful.
 Regards,
Robin.
