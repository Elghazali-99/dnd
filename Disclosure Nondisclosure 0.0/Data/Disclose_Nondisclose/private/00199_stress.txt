Hi, I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm April and am looking for ways to deal with stress in a healthy way.Does anyone have any good ideas for the best way to deal with stress? I guess I don't deal with stress very well. I internalize a lot. I also can let things overwhelm me if I'm not careful and can get almost panicky. I worry a lot. I'm a bit of a perfectionist and also a people pleaser so I do get stressed easily when things seem to get out of control.I do want to learn ways to handle stress well as I feel this even affects my health. I've had a lot of stress over the years, especially the last few years and it's taken a toll on me. I don't sleep well. I think too much! And worry. 
I know people say to take a deep breath, do yoga, or whatever, but when you're really stressed, you honestly can't think that way, you know? I guess I need to learn to catch it before it gets that bad maybe? Anybody else relate? There is one thing that helps a little; talking to a friend. So, if anyone just wants to chat to calm down, maybe we can help each other! :)
