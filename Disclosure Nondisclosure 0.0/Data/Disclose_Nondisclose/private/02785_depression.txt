Hi! I'm Alex, i'm 16 and since october 2012 i have this continuous pain on the right side of my head, i can't make the difference between a migraine or a very strong headache..i've made any possible medical analysis but no doctor could tell me what's wrong with me..and this thing started when i was in the 9th grade..i did't make any friends in high school so..yeah i'm kinda lonely..and my parents are divorced, i live with my grandparents..but uum..i don't feel like i have a psychological reason to feel depressed because i got over it..but this headache or pressure or whatever it is it's just unbearable..and i feel sad all the time..i already tried to kill myself 3 times because of it(tried to OD..some heart pills..i just felt a little high but not in the good way..and i didn't even pass out..made the tests again..i'm 100% healthy) so i'd be very very very very grateful if someone could tell me what could possibly give me those continuous excruciating headaches, if the depression can give you this kind of headaches and what should i do to..i don't know..fight it..resist it..cause i don't wanna end up dead..I'M TOO YOUNG TO DIE!!! sorry if i misspelled any words..i'm not english..
