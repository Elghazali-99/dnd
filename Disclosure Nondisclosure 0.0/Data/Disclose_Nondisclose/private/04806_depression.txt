Don't even know where to start? This is my first baby and for the first time I don't have anywhere to turn to. So here I am.. My boyfriend and I have been going through a lot. I try really hard in this relationship. Lately when we argue it turns bad and he instantly start popping off about how he doesn't think the baby is his, or trying to kick me out, he's took everything too far its hard to keep up. I catch myself crying constantly from what he says to me. Sometimes when we start fighting he makes fun of my weight and I just started to show.. Its weighing on me and its getting hard to hold on. He asked for a break from me today because we got in s stupid petty fight. I don't think people actually understand how bad it hurts coming from the father of your child. All I wanted was to happily finish this pregnancy with him and enjoy it. Seems the opposite. Do I go back to that? I haven't had sex with anybody but all I hear is how he doesn't think its his? Im finding myself now at my parents in my old bed, depressed as ****. How do you call someone the love of your life when you get treated like that...
