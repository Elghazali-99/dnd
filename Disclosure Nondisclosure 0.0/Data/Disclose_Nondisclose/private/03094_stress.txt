About 2 months ago I had a really bad headache that was more pressure than a regular headache, then it all reflected on my neck, so I went to the chiropractor and it felt better and I kept going for a month and a half. Everything seemed fine, but then about a month and a week I got another bad headache which wasn't really bad, but it didn't go away, just flows from low to moderate level. Next, i went back to the chiropractor but this time no relief. So, I went to a regular physician and he told me that it seemed a tension headache because it was my neck and the sides of my head so he prescribed Fioricet, which I take at bedtime. It works great for the night. In the mornings is not bad, sometimes I feel lightheaded or with a little headache than shortly goes away. During the day, I feel mostly fine but then pains start showing on me, my throat starts hurting that I don't even want to talk, it's itchy and feel irritated. Other days my ears starts hurting, actually in front of it toward my cheek and I can feel it connecting to my throat. I even thought I had mumps. It felt like that. I've gone to the doctor and he says that my ears look fine, and my throat is not bad. I am taking antibiotics amoxicilin but I don't feel any difference. Could all these symptoms be related? I mean random head spasms, ear and cheek pain, sore throat so painful and then they all just go away and as fast as they go they come back. One day it can be in my right side the other day it could be in the left one. I don't understand! has anyone experience something like this? Please, I don't even want to go to the doctors since they look at me like I would be telling lies or being crazy.Something else I can add is that I have issue with stress and I even had gastritis since I was 16. Anyways, I just want to know if anyone knows if al these symptoms could be related to stress?
