My Ex broke up with me via Text about 5 weeks ago as she moved 5 hours away, I accepted the Break Up and never plagued her with Text's or Call's
She kept me on Facebook, but I never ever contacted her there in about 5 weeks, nor did I contact her any other way, I am as certain as I can be that she was stalking my profile on Facebook, I even created a Group on Facebook and she joined it shows you on a group who looks at the pictures, and she did look at two of the tree pictures, then she stopped looking for some reason, maybe because she could see I could see she had been looking who knows,then one night when I came in from work I posted on my Status how successful I had been at work and it must have been down to my Aftershave ETC ETC, I did it to show her I was moving on with my life as I was told is the best thing to do, anyway a day later she changes her Relationship Status to Single, maybe just coincidence I don't know, moving on a week
I am on Facebook chatting to girls showing her that I am getting on with my life, I knew she was online as she posted on a mutual friend's wall, so I posted a picture, just a picture of my name in Graffiti, this will have gone on her wall and she was online, then a young attractive girl called "Kirst" starts sending comments about the picture and she bets I have lots of dark secrets and winking, she also said she really liked one of my ( Face ) pictures, so I go offline get ready for work, when I get back home surprise surprise I am blocked on my Ex's Facebook? plus she has blocked all of my Family Members who were also on her friends list? why do you think she blocked everyone? she ended it with me, and did so by text, and not even a nice text, she moaned at me and then simply said she wanted to go her own way :/ can anyone shed any light on this mad going on I am lost :/
