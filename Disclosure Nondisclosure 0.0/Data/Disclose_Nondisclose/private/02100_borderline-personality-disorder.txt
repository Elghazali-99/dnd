Hello 
Over The Past 3 Weeks Ive Been Really Struggling With Some Really Nasty Thoughts Of Wanting To Hurt Others. Which Is Really Distressing For Me So My Thoughts Turn To Me and Been Struggling With Thoughts Of S/H and Suicidal Thoughts. 
Ive Had These Thoughts In The Past Which Got Me Into Alot Of Trouble and The Police Got Involved As I Was Making Threats To Kill. Well Things Went From Bad To Worse and I Ended Up Self Medicating With Alcohol and Pills and Had To Be Rushed To Hospital. Whilst Cuffed and Restrained By 4 Police Officers and 2 Paramedics As I Went Completly Nuts. Long Story Short I Ended Up Getting A 136 Section. 
So I Approached My Team and Asked For Help 2 Weeks Back and It Was A Complete Waste Of Time. I Asked For Admission and They Wasnt Interested Just Told Me To Go Sit In A&E Which Is Something I Cant Do. Mum Normally Takes Me and Keeps Me There Till Im Seen. But She Was Away On A Buisness Trip. 
A Week On and Im Still Struggling I Feel As Tho My Team Isnt Taking Me Seriously and I Dont Know What To Do?? 
Its Starting To Get Out Of Hand Now and Ive Started To S/H Again and Im Not Sure Im Going To Be Able To Stop Myself. I Dont Want To Be Told To Go Sit In A&E For Hours To Just Be Sent Home. Ive Had To Beg For Admission In The Past and I Dont Think That Is Right. I Ask For Help and It Doesnt Get Acknowledge. 
What Do I Have To Do For Them To Listen To Me and Take Me Seriously??
You'd Think They Would Want To Nip Sumink In The Butt Before It Got Out Of Hand But Nope They Want It To Get Out Of Hand Then Stand There and Scratch There Heads Wondering Where It All Went Wrong
 Sorry For The Rant I Needed To Get That Out Of My Head As Ive Got No One To Talk To
