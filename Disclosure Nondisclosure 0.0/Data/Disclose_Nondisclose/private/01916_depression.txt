HI.  I have been on generic remeron since 12/23/2013 with 7.5 mg at bedtime to help with anxiety.  While on the generic remeron, I have also been taking Wellbutrin 300 mg since September 2013.  My doctor put me on the remeron to help with the depression & anxiety.  The panic/anxiety attacks just got worse.  So I called my doctor and she said to stop taking the remeron, and put me on 50 mg of generic zoloft.  I started the generic zoloft 1/24/2014, a little over a week.  When she put me on the zoloft, I still had 6, 7.5 mg generic remeron to take so I went ahead and took them at bedtime.  The last dose of generic remeron I took was Wednesday 1/29 at bedtime.  Today, I get up as normal and start my day then about noon, I started to get very, very nauseous, diarrhea, jumpy, loud noises make me worse. I took some pepto pills until my pharmacy could get my generic Zofran filled and it helped a little.  I thought I would eat something, thinking that might be the problem.  When I finished eating I was ok for about 15 minutes after, then began to get very nauseous again.  When I got my generic Zofran in my hand, I put one under my tongue.  It helped with the nauseous feeling, then I fell asleep and slept about 3 hours.  When I woke up, the nauseous feeling came back, along with the jumpiness, diarrhea, and irritiablity to loud noises ( my son, screaming and crying for being spoiled).  I am so miserable right now that it is affecting my husband and my 2 year old.  Could this be from the Remeron withdrawal?  If so, what is the after life of the medication, and what can I do tonight 2/1 and tomorrow 2/2 to keep from feeling this way and help my family to not get the affects of my symptoms?
