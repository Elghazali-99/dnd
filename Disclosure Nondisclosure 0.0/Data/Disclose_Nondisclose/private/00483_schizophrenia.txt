I have struggled to cope at times with my 11 year old daughter's behaviour and have done for quite a few years. she can be very aggressive, runs off slams doors screams and shouts, throws major hissy fits and has what I would call a very bad attitude and seems to have a problem with rules and boundry's, having said that there does seem to be two side of  her as she also is polite, loving and a dream to be with, she is always very popular in and out of school and as we move house alot (due to husbands carrer )she always make friends quickly and easily and becomes very popular quickly although things at home seem to be worse. we have recently placed her into boading school due to the disruption of moving and new school's and thought with a steady routine and the stability etc would do her good and possible sort out many of the behaviour problems and that she may even apprieciate the time with us when she's home at weekend's and holiday's.  However we have been informed by the school of an unusal incident and a major hissy fit where she informed them that the reason she behaved that way is due to voices in her head, that tell her to act in that way, she also said she has said this many times in other school's but they did not beleive her and obviously we have not been informed of this! I must admit that even though she has not said that to me before she has said that she cant help in the way she had behaved and did not know why she had behaved like she did and is alway's very sorry and regretfull. I have no idea what I should do anymore and a way forward please help ???,
