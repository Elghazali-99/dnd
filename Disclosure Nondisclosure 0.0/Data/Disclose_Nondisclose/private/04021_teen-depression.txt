Hi, I'm a 14 year-old girl and I think I might have depression. Or anxiety. Or something, I really don't know how to go about identifying it. I started suspecting it a couple weeks ago, while looking up symptoms of mental disorders for a class project. Apparently, I identify with many of them, especially for depression and anxiety. I haven't been motivated at all for about one and half years now. I procrastinate and leave projects to the last possible minute, and even while doing things I supposedly enjoy (writing, drawing), I have no passion whatsoever. The main reason I do it is because it distracts me and allows me to concentrate on something other than thoughts. 
 I have this strange feeling in my chest, or, more accurately, two feelings: one is hammering, quick, that feeling when your chair is about to tip over, as if someone's always standing behind me but I can never see them. I've found I look around the room a lot more. The other feeling is more based in my stomach (if there's any real 'place' for it). It's slower, more of a reluctant acceptance of impending doom. In short, one is feeling danger nearby and anticipating it while the other feels danger as well, but it's in the future and I already accepted that it's going to happen. Usually, feeling #2 is in charge. I feel empty, numb, when that's the case, feeling only that something bad is going to happen and I can't to anything about it.
 I haven't had a panic attack (yet). I bite my nails. I hardly sleep. I have a lot of acquaintances and one person I call a friend, but she's not a REAL friend, y'know? I left all of my real friends in elementary school. No enemies. Never been bullied. No money problems. Nice childhood. Great relationships with my family, including sibling. No previous romantic relationships. Way too shy for my own good. Getting really low grades (lack of motivation).
 I have not told anyone else of this potential issue.
