Hello, my name is Devon and i would like to start off saying, I am an addict, plain and simple no gimmics no nothing. But i would just like some advice from those who have had a problem with Narcotics such as....well mainly percocet. I had a back injury from wrestling a few years ago and ever since had taken pain pills. Shortly after, I started snorting them and have been ever since and would like to know if thats in a different category of addiction that needs to be dealt with differently? And im not even sure how i would go about dealing with it, i have quit before like most and relapsed. It just seems as if i make it through the detox get back in shape doing good and then out of no where im back where i started and i feel like a peice of crap for doing so, weeks after detox my nose is still running and burning and things of that nature....I'm not really sure where to start....but i will be 18 in about 3 weeks and would love to say im sober, on my 18th birthday. I believe that it will be a huge boost in moral as if to say i could do it, but im so sick of withdrawls that i can't even convince myself that this time will be any different than the last, many many times.
