Hi, I don't know if I'm just being petty or this really is abuse!?
I am 23 weeks pregnant my bf says he is happy but the way he talks to me and treats me is getting a joke. Being pregnant I feel sick a lot so I was taking a lie down and I hear him banging doing something so I ask if he wants help he replies just f****ng shut up you make it worse and storms out....what did I do ?? If I say something and he don't understand what I mean he goes off on one telling me to talk properly etc and just shutup, if I forget something he goes mad at me but when he forgets something its a different story if I cry he goes mad so I have to wipe the tears quick just so we won't argue...if I go to bed early or stay up late I'm in a mood...I just can't win whatever I do. Its realy getting me depressed now and I don't know what to do. Maybe once the baby arrives things will be better ? I have no family or friends just my bf if I leave I have no where to go I have no job or no money as I work for my partner so he supports me finacialy (wich the only thing he is good at) he will give me whatever I want in that respect...please give me advice.
Many thanks
