so today i picked my soon up from his dad's just like every other weekend. recently my son startled holding and pulling on his penis all the time and he mostly does it when he comes home from his dads. also he wants the light on in his room wakes up almost every night and has had a few (2-3 accidents) in the last few weeks which he has not had since he is potty trained. i do know accidents happen but since he potty trained a year ago he has never had any accidents until recently. tonight he told me his brother holds and squeezes his pee pee and he tells him to stop. my son is going to be 4 and his brother is 5. this concerns me since his brother does go to counseling for behavioral problems. i made a report to dfs. did i over react or do the right thing? i am not one of those mom's who calls dfs for every little thing but i was sexually abused when i was younger and still deal with the results now and i do not want that for the future of my son. i am supposed to protect my baby.
