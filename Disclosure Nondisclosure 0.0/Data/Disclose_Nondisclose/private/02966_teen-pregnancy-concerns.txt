Hey y'all I'm new to this forum, I'll get right to the point & hopefully I can get some helpful advice! So me and my girlfriend had sex on the 6th of this month... The condom had broken & we knew we had a problem on our hands so we decided to take next choice.. Which is the generic plan b? Anyways... She took the pill 20 mins after the incident( period usually comes on the 20th)... Couple days went by fine no problems.. Around the 5th or 6th day light bleeding occurred along with some greenish goupy discharge... She is now complaining about back pains and tender breasts... She continues to bleed very lightly every other couple days... She is now 2 days late... We took 5 hpts, 4 being + 1 being -.... We went n got blood work done yesterday.. Sure enough came back positive, I believe her levels were around 140?.. The dr said even tho the blood work came back + doesn't mean she's still pregnant.. He mentioned tnat it could be residual hormones left throwing the test off... So maybe she was pregnant and the plan b worked?? Idk I'm so confused I need help!!!!
