I've got a hard bone type lump, that's painless on my scalp, behind my ear. I've have terrible headaches on the same side too. Mostly in my temple area that radiates into my cheekbone and jaw. The skin is sore to touch as well. Feels like it's bruised. The headaches are horrendous. Facial twitching and jaw jerking. My neck feels like there's pressure on the left side (same side as lump and headache).
 I've got small tender lumps in both armpits. And swelling of the neck on the left side. My doctor has referred me for an ultra scan.
 Tingling in feet and legs, and electrical spark type pain in my legs. And the left arm, shoulder and hand feels heavy, stiff, and seizes up. When I life my arm up, it feels right in the armpit area.
 I've been having inner tremors, but not sure if it's my organs or muscles. There a lot of muscle twitching too.
 What could all these be caused from? I'm really worried, something just doesn't feel right. My doctor has dissmised my concerns, she didn't even ask any questions on what I've been experiencing.
 I feel certain there's something going on that needs medical attention, but hoe will I get anywhere if doctors won't take me seriously?! I'm scared :(
 I would really appreciate any advice or even to read that someone else has had similar symptoms.
