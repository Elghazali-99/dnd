My daughters live in boyfirend is obsessed with communism,germans and Chez Garvas. He will dress in German clothing and sit around the house with all the medals and stuff he can buy online. He thinks all official people ie police offices and government officials are crooks. Doesn't believe in God or religion period.
There was a car accident a while ago when someone rear ended his car, the other person was drinking and he pulled the man from the car and beat him and than kicked in the side of the car door.... now he is obsessed about that all of the time and is calling around trying to find information about him, if he looses his car keys in the house he rant and raves cursing and swearing in a rage over that. I am so concerned about all of this he is nearly 50 years old the big concern I have is why would a man that age like to dress in German clothing and sit around the house smoking cigars ( he doens't smoke as a rule) my daughter stopped him from doing that and now he goes to his 78 year old mothers house to do it.
My daughter is a nurse so she isn't stupid and now shes the one in councelling I am so worried about all of this and some times I have concern for her safety altho he has never physcially abused her. Why in heavens name would a man of this age have these intrests also he has an online addiction to porn.
If there is anyone there who can offer me some advice as to what to do here as I really feel he is mentally ill.
