MY HUSBAND AND I WERE TOGETHER FOR 23 YEARS, HE BECAME ADDIDTICTED TO VICODIN AND SOMAS FOR THE LAST 8 YEARS. WE HAVE 3 BEAUTIFUL GIRLS TOGETHER. I LEFT OUR HOUSE ALMOST 3 YEARS AGO CAUSE I COULDNT DEAL WITH THE ROLLER COASTER OF HE DRUG ABUSE. I WORKED 2 JOBS AND TOOK CARE OF HOUSE AND GIRLS. COULD NOT DO  IT ANYMORE PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. OUR 3 GIRLS DECIDED TO STAY WITH HIM BECAUSE (I FEEL) THAT THEY WANTED TO TAKE CARE OF HIM. I NEVER WANTED THAT FOR MY KIDS. HE HAS NEVER BEEN A BAD DAD, HE WAS  A BAD SPOUSE, BAD PARTNER AND A HORRIBLE PROVIDER. HE IS ON DISABILITY AND I PAY CHILD SUPPORT FOR MY GIRLS AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT THEY MAY NEED AND DESIRE. I STILL WORK 2 JOBS, DAY AND NIGHT 6 DAYS A WEEK WITH ONE NIGHT TO SPEND WITH GIRLS. HIS ADDICTION IS SO BAD, MY OLDEST DAUGHTER JUST TOOK HIS BOTTLES AND COUNTED HOW MANY PILLS HE TOOK AND HE HAS TAKEN 23 VICODIN AND 23 SOMAS IN LESS THAN A 24 HOUR PERIOD. NOT THE FIRST TIME HE HAS DONE THIS. HE TAKES THEM LIKE THIS EVERY MONTH WHEN HE GETS THE SCRIPTS. NOW I FIGURED HE WOULD STOP FOR OUR GIRLS BUT OBVIOUSLY IT IS THE SAME AS WHEN I LEFT 3 YEARS AGO. NOW WE ARE AT A STAND STILL AND DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO FOR HIM. ANY ADVISE, I KNOW THIS CANT BE GOOD FOR HIS BODY AND I FEEL LIKE ME AND MY GIRLS ARE JUST WATCHING HIM SLOWLY KILL HIMSELF. PLEASE HELP!!!!~
