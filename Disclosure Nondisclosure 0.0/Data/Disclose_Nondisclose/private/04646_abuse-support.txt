Hi all, i was strangled 10 days ago by a male neighbour and i can cope with the pain in my throat but i just want to ask, how to manage and deal with the trauma. I'm having panic attacks and nightmares about being strangled and i cannot stop thinking about the attack i am absolutely caught up with fear and anxiety and the attack, I have been told i may need to go homeless if i am to afraid to go home so i am staying with my sis right now but only short term. I have also reported this attack to the police and as no one seen or heard anything the police may not be able do anything and i didn't report the crime for 3 days as i am petrified what the outcome will be so the police cannot get his dna from my neck. I am so afraid he will come back and finish me off  now that i have reported him to police. The male neighbour suffers from mental health and also abuses alcohol and drugs. where i live there is no homeless accommodation for homeless people so would have to survive on the streets and as i single female i am also terrified of this too. No matter were i turn it seems everything is set out to suit my attacker and he cannot be evicted from his flat unless he is found guilty for what he did to me. I am at a total loss and don't know where to turn to now can anyone give me any advice as i am not able to think clearly and for myself as i regret going to police now as my attacker attacked me over something petty and untrue somewhere in his mixed up mind he believed i borrowed and owed $3 and i have never once borrowed cash from him or that was only an excuse to attack and robbed me. any help or advice would be fantastic even if it's just for my anxiety and fear and the pain is the last thing on my mind right now to be honest... any advice?
