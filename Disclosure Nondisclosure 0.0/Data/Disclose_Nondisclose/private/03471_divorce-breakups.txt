Ive known my boyfriend for 15 years, we have been in  relationship now for 3 years and have a child. We both have children from previous relationships. Right here goes. .
 she hates me, she is best friends with his ex and together they make my life hell.  They make  comments towards me and my boyfriend doesn't see it.  One night my bf and I had a squabble, naturally he ran to mummys.  I went to her house. (5 doors away!) With my 4 week old baby I  the rain and zhe closed the door in my face.  There is also another ex with a child which the other 2 hated up until now of course. So I have all 3 plus the sister hating me.  I had a misscarrage at 17 weeks and the woman didn't give a dam,  she went out partying with his ex which really hurt me. I get ignored by his family and so do my other children.  She takes him out valentine's day as she says its her late sons birthday but would be nice to be included. She even asked him to go on holiday with her saying,  she wants her family together. I never get invited to family events but he goes.  
Last xmas she brought me huge underwear and I was up set over it and this year for my birthday she went even bigger and a bar of chocolate.  It made me cry in front of my  children. 
My boyfriend said im jealous and ungrateful.  All I want is my own lil family and its making me ill that my children and i are being treated this way.  As when they invite him out he takes our son and leaves us behind.  Please someone give me some advice.   Is it me being jealous and selfish????
