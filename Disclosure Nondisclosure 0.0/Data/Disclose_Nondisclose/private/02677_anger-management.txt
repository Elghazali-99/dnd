Hi, im a 23 year old female + a mum of 1, beautiful lil boy who is 2 an a half. I have been with my boyfriend nearly 5 years. When we get on its great but when we dont its awful. We are both fiery when we get goin but reacently even when he trys to talk to me after an argument to sort things out i scream at him and shake, because i dont want to talk anymore after the row. I just make it a whole lot worse by doing this + blow thing way out of proportion most of the time. Iv started hitting myself in the head when i get really mad. But as soon as its over i feel normal again and also embarassed and ashamed of myself, i started having panic attacks around the same time this started but my attacks come from nowhere. Not when having arguements or feelin angry. Sometimes i wake up the next day with lumps on my head. why have i started doing this? please if anyone can help i would appreciate it so much. I just want to be a normal mum to my beautiful Son. It makes me feel like im not good enough for him. I dont want 2 keep doing this. I hope this makes abit of sense to someone as im not very good at describing in detail.
