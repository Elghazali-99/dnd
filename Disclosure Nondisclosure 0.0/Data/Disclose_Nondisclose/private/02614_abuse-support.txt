I don't know what to do I know it can't be good, I have been with my husband for 19 yrs. I am so sick of his yelling at me and my three kids 16,9,6 it's getting to the point my kids are always saying they are sorry for stuff they shouldn't have to apologize for, I am lost and confused, I am so sick of his yelling and making everyone feel like there always wrong and he is always right. I have done a ton of research and all I come up with is emotional abuse for the things he does, I really don't like the word emotional abuse, there is no way to prove it in a court of law.. So what do I do? we have separated in the past, but he made sure to get 50/50 custody and I don't have the money to fight it, we are doing marriage counseling now, but she hasn't picked up on what the problem is, he has her believing its a communication problem, but I plan on bringing up some other things that I hope will help me and my children we can't keep living like this I don't know what to do any advice?
