Hey, I am worried that I might be pregnant. I got my first ever depo shot around March 9th of this year, it's now April 14th , a little more than a month after my shot and I am experiencing pregnancy symptoms as described below.: slightly more visible blue veins in my breasts, lower arms,hands, and upper chest (above my breasts). Just in these past few days I've felt fatigued, my appetite has increased a lot, swollen breasts, i feel bloated, a little dizzy, and moody. I am overweight, polycystic ovarian disease, never had regular period in my life,on my first time ever depo shot,19, and extremely scared. On an added note, I had unprotected sex 6 days after my first shot and have had unprotected sex a few times since then. Also, I was put on the diet pill Phentermine the same day I was put on depo and I have recently (within the past 7 days) gone off Phentermine due to irritability, aggression, and mood swings. I don't know what to think of all of this and I feel as if I'm going crazy. Please, someone give me some insight as to what this could be. Thank you
