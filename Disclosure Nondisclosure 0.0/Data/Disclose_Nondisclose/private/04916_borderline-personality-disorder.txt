My boyfriend is driving me nuts. He is comfortable with me now to the point where he doesnt ever hold my hand or be affectionate with me at home or in public. I feel rejected by him for this and want to say or do things to hurt him so he knows how I feel inside. (yes Ive talked to him about it and couples therapy did not work and Its not bad enough for me to leave) Anyway a new friend of my best friend is very interested in me and even though Im not interested in him at all and Im somewhat happy in my chaos I still love the attention Im  getting from this new man. Who wouldnt?! But Im finding myself wanting to be around him now even though I only met him once just to feel wanted again. This is what I always do. I get obsessed with someone until I toy with their emotions leading them on for years then just breaking their heart because I never wanted anything with them to begin with. I just wanted attention from my bf and thats it. My bf is awesome though. Im just never satisfied with my situation. The grass is ALWAYS greener on the other side until you get there. I just want to be happy for once with where I am. Anyone is this self sabatoge cycle as well?
