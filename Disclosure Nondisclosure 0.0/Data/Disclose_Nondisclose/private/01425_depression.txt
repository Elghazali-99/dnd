A month ago I was prescribed Zoloft.  I started out taking 25mg then 1 week later I moved up to 50mg.
 Two weeks after I started taking the pills I woke up when one in a state of fright.  I wasn't sure what had happened to have caused that experience but it was very frightening.  Two days after that experience it happened to me again, only this time I wasn't asleep, however, I was lying in bed and my eyes were closed.  I heard something like a pop and felt something like a jolt which caused my body to react.  The feeling was very intense and the jolt/spasm was very powerful, I was ready to check myself in the hospital.
 After the 2nd experience I looked up the side effects of zoloft as well as posting on this site and I discovered that a side effect of Zoloft is Sleep myoclonus also known as hypnic jerks.  I've had several such experience and it has gotten so bad I have now decided it's time to go off the drug, I hardly had much sleep last night because every time I tried to sleep I experienced hypnic jerks.  I am at the point where I am afraid to close my eyes.
 I wont be able to see my doctor until Tuesday, so today I lowered the dose of the pills (I didn't want to abruptly go off of it) by taking 25mg instead of 50mg.
 Has anyone experienced constant hypnic jerks while on Zoloft?
 Initially, the jerks originated in what seemed like my lower back, limbs but now it's affected my head.  Like I said, it's a frightening and annoying experience.
