Hi there folks ! i have little problem. i am a 19 years old guy, ex addict. i thionk i can hear other peoples toughts in my mind, i am pretty shure about it because when i get psychotic i tell weird things to those voices what is kinda funny (not at all) some people told me exactly what i have told. i want this nightmare to stop i prefer to think im getting schizophrenic instead of being a telepath but this **** is gettin eaven worse those days i cant function normally my every tought is heard. i was partying way to hard with hard things.  i am pretty shure that what i am saying is true i mean the voices. ill give an example. i was listening to music on my headphones. and some of the voices allways tell me to stop it or what the **** are you listening to, and i asked them why i dont hear their music. the answer way because your using headphones. the very next day my friend (not my neighbour) said to my hi there headphones and i was like wtf ?!!!??
 excuse me cursing grammars and interpnction.(im not an english i come from east europe)  i am really scared, paranoid, less active psyhicly btw i have problems with subvocalisation.
