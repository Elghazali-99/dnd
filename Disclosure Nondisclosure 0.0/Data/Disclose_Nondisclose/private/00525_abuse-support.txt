I have been masterbating since I can remember, and I always reached orgasm; I didn't know about sex but I liked doing it because I felt 'naughty' and when I was a bit older (from the age of 6) I used to think about seeing a boy naked and wanting to touch them. I also had thoughts of having a penis and going to the toilet with the boys.
 When I was playing with my friend, we used to pretend to get married (to big teddy bears) and have babies and I would make us 'pretend' to have sex with the teddy bears and I would masterbate to orgasm.
 During my teenage years I had issues with sexuality and my sexual identity. Sometimes I thought I was gay, sometimes I felt straight, sometimes I wanted to have a sex change to be a boy.
 In my early 20s I became very sexually active, I was reckless and 'doing' whoever wanted too.
 I have also had a lot of issues with anxiety and stress. Despite this I did very well at school and was an over achiever.
 I am currently engaged to a wonderful man and am loyal to him. In the last 2 months I have been diagnosed with boderline line personality and bipolar 2. I have been hospilized and spent a night in jail (for violent/manic behaivour).
 I am working through all these issues with a councellor but I cant help wonder if I was sexually abused when I was younger (I have vague memories of something not right but have zero idea who it would have been and if it is even true or I am making it up).
