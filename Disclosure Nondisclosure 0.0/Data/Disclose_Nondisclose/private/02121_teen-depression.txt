im 18 years old male/ About a month ago I was brought to the hospital after threatening to kill myself with pills. They didn't keep me there, tey gave me wellibutrin/trazodone and sent me home. I see a phycologist every week. Things were getting better, I was getting out of bed and got a job lined up. However suddenly things are getting worse, my medication is not working anymore but my doctor wont give me anything different or new until I get my life better. I am scared because I am feeling very depressed again and feel like asking for more help again. However I am afraid because if I ask for more help they will keep me in the hospital. My parents will get all scared and paranoid again. I wont be able to start my job which begins in two weeks. In result I will be stuck here at home longer. I can either fight and cry through the pain and hope that when I get busy things will change, or risk it all and maybe get the real help I need. I'm not suicidal again but very depressed and on the couch all day crying.
