This question could fit under several categories i'm sure. about 2 years ago i met a guy that came into the restaurant i worked at. i was 17 and we hit it off we started talking and he told me he was 22 which was not accurate . we dated for 2 weeks and things started to get strange he was pressuring me to have sex and wanting me to take him to buy drugs. it took me a while to find out that he had no job, no car, no house, no money and he became very abusive when i tried to leave. i would leave and he would call me a few weeks later or a month later and tell me he had changed that he had gotten straight and all those things. i gave him a second chance and he raped me in a cheap hotel room with my best friend sleeping in the next bed. after that i knew i couldnt see him anymore, but once again about 6 months later he said he had changed and that he really wanted to see me, he said he got an apartment and wanted me to see how well he was doing for himself. i went and one of his buddies got me on the floor and held me down while he raped me again. a few months after that i found out i had hpv he was the only man id ever been with so i know it had to be him. i am 19 years old and have been told that the hpv is a very high risk strain and that i may never be able to have kids because its so advanced. what i want to know is how can i get pasted this im 19 i havent been able to experience lots of things how do i accept this and move on?
