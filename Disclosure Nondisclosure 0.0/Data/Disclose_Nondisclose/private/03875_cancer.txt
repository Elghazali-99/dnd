Hello.......I am a 42 y/o female who has been DX with Sjogren's Syndrome back in April 2016. I have started experiencing excessive night sweating every night since mid September 2016. I am also having a hard time regulating my body temp, frequent chills, and loss of appetite (I have lost around 20 pounds with out trying.....tho the weight loss has slowed down).
 I started having burning, stinging pain in the backs of both my lower legs. So severe to where I can't bend my legs or even put on knee socks! The episodes last 3 - 4 days. This has happened twice this month! I take OTC NSAIDS and they do NOTHING for the pain. I am not on any prescribed pain meds at this time. 
 I had a nerve study done yesterday and just got notified that it came back normal! So I am assuming that means I do not have peripheral neuropathy?? Which is what I *THOUGHT* was going on. I am in the process of being referred to a new Rheumy right now but I am getting VERY concerned. Everything keeps pointing to Lymphoma........my last CBC back on 11/11/16 my HGB & Hematocrit were low back then and I haven't had a CBC since then so I have no idea if they've come up yet.
 Am I making a mountain out of a mole hill? If anyone has ANY insight as to what else MIGHT be going on, please chime in!! I'd appreciate ANY input!!
 Thanks so much!!
Lisa
