Hi.
I did a post some time ago but I wanted to write again. 
 I'm a 16 year old girl and depressed. I hate myself and blame myself for a lot. I have no friends at school and I hate it. I hate going to school because I know I will just be alone. Seeing everyone talking and laughing with their friends just makes me sad and want to cry. I use to cut myself but now I just use pins to pinch into my fingers or I will doing something else to cause a little pain. 
   I know doing that is wrong but I feel like I need to because its my fault that I'm this way. When at home I act all happy so they don't notice a thing but really I just want to cry. I'm worthless ugly useless and don't deserve to be here. I'm shy and can't even speak for myself. I'm at the age where all the girls have boyfriends and it makes me very sad. I've never even talked to a boy before. Seeing the couples together makes me wish that a boy would love me even if it was fake. But I know that will never happen.
  I cry to sleep every night crying and begging to just change or to disappear. I hate it. I hate myself. I hate my life. Why can't I just be happy? Don't I deserve to be happy at least once?
