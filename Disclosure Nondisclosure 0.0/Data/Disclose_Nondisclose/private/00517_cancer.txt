In 2007, I was diagnosed with bladder cancer, via a FISH urine test. A biopsy of the bladder tissue was done in a bid to confirm or refute the diagnosis. The result of the biopsy was negative; however, every time the FISH urine test was repeated, it showed cancer cells associated with the bladder.
I asked for treatment, but was told that BECAUSE the location of the cancer was not established, treatment could not be offered. Instead, I submitted to a cystoscopy every six months. 
I did this for two years (2007-2009), and one time between 2010 and 2013. Each cystoscopy showed a ‘healthy’ bladder with a diverticulum, and hardening wall lining.
In 2014, I did another cystoscopy, and FISH urine test. 
As it did in 2007, the FISH test in 2014 showed cancer cells of the bladder. This time a confirmation test (cytology) was done; and the cancer was confirmed. In June (2015), more biopsies of different parts of the bladder were done. They also came up negative; and of course, this means I cannot receive treatment, BECAUSE there is no target location to direct the treatment.
My doctor (urologist) describes this as a “slow moving cancer”, which will manifest at some point, and I will receive a targeted treatment. 
So, here I am -- eight years after the initial diagnosis of a killer disease, WITHOUT TREATMENT!!!
I am petrified of this so called “slow moving cancer” spreading slowly, and doing me in. 
I need help!!!
