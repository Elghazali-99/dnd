I'm thinking about talking to my PCP about going back on an anti-depressant medication. My dysthymia (chronic depression) is getting the best of me, and I'm nearly to the point that I don't really want to do anything anymore. 
 I've taken Effexor in the past, and it seemed to work well for me, but I really don't like the sexual side effects. 
 I've tried Wellbutrin, but won't ever go near that stuff again because it actually made me manic and also caused me to "road rage" (I actually chased someone with my vehicle), which I've never, ever done before. 
 I don't wan't to take TCA's because they turn me into a zombie (had taken Amitriptyline in the past and it made me groggy 24/7). I don't want to take NDRI's because that's what Wellbutrin is, and I want to avoid those side effects. Have considered the older SSRI's (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.), but they seem a little out of date and have worse side effects. 
 So that leaves me with Pristiq or Cymbalta (Remeron is another choice, but I haven't heard much about it).
 I've read the side effects and dangers for both, but am uncertain which one to go with. 
 Pristiq seems like it's very similar to Effexor, so would it have the same sexual side effects?
 And Cymbalta seems great until you read the part where your liver can explode if you drink alcohol (I rarely drink), plus it has also been used to treat chronic pain, which I do have. 
 So, has anyone taken either or both? And which one has worked better for you?
