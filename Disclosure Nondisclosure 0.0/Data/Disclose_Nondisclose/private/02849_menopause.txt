I am 41 years old and have a concern. My periods have been relatively normal up until the last couple of years. At the beginning of 2011 I went 47 days between periods and in Dec 2011 i had two periods 19 days apart and now I haven't had a period since Dec 27, 2011. I had my thyroid removed in July of 2008 and in Sept 2011, my specialist adjusted my meds so that I was taking .125 mg Mon to Fri and .112mg on Sat and Sun. After about a month of doing this I started getting pressure headaches so I wen to my Dr and found out that I had a sinus infection which ended up needing 2 sets of antibiotics to clear up, but after about 2 weeks the headaches came back and have not really gone away. In Dec, I decided to go back to the original dose of my thyroid meds, which was .125 mg everyday as an experiment because I was not feeling well at all. It helped somewhat but in Jan I went back to the new dosage because I was seeing my specialist in Feb. I have also been under major stress due to Hubby having bariatric surgery in Aug and being off work for twice as long as we had planned so money was a huge problem,  Hubby was treated with cyclophosmide about 16 years ago and was deemed sterile and we have not used birth control since. Anyway I have been having a strange tightening on my right side today but still no period. I am terrified to take a pregnancy test even though I know I am most likely not pregnant. My daughter is almost 19 so I really could not deal with a baby again, even though I have 3 one year olds everyday in my home daycare. Anyway, I guess my question is, could my lack of a period be caused by perimenopause, stress, meds or all of the above. If you got this far, thank you.
