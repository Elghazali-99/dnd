After having had a hysteroscopy which found 'no serious problems', but did show some Atrophy, I've been prescribed Vagifem 25mcg pessaries. I've started using them but was concerned to find on reading the patient leaflet that these are HRT and I'm wary about the risks. I'm  61 and have been post-menopause (with no menopausal problems) for several years. My only symptoms for having the hysterosocpy were slight spotting and brown discharge, and an ultrasound that showed irregularities of the womb lining though the lining was only 4mm. As I don't have any of the troublesome symptoms of vaginal itching, burning, soreness, dryness, which it seems are the usual reasons for using these pessaries, I wonder if the risk of using them is worth it. I've also found on the internet that the 25mcg has been discontinued in the US (I'm in the UK) and that only Vagifem of 10mcgs strength are now used there. I rang the hospital to try to speak about this to the prescriber but was told by the gyno's secretary that I would have to ask my GP. I'm now waiting for a GP appointment and using the pessaries meanwhile, but I wondered if anyone on the forum has experiences of them.
