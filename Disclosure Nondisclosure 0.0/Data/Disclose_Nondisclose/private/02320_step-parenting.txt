Hi there
 I'm new to this forum, and just wanted to ask if anyone else has been through anything like this. It doesn't look too bad from the outside, but I'm really struggling with it. Basically I am a mum of two boys and stepmom of two boys, all in their teens or early twenties. My older son is twenty and in the army, my younger son is nineteen and away at uni. My stepsons live with us half the time, the older one is twenty and is at a local college, and the younger one is sixteen and in the sixth form.
 It's over a  year since either of my kids lived at home, and in a way I think I might be suffering from empty nest syndrome, but in another way I'm still functioning as a mum type ligule because I still have my ss to lo after when they are here. It's really hard to be without my kids but still to be acting as a mum. So the nest is really only half empty. My dh is sympathetic, and he does know what it's like in a way because he has a daughter who he doesn't see, although it's not quite the same situation I know it causes him a lot of grief. 
 I just feel so mixed up, I miss my kids and I am glad there are still boys at home, but they're not my boys and it just feels like I'm going through the motions looking after them sometimes.
 Any thoughts anyone?
 Thanks 
 Sadie
