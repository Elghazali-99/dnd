I have not felt well at all in the last 2 months. In one and half months I lost 30 pounds. My doctor has been watching carefully my dramatic weight drop.  My health is a long story. I won't go into all of it. Anyway I had surgery for my back, the first week of December. Before surgery my MRI showed something I am unclear of at the moment (can't remember what it was) and then it showed what was described as on the MRI as Bone Marrow Edema.  After surgery the MRI showed post op edema. I pointed this out to my doctor, he said that was interesting that it was there before surgery as well. 
 Anyway, my bloodwork was all normal since surgery except my platelets. They have been high 3 out of 4 times since December 24th. My platelets are usually in the 200,000 some range. They've now ran around the 530,000 range.  Cancer does run in the family. 
 I was wondering how they diagnose cancer. I mean if there is any suspicion that a person can have it, where do they start? Do they do whole body scans or what to pin point where it is? 
 I have a brain tumor but it's been there for years and was told it was not cancerous but important to have it checked for growth every year. No one has, but incidently I saw some of my reports from being checked for my Chiari that I saw where it's now about (well as of 2 years ago) 5 to 6 mm depending on the radiologist measuring. It started as 1.3 mm. I am sure this is not the cause. However can tumors that are not cancerous turn cancerous? 
 Sorry for all of the questions. I am in the dark about what is going on with me. My doctor doesn't know yet.
