I just feel upset. I want to quit therapy, but my case manager said if I quit and stop taking my meds(which I did 2 weeks ago), then I loose my gym membership. It may not seem like a big deal, but the gym releases my weight pressures and help me not eat so much. Which makes me not hate myself so much. But I can't take my meds b.s I want the people inside me back. And meds keep them away. So I haven't taken them in 15 days. I want the gym, but isn't them more. And Im jut getting really upset b.c my case manager said its the Dr. That said I needed my meds, and he knows what he is doing. I mean, I already wanted to do things, but now I REALLY want to do things. Not b.c of lack of meds. I just wanted to do it since I left the hospital last month. And I was on meds then.... Okay, let's be honest here, I'm want to cut. But the cuts I want to do will lead me back to the hospital. So I was going to quit therapy so I won't be obliged to tell them. I just...I know it'll bleed a lot, and I want to be able to live, despite my feelings towards life right now, I want to live. I was thinking about sewing my cut up after I get done. There'll be a few cuts actually. I'm just scared, not to do it. Just that I have no one really to talk to that won't send me back to the hospital. Whats going to happen if I tell them my plans for cutting? I want to go to the wedding I'm in. And I leave for it next week. So I'm trying to make it till then. My care team won't really listen unless I take my meds, and I'm of going to take them. Not until my people inside me return. I want o cut for them. Cut pieces/chunks out of myself in their honor. I believe I killed them being forced to take medicine for 2 months I the hospital....and I'm waiting for them to return....they help me feel safer....not completely safe, but more comfortable to be outside. Now I'm always alone...without them, I'm nothing. I want them back, please help me out.....I dunno how,but please try?
