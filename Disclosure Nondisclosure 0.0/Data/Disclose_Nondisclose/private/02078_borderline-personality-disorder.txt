My son is 16. He's been in therapy since he was 3 due to conduct disorders such as ADD, medicated with Retalin for 3 years. Then its wasnt ADD and it was deppresion with auto mutilation which started when he was about 10. At one point he was considered a Maniac depressive. Then it was a Borderline personality...Was treated with antipsicotics with anti depressives. His IQ is of 130, is a lonely kid, has been doing websites since he was 12 lying about his age. Since he was 13 he went through a Marylin Manson period, then dark, then visual and now anime (japanese) which makes me happy because the music is happy and so is the style. Hes now been diagnosed with Corporal Dismorphic Disorder. Hes not medicated and is better, but he thinks people are always looking at him, hes died his hair about 20 times, uses coloured eye lens, his are brown the lens are blue. He thinks he is horrible, ugly and people say he is handsome just because they feel sorry for him. Not only is he handsome but a very kind, sensitive, harmless (to others) person. I've noticed that when in public, he walks on tip toes sometimes. I'm really confused. I graduated last year as a psychologycal counselor to try to help and understand him. His mood shifts is a second flat. The good thing is he doenst cut himself anymore and comes and tells me when he is down or feels lonely. Hes always been in therapy. His therapist is cognitive oriented and gets along with him very well. But if there is any information to help me as a mother, I would be very grateful.
