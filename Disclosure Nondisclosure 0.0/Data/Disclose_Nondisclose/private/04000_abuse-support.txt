When I was 13 I sneaked out to a club with my friend and after a couple of weeks got chatting to a well known lad Tony, he was 26 gorgeous looking and so popular I loved it ... He chatted me up and we kissed at the end of the night and my friend kissed his friend and we thought we were great it was the best night ever.Tony asked me if we could meet again and I said yes so every night for weeks he picked me up from my friends house and school in is top of the range car (I told Tony I was 17 and in sixth form )so what was really my 14 birthday Tony thought it was my 18, so we went for a meal and Tony had so many gifts for me I couldn't wait to show off to everyone in school .. After our meal and drinks Tony who was rather drunk by now wanted us to go back to his apartment which I was fine with knowing what he had on his mind and even thought I was 14 I wasn't scared of going that one step further from just kissing only it went 3 steps further and Tony rapped me and just left me bleeding on the bed saying I was just leading him on etc etc .... I ended up having an abortion 6 weeks later and never seen Tony again until 3 months ago 18yrs later  when he came into my place of work and we both got the shock of our lives I felt sick to the stomach and now find it harder to deal with then I did when I was a child, I don't know how to be and can't understand why I'm finding it so hard now than I did then, Tony has asked to meet with me he wants to apologise and I'm confused whether I should forgive and except his apologies because it was my own fault for trying to be the big girl and show off to all my school friends or not and carry on hating him.... He has also found out I was only 14 at the time and claims he's finding it hard to deal with himself because he has a daughter this age now what should I do PLEASE HELP x
