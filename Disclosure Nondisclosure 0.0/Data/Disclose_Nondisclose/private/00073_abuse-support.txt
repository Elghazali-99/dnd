Through reading other posts, I've seen a few members saying that they don't believe in recovered memories.
I'm curous to know what someone mat mean by that..
Is it that you don't believe that children suffering a traumatic event have the ability to block it out or is it that you just don't believe they can be recalled from that amnesialike state?
 I'm just curious since everyone that I've seen as a client has thought I've blocked out childhood trauma but that it's still not completely buried as I have vivid nighterrors they now diagnosed as flashbacks and PTSD. On one level I've always known but was so afraid of what happened and who could have traumatized me that I spent even more time in the past 5 years denying it and trying to bury it. 
I remember nothing past the age of 6-7 and the two memories I do have I couldn't say if they really were at age 7 instead of 9. 
 So that's why I'm interested to know what people believe about blocked trauma, amnesia or supressed memories and how they feel about whether someone can recall memories to some*(any)extent or whether someone believes that if you can't recall the actual memories than more than likely nothing happende dto begin with.
 Thanks for any opinions
