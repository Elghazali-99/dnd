Is this true or a myth.  My Dad has schizophrenia started age 29 before his brothers wedding he found out his brother was gay through finding him with another man and my father bought it out and was rejected by his family including his brother, they were very Catholic, traditional and my father worried about brothers future wife etc.  My father was cut out by his family, though in years that followed he was proved truthful.   Schizophrenia followed the incidence with his brother and the family rejection.  My father has had an awful life, I've watched it all.
 My friend, her brother started at 14 years old after his Dad left and rejected the family.  We often discuss this connection.
 Fast forward 40years, i did Ok, but did not pick a very good husband, he probably has Aspergers, certainly has a lot of difficulties.  My four kids are doing great.  My son had ADHD, very difficult childhood, i did everything in my power to bring up that boy without medication.  I got him through, but my husband he has totally rejected us all, he walked out one normal day before my sons final school exams.
 I am so worried.  It has been one year and my husband has no drive or urge to see the kids, my poor son, he is 18 and i worry about the effect of the rejection.  They argued a lot and on the day my husband left it was a good day, but he argued with our son.
 He is University overseas and he wont talk about it.  I meet him once or twice a Semester now + we talk on skype.
 What is the connection with rejection, thoughts on this please.
 Thank you
