Hi guys. I started taking Lexapro for my depression/generalized anxiety disorder about two years ago. For the first year, I took the drug every day as prescribed by the doctor. I didn't get any side effects which I thought was great. The drug wasn't of much help, though. A year ago, I decided to stop taking Lexapro on my own. I tried quitting it cold turkey but I wasn't able to follow through with it because of the withdrawal effects. I, then, decided to get back on it but only take it every other day. Two months later, I started taking it every three days; After some time I began taking it every four days. For the past month, I've been taking Lexapro once a week. I feel a bit dizzy every now and then, but I can deal with it.
 My question it, is it okay to do that? I don't think I'm ready to get off Lexapro, I really don't want to have to deal with these horrible withdrawal symptoms. But I can barely afford this drug at the moment. I cannot, by any means, take it every day.
