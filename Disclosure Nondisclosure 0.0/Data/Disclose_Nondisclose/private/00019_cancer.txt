Hi I'm 24 years old and I have this large and obvious lump on my right clavicle, I can see it in the mirror, it is hard and feels bony, it is not tender and there is no pain when I touch or press it, there is also another lump on the top of my shoulder, it looks as if the bone on top of my shoulder is just jutting out of its place, I don't have any pain, but some times I get this extreme feeling of discomfort like I need to move my arm somehow or stretch, my shoulder blade also has the same feeling of discomfort and there is always this feeling as if my bones are grating against something when I move my shoulder, so far my doctor said its just a real bad case of tendonitis, but I'm really not convinced, I've had this case for almost two months or so now and haven't exercised for the past two weeks and still there is no improvement and very recently (for the past week or so, since my last Dr visit) I would some times get pain in the bicep that could radiate down to the forearm or elbow it would only last a couple of seconds and is not really significant, it doesn't really stop me from moving my arms or distract me from my work...etc.
 Also today while just rubbing my head I noticed this really tiny (pea sized), very hard, solid bump on top of my head, on the right side, above the forehead and right at the place where the hairline ends, it feels like its part of (or fixed on) my skull, there is no pain when I press on it but skin moves on top of it freely and it remains fixed in place, I have no idea how long its been there.
 Is it cancer ?
