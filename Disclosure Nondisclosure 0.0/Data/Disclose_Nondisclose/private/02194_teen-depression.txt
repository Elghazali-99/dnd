Since the age of 5 I have suffered  from ADHD,now I'm 17 years old and my ADHD has gotten a lot better.
Because of my diagnosis I was eligible for social security.My mother suffers from schizophrenia and she is constantly paranoid that they might take my check away around the age of 10 my mother started forcing me to lie to my psychiatrist and say i was hearing voices when I never have in my life.She also has not allowed me to join regular ed classes in school for fear of social security learning of it.My sister is worse she has no empathy, she's vain materialistic, mean ,un compassionate ,stuck up ,dominating ,highly controlling and she cannot love another person.
The other day I told my sister  I no longer wanted to lie about my disability , I wanted to be normal she became angry and said that she's the only one that deserves to be depressed and that she wishes she was a teen again and that she's jealous of me. I then told my mother about how I feel and she started calling me selfish I told I wasn't going to lie anymore and my mom tried to commit suicide, I panicked and I ran to my sister for help and my sister said let her kill herself she's stupid. Because of my family's selfishness I have often  felt depressed , they don't really care about my feelings at all. And to top it all off I'm 17 with almost no friends I was bullied a lot when I was younger so I have trouble making friends I'm constantly thinking about what others might say if I talk to them. I wish that my family wasn't so horrible I wish I was born in another better family is that horrible to say? Please I don't know what to do I have no other family or friends that I can turn to.
