Things are building up and it is so hard to get through each day.  i think i will see if the doctor will put me in the hospital and find out exactly what is wrong.  i am so tired of feeling bad and these head aches are no picnic.  im afraid to go to the hospital they may not let me come home.  maybe i better think this out some more.  im to weak  to even throw a tv in the micro wave.  usually eat peanut butter and crackers or a balogna sandwich with cheese.  but it is getting harder to force it down.  i guess we are not going to have christmas it is suppose to be raining turning in to sleet one weather said it might snow.  and it is a long way to houston and all the gifts would get wet. some days i sleep all day and all night with out waking up.  i dont want to die.  i just want to be happy.  I hope all of you are doing good.  i tried to write to you a private letter but it said it was blocked.  dint know what im doing wrong.  mym niece let the deserted cat in tonight when she got home from walmarts.  he did not want to leave he is asleep in her chair,  he is so sweet but he bites some times.  that is enough.  i love you im scared.  m andy876
