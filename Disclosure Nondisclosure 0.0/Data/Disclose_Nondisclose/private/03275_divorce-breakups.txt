I have been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years and I am deeply in love with him. Before my boyfriend i had an ex that always wanted sex and took my virginity and i never wanted to have sex with my ex when me and him were together because i wasnt into sex at the time. I had sex with my ex 7 times all forced and he told me to suck him up but i only put my mouth on it and then told him "i dont like this i dont want to do it". But i didnt want to tell my boyfriend that because thats embarrassing and i didnt want him to feel like he had a used girl. The first time my boyfriend asked how many times i had sex with my ex i said 3 and no to giving head then the second time i said the same thing.. Then the third time i said 3 and yes to head but i just put my tounge on it and stopped and then yesterday my bestfriend mistakenly said something about my past to him and she said be had a look on his face like he was upset. He called me on my bestfriend phone and asked me again and i told him the truth. He got mad at me and told me he doesnt trust me anymore and that he doesnt want to be with me anymore. I cried and felt like **** because I didnt want him to think of me in that that type of way. I should have told him the first time he asked but i was scared because i found the one for me and i didnt want to ruin my chances with him. Later that night after the phone call he showed up to my house and told me he loves me because of all the moments we shared but he doesnt love me because he doesnt look at me the same anymore and he said that i was selfish for keeping it from him for so long he said i hurt him. I feel bad cause i messed up my relationship because i couldnt share my embarassing past with him. I went out with my ex 2 years before i started dating my boyfriend. I hurt myself because I hurt him..I messed up big time.
What do i do to help him forgive me? 
How do i get him to trust me? Because that was the only secret i been hiding from him.
