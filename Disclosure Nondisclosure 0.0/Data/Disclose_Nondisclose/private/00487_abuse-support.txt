Hi, I've never told anyone this before and it has never been mentioned by the people involved, but I have been thinking about it for years and wondering if it was normal...when I was young (i'm not sure what age but i remember when it started I wasn't old enough to feel uncomfortable about it, but I got older and gradually began to feel more and more uncomfortable) my grandmother used to sit me on her knee and bounce me up and down pretending to be a horsey, while she did this she would pat my 'private' regions which she had a special name for and repeat the name, but like in a fun happy way, as if it was a game? I remember the last time she did it my dad saw and he told her to stop it, I remember feeling really uncomfortable and confused about what was going on and why she was doing this. I still don't understand why, I'm really confused, do you think it was just normal silly behaviour or? 
I had quite a hard childhood aside from that (living in a house full of alcoholism, domestic violence, neglect etc) and always knew i had issues steming from those things, but i've always had a problem with sex and intimacy and a feeling that I've been repressing something, but that is the only memory I have of something happening that I think might be inappropriate. What do you think about that when you read it? 
 I can't ask anyone I know because I don't want to put it onto anyone. I'm a girl btw.
