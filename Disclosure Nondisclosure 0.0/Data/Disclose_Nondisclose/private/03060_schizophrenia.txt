My boyfriend went on a trip for couple of days and when he came back he told me that something has happened to him which he can't remember, he said he was hit on the back of the head and probably was out for a period of time.  He seems very confused and scared, he doesn't know me sometimes and he is constantly scared someone is going to harm him.  He looks like he is thinking hard all the time and when I talk to him many times he is just not there, it seems he just doesn't hear me.  He is confused, scared, and he seems to have lost a lot of memory.  He might also be imagining things or confusing things, he can't hold a proper conversation anymore and he's asked me who I was last night.  I am really really scared for him.  What could this be, is this a medical condition or is it something that could've happened on his trip and will go away.  I'm in tears and I really don't know what to do about it.  It has been almost a week since he's been back and it is not getting better.  What could this be?
 I'd really appreciate any information and advice you can give me.  Thank you.
