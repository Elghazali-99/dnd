Hi i'm 26 years old and since i can remember i have never reallly had a realtionship with my mum. Its always been a stranger sort of relationship if i have ever asked for anymore ( food, clothes, ironing, washing, even as young as 7yrs) she would always go balistic. I still live with my mum but i am now fixing up my new house to move out. My 'relationship' with my mum has got to an all time low, she actually hates me. I'm a good daughter i clean up after both of us, dishes clothes etc, i work as a primary school teacher and i have a realtionship with my bf of 7 years. Recently my mum doesn't even look at me, she walks in through the door and pretends i'm not even present. I have just suffered a terrible flu where i had to miss work and she refused to make me anything to eat or buy me any meds i had to go out with a fever of 40oc. This weekend though has been the worst she has told me that she doesn't love me or like me. She then started shouting at me saying she didn't want to have me but she did! she has lost it. I feel very alone i don't have a relationship with my dad and i just don't know what to do. I have tried talking to her but she closes her eyes and shouts these things i mentioned. What should i do? Do you think i should just forget about her completly when i move out? I feel so depressed i have found it hard to wake up in the mornings and have even had suicidal thoughts? thanks : )
