well i have this problem ever since i was a kid but its getting worse with age im 21 now. when i was little i used to be more active in my head as in i used to think alot about life fantacies or making plans etc n because of this i think im unable to read for more then few mins n its really hard to keep working on something without thinking about it or something n hearing my own voice in my head talking about the things im thinking and even when im in class or watching something on tv or even while driving n i get so involve in it that physically i pause n i pause n my auto pilot thing takes over n thn my body do its work on its own but it mostly just screw up coz thn i do things like i used to do it or how i mostly do it. n once we were in a class n i was trying to focus but in head i was planning on how to deal with that topic n how im gona work on it when i will get home etc n i kept going for like an hour n thn my teacher called out my name n said r u listening to me n i said yes! he thn told me to come to his table n asked me i know u get bored in my class right coz u think u dont need it n while he was talking i started thinking again n i didnt knw what he said to me he thn again said r u listening to me??? n i said yes n thn he said ok thn tell me what is the last thing i was talking to u about n i said u said r u listening to me n he said no b4 that n i didnt know what he was saying so i just stood there n thn he started saying that most of the students r physically here but there minds r somewhere else n thn i started thinking about something n again he said AHMED!!!! r u listening n i said yes! n thn he made a really bad face n told me to go n sit down :/ n its not like i dont try to focus on things i do try n sometimes i try so hard that i dont get the whole thing im reading or listening n because of that focus my head starts hurting so bad :/ n i do this while driving n in my auto pilot mode i kept driving n thn when i focus around me sometimes im way out of my route n i dont remember at that point that how did i get there n i do this while walking talking etc n its getting really bad :/ n once i came home n normally i go to my room put my things on my desk n lay down in my bed but i start thinking at that point n when i regained my sense i was in my car n i was backing my car n my clothes were changed n my cell n wallet were in my pocket n everything was in place except for i didnt want to go anywhere n i had no idea what was i doing there :/ so i went back to my room n i guess u guys get the main idea that how bad is this thing n this phase of thinking can b really long or short like from few seconds to mind to HOURS! n while im in this phase my basic instinct kick in n my body start to do work on auto pilot mode. n SOMETIMES while thinking about one thinking like may b working on some project n thinking about it n thn randomly i start thinking about something else n one thing lead to another n thn i forget that what i was thinking about in the first place n thn i retrace my steps n it takes a really long time mostly n thn when finally i figure out all of it thn i get back to my original work. im REALLY tired of this thing n idk if its coz of something or is it normal idk but i really wana get rid of it coz its getting bad! i have never told anyone this coz they will think im making this up or im a dumb person coz many characters in tv shows or movies do these kinda things but they r stupid n i know im not stupid coz my iq is really high so PLS if anyone know what is this n how can i fix it thn do tell me coz i wana do my work without this thing distracting me n i wana read like normal people. my head is just a mixture of an ocean of imagination n while writing this i got distracted by this thing atleast 6 7 times n sometimes i lost it that what i was gona write next LOL anyway im waiting for ur answers TC
 p.s i dont wana tell u guys this coz i dont want u to consider these things coz it could through u off but still im suffering from borderline personality disorder n clinical depression but pls also try to think of something without considering these 2 things bye
