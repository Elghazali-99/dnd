My father was aged 45 had been diagnosed with colon cancer in the sigmoid, he was operated where they removed about 13" of his colon and reconnected - biopsy resulted in dukes B and he received some months of chemo.  Now almost 5 years passed and my father is 49years now and he was diagnosed of reoccurance of cancer this time in the 60 and 65cm of his colon.  10 days ago the professor operated and he told us that they removed almost all the large intestine and joined side by side the small intestine with the last part of the large colon so that they didn't have the need to do the pouch.  After surgery he had the ng tube in his nose and he was on morphine and also the catheter (no drain done) and drip.  After 5 days of surgery he was doing fine, but on the 6th day the nurses removed his ng tube and told him he could drink sips and some luquid food.  But just after he started having gatorade, some sprite and jelly he started vomitting green to brown colour.  We called nurses and said thats normal after that type of surgery.  Again he took water and throw up, everytime he takes something even to drink he throws up this green vomit, he's been like this for almost 7 days without eating or drinking only drip.  They also tried to give him food substance drink like choclate yogurt but again he throws up.  Now they told us that he cannot have anything liquid or solid so as to give time his smotach to function.  Please let me know if they are right or is this normal cause i am very worried for my dad.  He also suffers from anxiety and depression.  The doctor said since he has no pain in the abdonimal it means that there isn't blockage.  He is also doing diarreha cause but doctors said thats normal cause now he has short intestines.  please let me know if all this is normal and why really is this green vomit.  thanks a lot
