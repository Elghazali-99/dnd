Hi I have a problem and I am hoping someone can tell me the best way I can address it.
 I faked hearing voices about 5 years ago so that I could get into supportive housing. I was on supervised meds and I was prescribing Zyprexa. Now that I've moved to a less supervised setting I wish to get off of it. The problem is that I can't stop taking it for even one night because I will not be able to sleep. Had I known the medication would have any risk of dependency at all I wouldn't have taken it.
 I have tryed 10mg  Zolpidem (Ambien) and it works great the first night but after that it just makes me dizzy and I get no rest by taking it unless I stop it for a few days. I got the pills from a physician by complaining to her about restlessness a couple of months ago.
 Well here are my two main questions:
 I am wondering if I can tell a physician that I would like to be taken off Zyprexa without being sent for a psychological evaluation of any sort and without seeming dishonest.
 And..
  I have heard that Lunesta has been approved for longer term use and maybe able to help out a person in my situation. Is this true or have I heard wrong?
 Any help will be greatly appreciated.
Thank You.
