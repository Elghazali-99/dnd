I am a 16 year old girl. I do not think I am depressed but my parents and the psychiatrist think I am. I hate going to the psychiatrist. They always ask me if I have ever hurt myself and i always tells then no. They ask me if i ever think about hurting or killing myself and i say no. I will never be able to tell them the truth about how I am always thinking about ways to kill myself (not that I'm going to ever do it). I have burned my arms and legs a few times with a curling iron which didn't really hurt because I don't feel pain too easily. I have found some broken pieces of glass and kept scratching my arm with it because I thought it was cool how the cuts were so small. I cry alot at night and I can't sleep. I have stomachaches and I have a bad appetite. Any suggestions out there so I can tell my parents and everyone else that I am perfectly fine? I do not think I am depressed I would just rather be left alone. But isn't this normal?? Well not the cutting and burning part, I do not know why I did that it just gave me something to do I guess.
