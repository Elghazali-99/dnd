INTRO: i've had this small spot of skin, (not just a bump but almost like a little flap hanging off), next to my scrotum for pretty much as long as i can remember. because i've had it so long i just ignore it, i used to want to pull it right off but it was to attached and cause to much pain for me to do so, so i left it.
 PROBLEM: i was just sitting down and i felt a sharp pain momentarily (almost like it was tugged at by something) which caused me to look at it. i haven't paid any attention to it in awhile but now it looks different, before it was just a hanging piece of skin but now it has a distinct spherical shape (so its larger than before) connected to me by a tiny thin piece of skin (it almost looks like the sphere is just sitting there)
 NOTES: it is small in size about the size of a grain of rice (except round) maybe slightly smaller. it is dirty pink in color. it is next to my scrotum maybe half an inch away(just as my thigh begins to form its in like the curvature between scrotum and thigh). like i said i've had a hanging piece of skin there as long as i can remember. it is not sensitive to touch, in fact touching, squeezing (lightly) and moving do not cause me to feel pain (not anything at all actually) however if i were to pull at it it would hurt cause its attached to me. Oh and im 18 years old (if that matters)
i'd also like to note ITS NOT ATTACHED TO SCROTUM (all caps so you see it and dont assume it is)
 THANK YOU: sorry if this was to wordy or confusing, i tried to give all the details i could because this is my first question. i dont wish to see a doctor if i can avoid it.
