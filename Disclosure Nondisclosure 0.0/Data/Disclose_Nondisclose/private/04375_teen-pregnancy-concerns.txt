I am 17 years old and I had my last period June 15th. My period lasts any time between 4-7 days but I'm not sure when it exactly ended that month. My boyfriend and I had sex on the 24th or 25th I'm not positive, but I remember it was like right after my period ended sometime give or take a day or two. He didn't ejaculate because he had to stop because his stomach hurt but when we looked at the condom we weren't sure if it broke because it looked wetter on the outside, like more than usual, something looked fishy and I got really scared so within 30 minutes of that happening, I took plan b. The next weekend, on June 30th and then July 1st, we had sex again, so like twice that weekend. He did not ejaculate, however if my calculations are correct that would be around the time my egg would be dropped. When we had sex this time, I noticed that around the condom there were little off-coloured almost like little pieces of brownish red. I assumed it was the plan b side effects of spotting so I dismissed it. Since then, I've been spotting a lot more, and it's been getting slightly heavier as the days have gone on. Sometimes it's brown and sometimes it's red or a mixture of both. I read online about implantation bleeding and I'm almost puking because I'm so scared that it could be that. the spotting isn't very heavy, but it's gotten heavier as the days have passed. I thought it was the side effects of plan b, but would they last this long? I'm so scared, I'm only 17. I know he didn't ejaculate but pre *** can get people pregnant too! or maybe we weren't careful enough or didn't put the condom on properly or something! I don't know I'm so scared it just seems like something is wrong. Since its July 10th and my last period was June 15th shouldn't my period come soon anyway? And I don't know when to count this spotting as my period or when to not? I'm so scared, I just wanted some advice or someone to tell me I'm overacting or if anyone else has had this or what.
