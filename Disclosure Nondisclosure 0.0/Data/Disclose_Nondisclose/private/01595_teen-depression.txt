The one place I have always been able to go to forget about bow much I hate myself and just forget about everything is youth group but on Thursday when I went I felt Sooo crappy. I just wanted to go sit alone I looked around me and looked for a quiet spot to sit but then relized I'm at youth and if I sit in another room alone people will ask questions so I just sat in between the couches and listened to the cinvorsation and watches people play ping pong. I didn't let anyone see how I was trulry feeling. 
 My qestion is though how much worse can this get??? For a month strait not a day went by that I did t think if ending it all. Since last week I haven't thought of it everyday but frequently. I almost tryed the other night I was about to grab the bag beside my bed but then my friend who is also depressed texted me so I just vented to her. I've already tryed 4 times a d almost 2 other times well almost 3 other times now I guess. But the first time I would if actualy gone threw with it but I didn't know what to do do. But I was like that's it I'm done!!!!
Anyways I am 16 and I don't want to waste my teen years hating myself and trying to kill myself I want to have fun and have a good time with out crashing after!!!! I have not seen see. A doctor and I'm not sure if I will I might. Though when I go to my friends on Friday she said shell take me to see a tharipist. Anyways how much worse cab this get and how fast do you think??? I know everyones different but it has to be somewhat similar!!! So what do you think. Also what can I do to get better and what should I expect from the therapist??? I probably won't see her alot just when I go to my friends!!!!
