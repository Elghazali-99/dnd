As of today, my period is two weeks late. Also, according to my PT, I am ovulating today, and before that, I last ovulated September 14th. My last day of my last period was September 3rd and my projected start date was September 28th. Right after the end of my last period, I started school again, and once a week 3hr long, rigorous exercise. I had to change my sleeping schedule (as I've heard that can effect periods, so i'm throwing it in here.) I  have had unprotected sex once-two times since my last period, however, he never finished, and it was only unprotected for about 3-5 minutes. Every other time, we have used a condom, and have checked for tears, and there have not been any. 
 I've been having some pretty intense mood swings, like I would before I get my period, but alas, nothing. Other than that, I have no other pregnancy symptoms - tenderness, back pain, cramping, urinating more often, nausea, etc. I do not have a single one of those symptoms. 
 Could, however, this missed period be a good indicator of pregnancy? I have not yet taken a test, because I figured I'm missing it due to the changes over the course of September, however 2 weeks in I am starting to worry. I used to get my periods in the middle of the month - around the 10th-14th, this was around April - July, and then starting in July, I got them right at the beginnings of the month (my July one was a week early). So, could it also just be an irregular cycle? 
 Regardless, I am still starting to worry a lot and would like some other opinions on this. Thank you.
