Dear Dr,
 I'm 21 years old and I've started to serously question how moral I am. I do things that I'm very ashamed of, and I wish I never did them. I've been masturbating for about 9 years, is this wrong? What's worse is that recently my fantasies are really disturbing me, I think about girls and anal sex, and that's something I would never do, but I feel like I'm a completeley different person when I'm aroused, and it makes me feel sick that I have such thoughts. I've never has sex before, has this something to do with it?
 Also, I've been sexually abused when I was younger twice, and my fantasies are starting to make me think that maybe I'm not so different, that if I can think about something I usually don't at that time, then how am I different? I've also been looking back at my past to see if I sexually abused anyone, I haven't. However, when I was like 9 or younger, I kissed a boy 3 years younger than me because I wanted to know how to kiss, is this sexual abuse, I hate myself for it?
 Also, I know that those who have been sexually abused often become the abusers, but I would never do that, and I feel soooo sick that that's a possibility. I just feel like I'm as sick as them, but then again I know I'm not, please help me Dr???
