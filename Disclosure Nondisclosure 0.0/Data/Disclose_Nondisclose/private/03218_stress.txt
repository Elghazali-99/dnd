Ever since about six months ago(I've been on and off of High Blood pressure medications for a year and a half now.  I have had bad reactions to almost all the meds, about 6 months ago i started to notice that my upper body would kind of sway and my hands would feel shaky and body would feel very achey.  I have been through every medical test imaginable and they just relate it to stress. I also have taken over a business, which of course is stressful but can't imagine it ever causing me to have core tremors and hand tremors.  Like i said the shakiness is almost like an internal tremor, nobody can see my hands shaking but I can feel it.  It's making me crazy!  Any information on how to help this problem that I'm having would be very much appreciated.  Had to mri scans done and both were perfectly Normal.  Could it Just really be stress???  Also when I'm out talking with people and doing simple errands i feel very self concsious of my internal shaking and it's a very weird feeling.  Before this happened 6-8 months ago i was an extremely confident person.  Like I said before, If anyone knows how to stop or lesson the internal shaking it would be greatly appreciated.  I'm currently on Clonidine System Patch, I have tried every other HBP Med and this seems to be the lessor of the evils.  when i'm on it i feel so tired and have week legs, and have constant Diariah.  I don't know if the internal Core Shaking is due to the meds or anxiety from what I've been through these past years.  My physchologist says that there was a point where my mind started to manifest the anxiety in physical symptoms.  When I'm on the Clonodine Patch my bp is 120/80-130/90.  If I'm not on any HBP med my BP is 160/110.  On the meds I have bad reactions and off the meds I have bad reactions.  It feel like a prison.  So I ask anyone that's out there? I have had almost every test in the book done, does this sound like stress and anxiety manifesting itself into physical symptoms?
