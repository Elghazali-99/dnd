Hello, I'm a 15 year old girl, I live in the Netherlands. My boyfriend lives in England and is 17. My boyfriend stayed over during easter, one thing led to another and we ' fooled around ' now, I don't mean sex but basically what happened was that he rubbed his penis against my vagina, it never actually entered my vagina and he said before he started rubbing he checked for precum on the tip. I'm not on the pill, he did not use a condom. About 38 hours after ' intercourse ' I took a morning after pill ( EllaOne ) 
 We had intercourse on the 27th of march. My last period was on the 24th of march and ended on the 29th of march.   ( meaning the intercourse happened while I was on my period ) I'm expecting my period tomorrow but read that multiple women took the morning after pill and had their periods almost a week later. My period is pretty irregular but I'm still fearing the worst as my parents aren't very supportive of abortion ( which was the first thing I thought about ) and my boyfriend lives all the way in England. He has been very supportive and sweet but obviously can't do much..
 Now, my questions are;
How big are the chances of me being pregnant ?
What is he best thing to do for now ?
How should I tell my parents ?
 Thanks for reading !
