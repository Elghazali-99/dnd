I began taking Effexor w/a 75mg dosage about 8 years ago and notices a dramatic improvement in  my everyday life.  My energy levels went up, I was tolerable of people/situations and able to retain friendships for the first time ever.  ALTHOUGH I have gradually began to put the pieces together and associate a LACK of 'being with it' over the last few years and desperately need help.  I used to waitress, but am now unable to wait on a slow night due to my not being there mentally.  It was frustrating, but I'm now FEARFUL because I'm entering a competitive 2 year spurt of clinicals and fear that I'll be unable to keep up, thus roughen my future!  I'm a single parent and am back in school for what has to be the last time (I'm 34) and need to figure out how to hone into my brain!  
 I'm am uninsured and would like some suggestions.  Is a lose of energy typical after so many years?  Would an increase in dosage or going off Effexor seem more logical?  Clinicals begin in January, so my times slowly ticking away.  
 Thanks so much in advance to any responses!
