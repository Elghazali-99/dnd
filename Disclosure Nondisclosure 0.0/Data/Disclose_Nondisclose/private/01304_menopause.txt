I am 25, married with two kids. Daughter 6, son 16m old and still nursing. I got the depo shot back in January or February. Before that my hormones were all jacked up and my periods we heavy and lasted 4 months. I had enough and went in to get checked out. Of course there number one solution is to try birth control. The gyno told me depo should help my dysfunctional uterine bleeding... however it made matters worst and I bled for two months with abdominal pain and clots the size of golf balls, terrible mood swings and the like. The shot ended in May and I didn't go back for the second. Since then, I am still not ovulating..wasn't before the shot and certainly not after. I had two periods in May. I skipped the month of June. In July I had 4 periods, with only a week break in between. Each lasted for two weeks long and were heavy and very watery. I bled twice in  August. And just had a period from August 30th to Sep 5th which was very heavy and watery. So far I have had no more bleeding this month....yet. on top of the frequent periods my other symptoms are insomnia, fatigue from lack of sleep, mood swings, irritability,vaginal dryness, dry skin, hair shedding, frequent bathroom trips and I'm not pregnant, NO sex drive whatsoever.....my moods and low libido are affecting my husband but he's being very understanding. I on the other hand am feeling miserable, and helpless and tired of being frustrated. I worry if I'm going through perimenopause. I'm experiencing all symptoms other than hot flashes or cold sweats....I know many would say at 25? It's unlikely...but though it's not common it does happen to few. I know of another lady about my age who was perimenopausal unexpectedly and planned on having kids in the future and now she can't. Of course I won't know for sure until I get some blood test done... please any advice, or similar symptoms or experinces....thanks!
