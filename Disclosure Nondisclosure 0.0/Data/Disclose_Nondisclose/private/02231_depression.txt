So my dp and depression has only gotten worse. I'm at a state of mind where i'm at the point of where am I, who am I, what am I, what do I do? Before I get more into this here is my back round. I'm a healthy 22 year old college male student. I don't do drugs, I eat healthy, no traumatic experiences, and I workout 4 times a week. I have been suffering from dp and depression for about four years and have taken citalopram(20mg) all four years. I also have therapy. Now, for the past year my brain has been getting worse and worse. I have a hard time feeling & showing emotions. There are times where my mind just goes dead blank for a while. My mind is constantly lost and not feeling real. I can't enjoy anything in life anymore because I feel like i'm just going to go brain dead. It as if I'm living in a black empty void and everything I see is blank. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. It's almost impossible for my brain to deal with school and I feel like my mind/brain is dying. I end up spending  a majority of my day siting in my room thinking of what the heck am I doing. I'm at the point where I think it's over for me. Nothing is helping and I'm only getting worse. If only I had the guts to end it. 
 sorry for the long post, I hope that anyone who reads this never has to go through this madness :(
