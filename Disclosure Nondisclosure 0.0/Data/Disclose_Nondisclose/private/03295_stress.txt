Hi,
 My 10 year old Daughter is being bullied at school, which we are dealing with alongside the school, but the problem seems to have gotten worse when my wife went for a walk with my daughter to the local shops. My daughter saw two teenage boys walking in front of them passing a knife between each other, they stopped meaning my wife and daughter had to walk past the boys, shortly after this the boys carried on walking to the same shops, but in my daughters mind she believed these boys where following her. The boys did infact go to the same shop and then walked the same direction when my wife and daughter walked back home, this seemed to intensift my daughters belief that these boys where infact following her, when in actual fact the boys live in the next street.
 It is now at the point where my daughter refuses to sleep in her own bed, refuses to be left alone in any room in the house and has even asked me to install a security alarm in the house and give her a panic alarm. Tonight she phoned me and asked me to come home from nightshift so she could sleep.
 I am at a loss what to do. Should I install an alarm on the house, when the house is perfectly save as it has brand new windows and doors fitted with the latest high tech locking systems, not to mention we have a large dog at home.
 A friend at work said I should try getting her a pet she can keep in her bedroom along with a nigh light and perhaps a panic alarm just to give her that extra sense of security.
 Any thought will be most appreciated.
