Thanks for your support!
 In the Fall of 2003 my wife informed she'd lightly flirted at our church and the man keeps coming into her mind, what should I do? I didn't make much of it. By Christmas she was hiring psychics to determine what "evil energies" were causing him to appear in her mind. (she would not accept responsibility).
 By 2005 this morphed into her believing "God was ridding Himself of sins by using this man to harass her". For two years she had been telling me he was hiring tantrics and voodoo people to intrude into her life and thoughts.
 In 2008 this became even more grandiose that her childhood Deity was personally harassing her and her family, raping our children, or allowing evil beings to rape them. If I asked her how come they had no memory of it, she said, "thier memories were erased".
 She claimed our mutual object of religious devotion had/was abusing me. She said my memory had been erased, but the Deity was responsible and she was furious at Him.
 What does this sound like? DD, or what?
 During 2009-2010 she claimed to be "working shoulder to shoulder with Jesus", that she was part of special group of people working to save the astral realm and gross realm from "Deities gone bad". If I attempt to counter her ideas she says her visions are above any spiritual leaders, and if any religious book goes against her thoughts, they are just ignorant. She knows what's what.
 This is scaring the dickens out of me. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I can't instutuionalize her as she is of no threat. She half considers me an enemy because I still carry on in the same religious faith we shared for 22 years.
 What is all this? How do I respond when she says something like, "your friend so and so is raping kids in the neighborhood in his astral body", or "your object of devotion is the devil, why do you do that?"
 etc....
 thanks,
 Doug
