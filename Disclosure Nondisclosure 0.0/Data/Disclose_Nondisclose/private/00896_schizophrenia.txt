Hey Guys i was wondering if anyone could help me? MY sister always been the shy nervous type but this last year is has come to the extreme and i just cant handle it on my own
 I'm the only one shr will talk to it about and she is now on anxiety medicine for about 3 weeks that dont seem to be doing nothing at all
 THis is what she goes through...She wakes up worrying about what people think of her. if people are tlaking about her behing her back, if she dropped something that she wouldnt want anyone to see ( and she will back track herself) 
SHe terrified of not being perfect and people thinking she is not perfect. SHE LKE NEEDS TO BE PERFECT
 she comes to me everyday with new anxiety and fears and it wasnt bad at all when we were younger but now i can see her pesonality changing and everything about her all focused around fears of not being perfect and people not like ing her24/7
 I drove her to talk today and she was telling em about all this stuff and needed an umbrella so i cgave her the one in my car and out of knnow where for no reason she was like wat if something bad was in the umbrella and fell in her purse and she did not at all want to take her purse in work cuz of a damn umbrella that has nothing wrong with it but i yalked her down made her sit and breather asn think of what she is saying and re evalute wat she is doing then she was fine
 On my way home a broke down crying ( and i dont cry like seriously it gtta to be something bad for me cry) and  ithink the worse thing in the world would be to lose my sister from fears and anxiety i just cant deal with it anymore i cant see my older sister go through all this and live like this we are only a year apart and she is my best friend...does anyone think this is skitzophrnia  ima post it i nthat forum too
 Also does anyone know what kind of therapist i should take her too? I'm looking for one i finally convinced her to trust one and that they wont tell anyone anything what she says but she will only go if i go with her for  a few sessions shes so scared to tell anyone what she tells me of obvoiusly the fear of not being perfect and people finding out. like she dont even want the therapist to take notes incase he would drop them  i dunno does anyone know what this sounds like i just want ehr to be able to LIVE her life
