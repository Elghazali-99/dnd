I am a 36 year old female. For the past 1 year and a half  I have endured debilitating muscle aches in my neck and shoulders as well as insomnia. My doctor found no clues in my blood tests except a vitamin D deficiency which was treated and is now okay. The aches are confusing because they change-sometime they are on the left shoulder and other times they are on the right. This is why I think they may be stress related. I have also had trouble sleeping and have at times stayed up all night-sometimes in tears because i don't know what to do. My doctor prescribed sleeping pills such as ambien but they stopped working after a while. Then she prescribed flexeril which has helped a bit but I wake up feeling very drowsy. I joined a gym and i do some yoga. it helps but not for long- the aches always come back. I have had some stress in my life but things are better now and I do not understand why the aches don't stop. Also the ache are very intense during the week before my period (PMS week)- I end up feeling so confused and frustrated that a few time suicide has crossed my mind. It is a hard pain to explain-almost like the nerves are raw and something is gnawing on them. When I don't sleep well, they intensify and when they intensify, I don't sleep. It is driving me insane and has even ruined my relationships. What could this be? please help.
