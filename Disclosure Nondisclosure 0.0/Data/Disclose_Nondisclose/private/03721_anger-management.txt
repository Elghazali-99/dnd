I have a 7 year old who has very bad temper tantrums (these started when she was about 5 years old) we do not spoil her and i usually send her to her room to calm down.  She will scream and shout and curse slam doors and sometimes throw things.  these episodes are usualy sparked off by her not getting her own way or when she is checked for bad behaviour,  I have a younger son who is 5 and she can be realy rude to him sometimes this realy bothers me as i dont want her to grow up like this it is making everyone in the house unhappy including her.  I feel like i am at the end of my rope, I have tried everything including (im ashamed to say smacking and shouting at her. ) has anyone got any advice ?  sometimes i think she might need to see someone professional but who? I feel so guilty because sometimes i feel like i realy dislike this little girl,  She can be a  realy lovley child and has such nice ways about her she is exceptionaly well behaved at school but with us she can be very difficult to manange.  I LOVE her very much but i am scared i am making a mess of raising her any advice would be really welcome.
  I am 8 months pregnant and am worried about how i will cope with these  tantrums when the new baby comes along
