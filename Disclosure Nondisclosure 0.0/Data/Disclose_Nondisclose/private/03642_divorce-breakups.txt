My daughter is 6 and is in counseling, because her father and I both feels like she has anger and behavior issues. I am not with her father. Her father and I has a conflictual relationship, which probably is one of the causes of her anger. I have done all in my power to get along with the father. The father has shown some alienating behaviors when it comes to my relationship with my daughter. The counselor she is seeing seems okay, but I feel very uncomfortable when I have to take my daughter to see her. I feel negative judgement from the counselor at times, because I have 2 other children by a different father. I feel like there are times when the counselor minimizes the father's behavior. The father has refused to sit and talk with me with the counselor. He refuses to do it without his girlfriend present. Many times, after I have had a conversation with the counselor, I feel uncomfortable. I am not sure what to do. I do not want to offend her and tell her this. At the same time, I do not want to stop sessions for my daughter at this time. I have surpressed my fellings for my daughter's needs. I am not sure what I should do. Any advice is welcomed.
