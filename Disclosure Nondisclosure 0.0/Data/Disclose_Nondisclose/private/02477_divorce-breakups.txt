So my wife and I have been together for 2 years and everything is going amazing. We have had our rough spots about children and my trust issues but were making it.until last night,
Side note the mother in law is a manipulative lazy *** and my wife feels the same way i do and though the get along cause there mother and daughter they have there tensions about it and because my wife's mother is so negative my wife doesn't like driving the 2 hours to go visit her mother.wifes choice not mine
About a week ago her parents and i went out with her to celebrate my wifes birthday and everything was going alright until i was not feeling well because of the food we ate and cause im a guy i toughed it out and was saying im fine. We went to see a movie and told my wife my stomach was upset and didnt want to get any snacks and being the concerned loving wife she is she expressed her concern alot and her mother over heard. i kept saying im fine really i'd just like some water my wife stopped asking and took my answer and we were fine but when we sat down for the movie we had a 20 min wait and the mother in law would not stop badgering me and i snapped i said im fine please just leave me alone about it, well she got butt hurt and walked off and came back right before the movie. now today 5 days later my wife wanted to go out and visit and get some school paper work filled out, and while there (this next part is what my wife told me about her visit) her mother started in about me saying that she's worried im abusive and that me snapping was not ok at all and that im as crazy as my mother(mother in law and my mom got into it a year ago) and she is really worried for my wife safety and saying that i dont let her do anything that she wants.. 
with this now i am not at sure what to do or how to handle this. i have never layed a hand on my wife nor have i ever been verablly abusive nor have i ever said she cant do something. Wife and I both and her co workers are always saying how great we are and its cute how to talk everything out and my wife does what ever she wants only concern i ever expressed about the things she does is my concern that her "gay" friend whom i thought had romantic feelings for her and i didnt want them to hang out alone as in they could go to public places and do what ever just didnt want them alone in my home or his which i think is understanding but any way. any suggstions would be great, im really worried about her mother saying those ****** lies about me to the wrong people and it causing problems for our relationship and me professionally sense i am in health care lies of that sort are not usually over looked.
