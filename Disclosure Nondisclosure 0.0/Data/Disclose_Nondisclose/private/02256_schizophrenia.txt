Hi. I was diagnosed with Bipolar I in my mid teens, about 4 years ago. At that time I had experienced 2 psychotic episodes associated with my mood changes, but it was just tagged as just being associated with the illness. My semi-new pdoc has switched me to the new Latuda, and has talked with me about Schizoaffective (Bipolar type) Disorder. He is not making an official diagnosis because (he says) more time is needed, although he's thought my previous diagnosis was not "on point" exactly before. My question is general, if anyone is comfortable sharing their experience or information/knowledge of Schizoaffective, I would appreciate hearing what some others deal with and experience. Also, if there are any key "personality" traits that you seem to find common among some of us, do share. And I know Latuda is fairly a new atyp antipsy, if anyone has experience with this medication, don't hesitate to share. I am a little wary about this one, for I had not even heard of it until a few days ago. (have not started yet, due to titration off another med) 
 Thanks!
