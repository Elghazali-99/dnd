Someone I know is worrying me. I would like to know if it could be BPD, so I would have a better perspective on this person (not being judgmental, just want to be aware) I used to be friends with this person but have had to call it a day. But I still encounter him sometimes, and his behaviour can upset me more than it should, I know. This is a list of the things he does:
Very inflated sense of his own self-importance. (unbelievable)
Arrogance and superciliousness.
When he's acting cold/mean/strange, always blames it on others. They are in the wrong, not him EVER.
Is now in a long term relationship, (which I know he is trying very hard to keep together because the fact that he couldn't hold down a relationship all of his life for very long without moving on to someone else, concerned him)
Lies with a totally straight face. You'd swear he was telling the truth if you didn't have evidence to the contrary.
Passes hard judgements on other people without even bothering to get to know them first. Is inclined to 'look down on' people.
Will fabricate/lie in order to make money, which he desires a lot of.
Yet, on the other side of him, is someone who CAN feel heartfelt things, and love. But he blows hot and cold in a very dramatic way, which causes a great deal of pain to some people who know him.
 Now I realize these are the symptoms of "a not very nice guy" not ONLY, or necessarily someone with BPD! I do hope I have not hurt or offended anyone with my question. But does any of this make any kind of sense with Borderline Personality?
 I know 'labeling' a person doesn't solve anything. But I need the perspective, because I never thought of this before, and it would explain a lot that has worried and hurt me very much over the years.
 The reason I'm asking is another friend of mine got hurt by him recently.
