Could anyone please give me some insight on the following?
 My BPD partner left me (for the first time) a couple of weeks ago, after a 1 year relationship and is sending out very mixed signals ever since. Yet he claims he wants to be alone and that we are definitely through. At the same time he offers me to accompany me to the cinema or to meet (but leaving the initiative to do so with me...) 
And he's taking every opporunity offered to see me - but he's not contacting me directly.
 Although I'm familiar with this mixed signal thing, it now leaves me very confused. The last conversation we had he was very uptight, like he was convincing himself that leaving me was best for h√≠m.
 I've read on another topic that people with BPD tend to come back after breaking up. But I've got some questions about this.
 Right now I just don't know what to do for the best.. leaving him alone like he asked me to or to stay in touch to let him know I still care? (and doesn't that cause backfire?)
 On this other topic someone said to leave them alone for a while, but not for too long. What's not too long?
(It's been about 6 days since we last talked and saw each other and we've kind of agreed to go to cinema next week - so he knows he'll see me then).
 Any answers are welcome...
 Laudy
