I've been on Zoloft 100mg a day for a little over 5 years and I was wondering if it is possible that it can stop working. In the past year my psychiatrist of 2 years moved and retired so I've been seeing a normal physician for my medication. He took me down to 100mg a day on my Topamax which seems to work well for my headaches but I notice still a couple times a month I become depressed. To my boyfriend, I tell him I'm "in a funk" when this happens and it has started to effect our relationship. We've been together for almost 9 months but he has brought up to me that he is concerned about me and how I act in my "funks" especially if we end up getting married.
 My "funk" tends to include feeling lethargic, avoiding going out, wanting to be alone or just with him, doing things such as cleaning to keep my mind busy, over-thinking and feeling anxious sometimes. 
 Is it possible my Zoloft has stopped being as effective? I realized that I get more depressed when I drink (which isn't that frequently) but now that I've made a note of it, I haven't had a drink since then. I just think I have an addictive personality and I'm very aware of myself and my actions. I feel like a robot. Any suggestions?
