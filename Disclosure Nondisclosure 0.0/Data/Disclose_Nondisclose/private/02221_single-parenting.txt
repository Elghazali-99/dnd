i was with the father of my child for 3 and a half years. he and i broke up in june this yr. our daughter is almost a yr old
now. he lives about 10 minutes away and has only seen k'dence about 4 times since july and has paid 30 dollars since july also. i have been wanting to move back to my home state of oklahoma for awhile now and think im wanting to do that before the end of the year. he swears up and down that he will not let me move away unless k'dence stays here with him. however, my family is in oklahoma and some very good opportunities are there for myself and my baby as well. i would love to have him in her life but not only at his convenience. i dont feel it is fair for she or i either one. someone told me that if he is not paying child support than he has no say and if i was to move that he would have to go to the state i move to and take me to court for visitations there. i really need some monetary support but if i can move to the place i really want to be than i will forego the child support in order to do that. does anyone know for sure if this is true. if not than i will go fill out papers for child support. thanks
