Hello.  I wanted to know if anyone is experiencing long withdrawal symptoms after taking Zoloft.  My max dose was 100 mg. which I took for one year.  I weined down very slowly under doctor supervision.  I have been off of the drug for about a week in a half.
 My symptoms / troubles are:
 Dizziness
Numbness and Tingling over my entire body (Almost feels like chills.)
Trouble concentrating
Cannot drive long distances
Unable to work (had to take a medical leave)
Tenderness on the scalp 
Vivid dreams
Extremely emotional, the slightest look from someone can make me sob
 I realize that my emotions are coming back, so I understand that aspect.  I just don't know how long this is supposed to last.  My doctor said after 3 days, Zoloft should be completely out of my system.  I've heard the withdrawal symptoms could last up to a month.  I guess I'm having trouble distinguishing between withdrawal symptoms or if my anxiety is back.
 I would appreciate anyone's input.  Thanks for reading.
