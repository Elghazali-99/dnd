My 14 year old daughter I just don't understand her no more, sometimes she seems's like a totally different person like I don't know her I need to know what it is thats in her mind or if she has any kind of disorder? If anybody comes up to her she will shout or scream and say GO AWAY!! LEAVE ME ALONE!!! and it's hard, she once said to me the aliens are comming so prepare when they do and her paraoria is way to extream she will avoid walking or going places where they are crowded I feel like she isolates herself, sometimes she says that she feels as so someone is touching her back a hand touching her back with pressure pushed on it or her legs sometimes I would hear her cry in her room I would go up to her but she will only tell me to leave her alone. I also notice she will looks around alot as so as someone is talking to her, she will hold a knife in her hand becausw she says she feels protected from them? I don't know what she means by “them“ she self harms I see the scars on her arm and wrist, when she hears something from someone or the news she feels she needs to investigate it, she says sometimes she feels she is in a dream like for some hours she will think I'm a evil soul and I work with the aliens and trying to kill her. Please give me an awnser.
