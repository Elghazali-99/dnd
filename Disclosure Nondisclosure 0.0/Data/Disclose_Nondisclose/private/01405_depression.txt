Around February this year I've suddenly lost interest in my everyday activities, and since then it's only been getting worse. I have a lot of exams, or had as half of them are done, but I still have like 11 left in the space of three weeks. Before the exams started and through the first half it wasn't nearly as bad as now. I'm angry for no reason and take it out on people, I sometimes feel like crying for no reason, the smallest things irritate me like babies crying, I just want to be left alone and not do anything at all. I can't be bothered to eat, socialise, even study, and when I do get around to doing something I usually get bored within 5 minutes. A few days ago I've also suddenly lost appetite and I've been forcing myself to eat but I still didn't eat a lot. I used to read at least one or two books per month, It was an activity I spent most of my time doing, now I don't do it at all and haven't done it even before the exams started. It's not because I don't have free time, because I do I just don't do anything with it. If I have a day off I spend most of it sleeping to kill time because I don't want to do anything. It hasn't gotten to the point of me having suicidal thoughts but sometimes I just think what is the point of everything in life, all these exams are pointless, what is the point of anything. I know there's only three weeks left and then it's all over but all I'm worrying about is passing those exams and how can I pass them if I can't even motivate myself to study for them or anything. Even when I do study, if I don't know something I just give up completely instead of trying to learn it or get someone to help me with it which is not something I'd usually do in this situation.
I don't know how I'm going to cope with all of this and I don't know if there is anything to make the next three weeks at least slightly bearable, but at the minute I don't see any other option than just somehow surviving it.
