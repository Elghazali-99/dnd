Hey everyone, I'm new to these forums or this community and I'm not entirely sure how many people have asked about this or have had this issue.  Tonight, I got extremely mad at my sister and my mom for assuming I stay on the computer till 1 or 2am "every night".  I know, not a big deal at all but it triggered me and I blew up. I was yelling at my sister to "stfu and stop assuming sh*t". And after that I stormed off into the bathroom and punched myself in the face, harder than I have before (yes it's happened many times before). And I sat down on the tub trying to cool down and figure out why I even blew up so bad in the first place and I began to think that I was insane and I needed to be locked up in some asylum or that I needed to be completely alone so I wouldn't hurt anyone. After about 15 minutes of deep breathing, a fast heart rate, and freaking out about how I'm some kind of monster, I went to my bed and just cried about how scary I must've been.  I'm honestly afraid of myself at times and tonight was by far the most scared I've been.
I'm mostly wondering about what I can do to better myself and how I manage my anger besides seeing a professional as I most likely can't afford it and neither can my family. Or even just experiences or advice or anything at all. Sorry to make it such a long post, I just wanted to really give you guys an insight to what I'm dealing with and what I need help with. I know I need some kind of help and I'm hoping I can get help from any of you to help myself and hopefully later help others with anger management
