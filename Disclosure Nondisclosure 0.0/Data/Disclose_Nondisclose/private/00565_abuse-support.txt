So for those of you that have read my previous post about my bf and his mom's behavior towards him, I gathered that about half of you think it is odd, and half of you think its just overprotective parenting type of thing. (If you havent read it, it's a long story to repeat, please read "I think my bf may have been sexually abused as a kid..and won't tell me). But anyways, the newest thing that I learned is this.. at his mom's, when we go there together, we sleep in her bed and she sleeps on the couch (there is no guest room or anything). But I found out last night that when he goes up there by himself, that him and his mom share her bed..? The bed is big enough for 2 people but barely, (smaller than a queen). Again, he is 25 years old. Doesn't that just seem odd?? I know I sure as hell would not sleep in bed with my mom for a weekend or so at a time..that is just weird to me!! Do other families do stuff like this??? I have tried talking to my dad, my aunt and her friend about it (all in separate places at different times) and they all think it is a bit odd. Again, I might be overreacting, but that's what I'm trying to figure out, because to me and both sides of my family, this is not normal. (ps, if you have not read my original post, please don't base an opinion off of just this one because there is more to it. Thanks.)
