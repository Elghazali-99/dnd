Hi.i was diagnosed 3years ago with clinical depression.i m 21.5 yrs old.my mother is bipolar and a couple of relatives on both maternal and paternal side have some sort of mental disability.i've been doing good but the trouble is that every year in last three i get depressed around march and after rigoroous therapy and medication i steadily improve....only to get depressed again next year.now i feel absolutely ok but m positively terrified that i'll be back to square a by march.
There's one more thing.in march/ april i get....kind of...brief episodes... Its tough to explain but lemme try... It begins with my attention drifting away from main event happening at that time to minor things like someone dragging chair etc.then absolutely unimportant things make me feel pain, i mean, who feels pain by seeing dust on leaves?or the way sunlight falls on plants?then it begins, rapid, very rapid sequence of thoughts. Nothing significant, just parts of phrases,voices and what i dont get is that it causes me really really intense pain.i want to run away, to scream, to get over with it. Can somebody tell me what should i do? Why this happens? How to prevent it or handle it?
