Ive been switched from Paroxetine to Zoloft as am looking to try for a baby and this is supposed to be 'safer'. My doctor has changed me over gradually.  I took Paroxetine 20mg for 2 weeks plus Sertraline/Zoloft 50mg, then went to Paroxetine 10mg and Sertraline/Zoloft 50mg and 5 days ago I've stopped Paroxetine altogether and am now just on Zoloft 50mg...I've went to the doctors yesterday because I feel terrible terrible - headaches, feeling incredibly depressed and crazy! I feel like I don't even know who I am anymore.  The doctor said it should pass in a few weeks but ive Googled paxil withdrawal which has terrified me as people have said either it takes months to feel normal again or they never feel better! Im so scared....I don't want to feel like this forever. ..should I just go back on it? 
 I would have thought being on the Zoloft would have heloed with withdrawal effects but it doesn't seem to have!
 How long does it take for Zoloft to kick in? I have been on it for 5 weeks now. ..shouldn't I be feeling better by now? 
 Am so depressed as I really want to try for a baby and I know I cant be on Paroxetine so scared ill be like this throughout my entire pregnancy when I want to be happy and enjoy this time.   
 In an ideal world I don't want to be on any meds but I have such bad depression and anxiety that its not an option for me...feeling annoyed that the Paroxetine worked well and now I can't be on it anymore!!
 Please help me x
