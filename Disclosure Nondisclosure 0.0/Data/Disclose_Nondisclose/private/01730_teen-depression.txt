Ok so I'm a 13 year old girl and I feel depressed
Here's my story: so I just started a new school last year and I still have no friends. I have a boyfriend but his friends always bully me and he does too just to look cool in front of his friends. Pretty much my whole class bully's me. Mostly the guys. It started around the middle of the year when my friend was on my iPod. I guess she guessed the password and was on my personal Instagram where I can express my depression and things like that with nobody knowing its me. Well I didn't know until the next day and she told everyone about it and everyone was calling me depressed girl. Even the people who I thought were my friends. Then the " popular girls " in my class were pretty much bugging me and saying stuff like " we found your Instagram " and making mean jokes like that. And now I am DREADING going back to school because those jokes will come right back and I'm going to be sitting by myself at lunch and ressess like I always did last year and I really don't want to go back. I just want my old friends from my old school where none of these hurtful comments and names existed. Because of them I've started self harming and feel suicidal almost everyday. ( not as much now since school is out but still do ) somebody please help me... What can I do?
