Hello all,
 Thank you for taking the time to read this, it is my first post on MedHelp. I'm a 22 year old male, I graduated with a Bachelors of Science last May. These next two years I am pursuing my masters degree, and then I will be finally done with college!!! WOOHOO! I have suffered from depression since I was about 12 years old. From the ages 19-21 I think I was on and off every anti-depressant/anxiety pill offered. NONE of them worked for me. (Prozac, EffexorXR, Wellbutrin, Xanax, Zoloft etc.) After all of those UPs and downs, losing weight, gaining weight, withdrawal symptoms, feeling like a zombie... I said, ENOUGH!! I got off all of those pills cold turkey. I threw them away, and didn't take one again. It was brutal... yes.. but I feel 100% better being off of them now. 
 From then, I still wanted to tackle my depression. I still felt like it was consuming my life, and there had to be a way to get around it. 
 I was referred to a different doctor, and this particular doctor prescribed me Adderall. I knew I heard of it from being in college, but never tried it. Being that I was in a mental-state of severely depressed, I thought I should just give it a shot. It worked out GREAT, for the first time I think I actually felt "normal." I could actually get out of bed during the day. I wanted to talk to people. My interest in school went up immensely etc. etc.. 
 With all that being said... Are there other people out there that are prescribed Adderall for depression? Also how many MG do you take? I am curious to see if I'm prescribed a "normal" amount. I currently take 2, 30mg Adderall XR daily (morning, afternoon) and 1, 10mg Instant Release Adderall around 7:00pm. 70mgs of Adderall total a day.
