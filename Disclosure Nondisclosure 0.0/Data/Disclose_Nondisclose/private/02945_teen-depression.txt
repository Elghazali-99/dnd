I'm 18 years old, a senior in high school and i have a 2.3 gpa at the moment. My whole life mainly since the 8th grade, my grades haven't been too well. Everyday my dad brings up the past and my grades, i try hard in school but it seems like when it comes to tests, i will forget what i learned quickly. My dad also always brings up how i'm not responsible, i dont deserve this i dont deserve that etc... We argue almost everyday cause he will get mad at the most littlest things. A year ago my friends introduced me to marijuana and i've loved it ever since cause it gets me away from all this reality. However everyday i feel like a failure to my dad and my younger brother, like i'm not good enough. He yells at me in front of him and sometimes i wonder if he thinks im a failure too. Its really hard to open up. I can only really open up to my mom but she doesnt live with me so its rare or online. I get really depressed and just hide it. I think this is the reason why i never had a girlfriend, cause i'm so conscious about myself. If i don't get into a university with an scholarship that requires a 3.5 gpa, then i'm not going to college because both my parents don't have enough money since they're divorced and other stuff. I really need help! I honestly can't take it anymore!
