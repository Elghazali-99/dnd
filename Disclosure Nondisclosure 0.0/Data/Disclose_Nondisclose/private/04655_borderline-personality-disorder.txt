Two years ago I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, and as time went with it I was found to have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as well. As most people on medications for mental illnessed do, I quit taking mine through the two year period and in that time resolved little issues. I never took therapy although I should have but listened to people say "Buck up and quit complaining." or something along those lines. In recent time I became married moved to Texas from Chicagoland and began SSRI Celexa in which I began becoming physically ill, irritable in which I was told that was normal. Six months later I became violent toward my wife who has Lyme disease I drug her around a room then when she hid from me crying I slapped her and to this day I don't know how it all happened or why I would do that. I had never been abusive before to anyone in my life. I was kicked out by my wife and when I came back to Indiana I started getting help again this time choosing to see a psychotherapist although I'm still on hold for it because they say it a "Process". But to get to my question, Can Narcissistic Personality Disorder be confused with Bi-Polar Disorder? And could it be because I may have a personality disorder more so than bi-polar disorder that I become physically ill? Right now I'm on Depekote 1000mg' a day which leave me with dry skin and rashes, the feeling of constant anxiety and it makes me physically ill as well. Someone please don't give me a cop out answer like "Don't worry about your diagnosis worry about the medication." it's been pretty obvious that medication is not helping me, it's making me sick. So any Doctor that know's please respond.
