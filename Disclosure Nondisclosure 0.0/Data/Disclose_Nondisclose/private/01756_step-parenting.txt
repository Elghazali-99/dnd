2 years ago I met a wonderful man who has a daughter at the time she was 3 years old.  I am divorced and have two teenagers (18 and 17).  His daughter and I got along so well, she used to kiss me, hug me and say I love you.  It was great.. It all changed about 9 months ago, she is now distant, she doesn't hug or say hi to me when she comes over. (her father and I become engaged a year and half ago and he has been living with me and my children since we became engaged).  I say hi about four times before she does (she is now 5), she doesn't want to be around me.  It has been killing me and now I have a wall up.  It is a huge strain on my soon to be husband and I relationship.  I love him but I can't handle this.  He doesn't do anything to find out what is wrong. Her mother is another story. I am not sure if there is something she is saying to her daughter.  (her mother had someone follow me and my soon to be husband).  Every time she is here I want to leave, I don't feel comfortable in my own house.  I feel like ending our relationship.  Help I cry every time she is here. (she is distant with my children 2).
