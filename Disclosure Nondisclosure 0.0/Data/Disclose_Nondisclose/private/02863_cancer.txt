Hi, I'm a 28 year old male and my issue started about 3 weeks ago when I had an episode of blood in my ejaculate. The ejaculate was a slight pink. Two more episodes of ejaculate were a bright pink and a final episode before the visit to the Dr was mostly blood.I also had an episode of slight blood in my urine after straining with a stool. The blood was slight and came out at the very end of my BM. The night before the first episode I had intercourse with my girlfriend, although I wouldn't say it was rough.The Dr analyzed my urine for bleeding or infection, and he also used a dipstick...both tests came back negative. I started a script of doxycycline 100mg, 2 times a day and the bleeding stopped. A week later I visited the Dr again, worried about a slight ache in my sacrum and right hip...a very small area of the hip. The pain doesn't hurt when I am mobile, but seems to ache at night. At the moment I am lying down and I can't feel it, so some part of me believes I may be anxious and causing the pain. My question is, does this sound serious? Would cancer related bleeding from the prostate/tumors stop with antibiotics? Does the pain sound serious? It is more of a mild convenience, and hasn't progressed much in 3 weeks. Thank you.
