Hi Doctor,
 My sister is in a strange situation.  She met someone 3 years ago, met online, we live in Canada, and he lived in the States.  They met, and hit it off, a year later, they got married.  Since then he has been extremely insecure.  He really thinks that she is cheating, and always has been, which she definitly is not.  He has got to the point where he writes what she is wearing daily, what time she goes to work, leaves the house.  He went to her work and checked her work emails, since he could not find proof at their home email.  He even says that he sees the "boyfriend" at the corner, and they wave to each other.  When I approached him about it, he gave me all these details on how he knows, he said that she had a bruise on her chest from "rough sex" with her "boyfriend", pimples on her cheeks from kissing her "boyfriend".  
 She made the choice to leave him, but because he is from the states, and his papers have not gone through yet, he will get deported, and none of us want this, as he has no friends or family.  We are afraid that he will hurt himself, or become a bum on the streets.
 What should my sister do, she loves him to death, but can't live like that.
