I am a 14 year old girl. I sometimes get worked up over the most stupidest things. At times, I get angry and feel the need to hit something. Other times, I feel like breaking down and losing it. I am quiet in class and people judge me which brings me down even more. Whenever I'm depressed I usually start to reach for the food which makes my eating habits screw up. It's hard to control. If someone had come up to me and said the wrong thing while I was in a angry mood, I would more than likely hit them in some kind of way without realizing that I did it. I'm not sure what to do anymore about these problems I'm having. I sometimes get thoughts of horrible deaths or suicide. I want to get along easily. I think I'm starting to lose it with my boyfriend, I usually get into a lot of fights with him. Even my friends seem to be slowly backing away from me. I really need some help getting them back and controlling these problems. I've already chosen a future for myself and I'm afraid these kinds of problems could easily push that out of the way if I had lost it with my mother, and sent to a home. It has happened before. The police officer threatened me but still the uncontrollable behavior has come back over and over again.
