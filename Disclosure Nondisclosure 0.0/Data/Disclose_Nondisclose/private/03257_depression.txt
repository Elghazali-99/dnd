Hello Forum. 
I'm currently in a relationship with a girl that I truely love. The thing is, that she is almost 18 and suffering from a depression and she as many of you would guess, is having a hard time of her life. 
She have been taking getting meds and gotten professional help against it for alittle more than a moth. 
 But here comes the problem. Now that she has gotten depressed, she is having a hard time "loving me", and having the "right feelings" for me which makes her really sad, because she thinks i'm perfect for her. She have thoughts, that it might be best to break up for her own best, and because she thinks that she is wasting my time, but as soon as we are together and enjoying eachother, she realises that she don't want to be without me. (though she doesn't love me)
The psychologist advices her to break up with me (which is why she have been having thoughts about it), because she believes that she needs to focus on herself only, and i think that it is somewhat true. She is using to much energi on thinking about this relationship instead of just enjoying it. I know that you can't love anyone until you learn to love yourself.
 I'm just relatively sure, that if we break up, she will get ALOT worse, because then she will be completely alone. And 100% will she miss me.
She have got only 1 good friend, but they only hang out in school. So she will be alone each day if we break up.
 So my question is forum. Shall i break up with her, now that she can't, though it might be best for her? and hope that it will actually help, and hope to togehter with her when she gets better. 
Or shall i do what i believe is right, and stay with her and do what i can to help her, now that she needs me the most?
