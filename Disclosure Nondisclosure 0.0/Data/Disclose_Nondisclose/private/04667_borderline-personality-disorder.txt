i have a client who's daughter is 29yrs old this girl has had some traits over her childhood and adult years which include lying, insecurity in relationships, fear of rejection, inability to sustain friendships and relationships, she is intelligent but likes to be seen as excellent at what she does and often puts others down, she manipulates situations and is always striving to be important to others. She likes to be listened to often exaggerating situations to make herself look better, she has once pretended to take an overdose when a relationship wasnt going well, and didnt care that her family were put through this anguish, when she initially was taken to hospital she refused to allow a blood test and became angry and abusive, which happens very quickly and anger and volatility is one of her main problems reading things wrongly but believing that how she sees things are the right way. she made threats of leaving home to make others feel guilty when she was younger. she is very manipulative and jealous of her sister and will often call others to make herself look better and be a victim wanting others to feel sorry for her. she now has a baby 2yrs old and relishes the fact that he will only be comforted by her and his attachment is often seen by her as to elevate her importance as compared to his attachment with others.constantly telling people that he is a mummys boy and elevating her importance to him.
do you think these are the traits of personality disorder, and if so whiat is the best way to get her some help when she is so difficult to approach ?
