I've been taking about 30 or so mg off adderal for about the past 7 months almost daily, got kind of tolerant to it wen taking it almost every day then once i quit my job i started taking it less, then my tolerance went down, but now i need it for school so I'm back to about 30 mg a day. I currently got diagnosed with ADD, moderate anxiety and depression. My dr. put me on lexipro 10mg to start out, I also got prescribed 1mg of xanax and ran out in about two weeks because I have such a high tolerance to it,and 10 mg of ambient. My dr. told me to switch off between the two for my insomnia. I found myself wanting to take the xanax everyday after my adderal was wearing off and just needed to relax which does help when i take enough. I am very fidgety all the time and can never seem to relax very tense. The next time i met with my dr. she moved my lexipro to 20 mg, and my xanax to 2mg. I don't really feel a difference in the lexipro anymore I felt it 4 days after i started taking the 10 mg and was feeling really social but now I'm not feeling it so much. So now its been a little over a week after getting my 2mg xanax prescription and now i am almost out. I don't know if that means my tolerance is just too high combined with all the meds am i taking I just need something to calm me down. I also have a lot of stress in my life in the moment and the xanax really helps i just don't know if my dr will keep prescribing it to me i am also seeing a therapist but i would just like some feed back on my situation. (also at the moment dealing with moving to a new apt, unpacking, money issues, school work to keep up one, and having to find a job) I feel i am not ready for a job yet but i have no choice i need the money so I'm hoping to get some pills that will help me in the mean time. I am also going to therapy so that should be helping as well
