My husband is generally a wonderful person.  He is kind, and gentle.  he's loving and funny.  he is a great father, he clearly love me and loves our 2 year old daughter.  He is in business with his father, and doesn't have the greatest relationship with his dad.  Much of his anger stems from seeking approval from his father, and never receiving it.  Several times a month, he has MAJOR outbursts at work, directed at his father.  Most recently, he told his father to "Get the F#@* out and F#*& off!" after disagreeing about how to fix a part that came in.  Which brings me to my next big issue - his language.  He swears CONSTANTLY.  He uses the F word in regular conversation.  He was in the Navy for 4 years, and that's where it got really bad.  We've talked about it before, and he always says he will try not to swear so much, but I dont see much effort.  After the most recent incident at work, we had a HUGE fight about what happened and how he handled it.  He broke down sobbing, screaming, felt like he had no support from me, etc.  He has never hit me, and I have never been afraid of him or felt threatened that he would turn violent toward me.  But I am concerned for his mental health and the health of our marriage.  He agrees to see a counselor with me, and we are attending our first session today.  Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can do day-to-day to get through the day?  How do you sleep next to someone at night when you just had that level of an argument?  How do you get through the day to day routine without becoming consumed by anger yourself?
