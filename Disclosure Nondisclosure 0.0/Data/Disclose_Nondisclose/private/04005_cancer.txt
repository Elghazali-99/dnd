I've been having some symptoms for over half a year now, and I'm very concerned about what all of this might be. I don't know whether all of this is related to each other or not. I've been getting medical assistance and I'll do a colonoscopy and endoscopy soon. 
 I'm a 23 y/o male. I have a healthy lifestyle, eat well, don't smoke/drink, do exercise, etc. There is no history in my family for similar diseases. The only thing that may come to mind is Helicobacter Pyori, that my mother had and recently appeared to get rid of.
 So let's start:
 - My abdomen seems swollen, and has been so for a while. It is the left side, near the belly button, that is swollen.
- Random, sudden and unexpected red flushing of the skin in random points of the chest and abdomen. It might be small spots here and there, or it might be an entire area that is flushed. There are periods when it is more visible than others. Sometimes, it comes with pain in that area. Not itching. Pain. Mild, but still painful. I can't really describe the pain, but it feels like it comes from underneath de skin. It gets normal colored when I press that spot, and gets flushed again if I stop pressing. Sometimes, pressure aggravates the flushing.
- Random, sudden, unexpected and short pains (more or less like pins and needles) and feeling of disconfort across some parts of the body. Sometimes along the abdomen, sometimes in my head. The description of ice-pick headaches seem to fit it, but not sure. Sometimes it is like I get this pain that seems to follow an (imaginary or not) nerve from the neck to the back of my head, or sometimes at the sides. It is usually very sudden, although sometimes the same spot gets shorts episodes of it over a period of time, like, say, half an hour. Once, I got such a feeling and each time it reappeared, it seemed to get more mild. Then another day it's like it's another point that gets it.
- Random, sudden, unexpected and short muscle spasms. Places seem vastly different from each other, like: buttocks, knees, abdomen, back, leg, etc. It doesn't stay on one place for long. Just comes and goes instantly. 
- Diarrhea. Not every day, but some days. Then other days light colored stools. Normal other days.
- A few days ago, had heartburn that lasted for almost a week. Might had something to do with things I ate. I don't usually have it.
- Often, It doesn't take me a long time after starting eating to feel full. I don't know exactly if it's nausea or not, but I feel like eating more would make me feel bad. 
- Bloating. There were some antibiotics that seemed to help. Nowadays I feel better in that aspect.
- Loss of weight. Not really sure of it, as I don't measure it often, but I think I was at the very least 70kgs a while ago, and now I have 65kg. 
 Obs:
- I'm an anxious person, and I had a panic attack almost an year ago. I don't know whether some of my symptoms now are due to that, or due to something else. But I'm not gonna blame it. Instead, I'd like to rule out more serious conditions.
 I think that's it. Please, if someone can help shed some light on this, I'd appreciate it immensly.
