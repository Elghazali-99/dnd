Over the course of my life I have always been a pretty tame person but as of the last year or so I have turned into the complete opposite. I find it impossible to relax myself at times, few things seem to have the potential of calming me down. 
Last year, out of pure coincidence, I happened to come across a man in the supermarket who happened to by my "father" - a man I havent seen since I was five. I tried to approach him and he ignored me.....Basically ran the other way - And he knew who I was. Not long after I looked him up in the phone book, went to his house where he answered the door and he slammed it in my face. I lost my cool and forced my fist through his front window, stomped on his doorstep, punched his varanda walls - I basically went nuts - Something I had never been before.
Ever since this moment I have been violent towards most people in my life. My gf has left me with an ultimatum of getting help or losing her- I never hit her directly but I do throw furniture around. 
Towards my friends I also now lose my cool all too frequently. Even with strangers I am being arrogant, rude and uncivil. The other day while waiting in line at a petrol station, the cashier gave me less than flattering look so I knocked over the cd stand and smacked my fist on the counter. This is psychotic behaviour!
Another thing that I do everyday is drive past my fathers house both too and from work....If I see him out of his house I swear I will hurt him.
I do not know what I've become - I fear this behaviour will only escalate - How do I work on these problems and become what I once was? Is it possible?
