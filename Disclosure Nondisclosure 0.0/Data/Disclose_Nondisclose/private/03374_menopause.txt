I have found only a few posts here about other women having actual upside down uteruses and their effects.  I recently had an ultrasound because I started to bleed after a year menopause and had severe lower back pain.  The doctor did a pelvic and felt a large mass.  Well... the ultrasound came back perfectly normal, only it was very apparent that my uterus has turned completely upside down!  It was the uterus that the doc felt.  On today's exam, the doc almost could not get to the cervix for a pap sample due to it being way up toward my belly button!  Of course we all laughed about it.. what else can you do!  I have always known I had a tilted uterus.  My question is, has anyone else with a tilted uterus found out that as they get older and go through menopause, that their uteruses become even more turned?  And what kind of symptoms does it cause?  I think it is pressing on my colon, unfortunately, giving me digestive problems.  And the added back pain during my unusual menstrual cycle.  Are there any exercises that would turn it back even a little bit?
