I'm not self-diagnosing, I am just confused/worried that BPD may be a strong possibility. I've never talked to anyone about my concerns, I'm currently seeing a therapist for self harm, depression, and a dysfunctional home life, but I wouldn't even know how to bring up some of my concerns as I am incapable of describing my feelings accurately to others (especially in person). I have taken some online screening tests (just to see how I would score) and every single one I have taken has said that it is a strong possibility and that it would be advisable and likely beneficial for me to seek a further evaluation. I take them every so often to see if my score has changed, that maybe I was just having a stressful week that was causing me to behave differently (I don't handle stress well at all), but it hasn't. If anything, the symptoms I have have gotten worse. At first I just thought I had clinical depression (which my therapist has already determined is true), but then I found out about BPD. When I was first reading the symptoms I couldn't believe it. Every single one described me right to to a t. It was like reading a book written about me... The unstable sense of self, inappropriate and uncontrollable anger, mood swings, chronic feelings of emptiness, fear of abandonment, compulsive self-harm, substance abuse, ect. I had them all. Another thing is that they say that certain personality types are prone to developing eating disorders, and that borderline is one of them. I think I may have an eating disorder as well, but I'm not going to get into those symptoms on this post. What should I do? I really want to get tested so I can stop worrying about it, but I don't know how to tell my mom that. I've been trying to drop hints about certain symptoms to my therapist, but have been unsuccessful. Help!
