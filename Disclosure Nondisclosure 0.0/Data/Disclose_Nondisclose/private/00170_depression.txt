I do not feel myself. I manage to get things done, but i feel like the day to day necessities are just too much to handle, laundry, cleaning, pretty much anything outside of going to work. I have no energy & will sleep as long as my husband lets me on the weekends. I feel like im depriving my child of a fun mommy to play with. I feel terrible because i have nothing to be depressed about. I have a good husband, child, family, a job, house, etc. I also think I had undiagnosed post partum depression which i never let anyone know about because i was ashamed. I did eventually feel better. I just have no motivation. I didnt even realize i could be depressed until i started taking a drug called tramadol for pain. I used it a few times a week & noticed i felt much better with more energy and less mood swings. Come to find out this drug actually increases seratonin levels which would explain my elevated mood. Now I'm wondering if I should try St. John's wort or see a psychiatrist for an antidepressant. Any ideas?
