Hi,
 I have been diagnosed with borderline personality structure / disorder very recently although supposedly I have had it for years.  I'm very confused about it.  As far as I can remember, I have not been sexually abused.  I'm turning myself inside out trying to work out how and why I developed this.  I'm trying to work out if I have repressed the memory of being sexually abused.  But I don't know if this is because I'm getting a bit psychotic at the moment.  Apart from sexual abuse, what else causes BPD?  A doctor told me that I could have it because I was bullied at school and my parents didn't validate my feelings growing up.  These seem like pretty insignificant things to cause such a debilitating problem.  I can't quite believe him.  I had some traumatic experiences with an ex-boyfriend of mine committing suicide because I broke up with him but this wasn't till I was 17, and I thought to get BPD you had to have trauma at a very early age.
Could the fact that I have bp structure rather than bp disorder be why the cause is a bit milder than full on abuse?  What is the difference between borderline personality structure and borderline personality disorder?  Another doctor told me the difference is negligible.
I have looked at the DSM criteria for BPD and as far as I can tell I have all of the symptoms.
 Please help.
