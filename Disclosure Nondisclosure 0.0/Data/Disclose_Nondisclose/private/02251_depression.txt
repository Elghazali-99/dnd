For the past 18 months I have been taking 1000mg of Epilim for my epilepsy and 30mg Avanza and 100mg Prestique for depression. The trouble is I don't know if it is because I am just depressed or bi polar or it has something to do with the tonic clonic seizures I have. My concentration and memory is zero. What is worrying me now is that I now am consumed with suicidal thoughts and in what I call "The Pit" where I get when my depression is at its worst and self harming. My recent paranoid and anxious behaviour has made everyone including my children disassociate from me and I was forced to give up my 12 yo son to child services due to I could not look after him as he has criminal and abusive behaviour. This alone lost me many friends and family. I only have my fiance whom none of my family like. I am alone and so scared, and I cant see my doctor as I have seen 3 in 2 months and they say just see a psychiatrist.I am 42 and was told I was also displaying menopausal symptoms I don't know what to do. I cant take this pain any more.
