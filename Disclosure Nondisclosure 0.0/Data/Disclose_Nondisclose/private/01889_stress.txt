Has anyone ever taken the Medication Vyvanse? It is prescribed for ADHD. I'm on a 50 mg dosage, and I have been taking it for about 3 months or so and have developed strange habits. I looked up the side-effects but none of them are relevant to what I am experiencing. I have trouble falling asleep at night. The reason for that is when I am in the bathroom or my bedroom getting changed, I look at my whole body. I analyze every inch, and I find small ingrown hairs or bumps on my arms, legs, back, face, chest, and stomach. I'm not a big fan of things being on my body that aren't really supposed to be there, so I try to get rid of them. Unfortunately I end up spending up to 6 hours ripping apart my skin, and by the time I'm done, my body is a mess. I've had this lump on the back of my thigh for a few months now, turns out it was a severely ingrown hair. I grabbed tweezers and started ripping my skin open until I got the hair out. I now have a hole in my leg that is about the size of a pen tip. I realize that this is not good to do, but I just can't seem to get myself to stop. I have scars from doing this and it really upsets me that I keep doing it. I WANT to stop, but for some reason I just can't. It upsets me to the point where I am crying. I've asked for answers or help, and received nothing. I'm assuming that is because no one seems to understand. I've thought about the option of stopping the use of this medication, and I have tried doing that. While I wasn't taking it I didn't have a problem with my body. I lasted about a week and I became very violent. I had zero patience for anything, and freaked out over the smallest things. It scared me that I couldn't control myself, so I started taking the Vyvanse again. I'm much more calmer, I have a higher tolerance level, and thankfully, I'm more cordial. The downside is I'm back to my routine of spending hours in the bathroom.
