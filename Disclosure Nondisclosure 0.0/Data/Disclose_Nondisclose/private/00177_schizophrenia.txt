I am a 19 year old male and for the past 7 months or so i have had headaches,dizziness, and jumpy vision. It all started one morning when i awoke with testicle pain in one testicle. It did not hurt when i urinated but it was constantly swore. The doctor thought that it could be an infection so he gave me some antibiotic. Ever since that day i have headaches. For the last month or two, i have been worrying 24/7 about the world and if the people around me are real life.  I have trouble thinking how they live their life when they are not around me. I can't stop thinking about it or worrying. These thoughts never leave my mind. I don't know what it could be. I think about it so much that i almost vomit from worrying but i can't stop though. I pray that it isn't schizophrenia. I have not heard any voices and my eyes are just jumpy and a little blurry at times but other than a little blurriness they are fine.I twitch a little bit, i don't know why. Please if you can post back quickly i really would like to hear what you think.
