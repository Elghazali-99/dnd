My Mom has always been physically and verbally abuse,ever since i can remember.My mom is bipolar and has a lot of anxiety problems,and i understand that but i just hate the way she treats me.Since I'm 15 now and I'm older my mom is less physically abusive,when i was little my mom used to sit on me and hold me down so i couldn't get up,she also used to hit me with a belt, and one time i remember she put a pillow over my face when i was about 7 and wouldn't let me up until i almost suffocated.
 Now she does stuff like that to my little brother who is 8, but i do help my brother when my mom acts like this.....My mom is now very verbally abusive she now calls me things like Fat,Stupid,Useless,Worthless,Lazy and a *****. And now she is holding one little thing against me that makes me feel so stupid which is that i lost $20 that she gave to me to hold on to for a sec while we were in the car ,and when I got out of the car my mom asked me where the money was and i said i  didn't know and it happened to blow off my lap when i got out of the car...i told i didn't mean to and i was sorry and she keeps saying how stupid i am and how my friends wouldn't have lost $20 when it was sitting right on there laps ..no wonder they make straight a's and you make 70's and 80's.
  Since my mom is Bipolar and has other problems she always does this thing where she will get so mad and yell at me and hit me and then 10 minutes later she will come in my room and be so nice and apologize and say stuff like i didn't mean to do that and you know i love you...and I am bipolar too and i have been cutting cause i feels worthless and i have been starving myself because i feel so fat and my cutting and bulimia is not all because of what my mom does and says its a lot of other reasons but  i just don't know what to say to her and i just can't take it anymore and i don't know what to do! please help!
