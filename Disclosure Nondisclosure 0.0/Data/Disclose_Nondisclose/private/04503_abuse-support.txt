Hey, I'm a 15 year old girl and I've been with my boyfriend for just over a year and a half. At the start of this relationship we were perfect. Everything just seemed perfect in any way possible. However, Over the course of this relationship, he has started to get controlling. I never noticed this before but now I think he definitely is.  I have tried to end the relationship quite a lot of times before without any outcome. However one time in March this year, I broke up with him for a week but it didn't last. The problem im having here is that he is now extremely controlling. One minute he's perfect and amazing but the next he is argumentative, telling me what to do, who to see, where to go, what to wear... he also doesn't let me post on Instagram or Snapchat (both social media) and he doesn't let me have facebook. I have got Twitter but as soon as he found out he went in a huge mood with me and said I was breaking his heart by having it, and every time I asked for a reason why he just changed the subject or said "i don't know!!!". He is really getting me down and it's really impacting my life. He doesn't let me stay at friends houses, go to parties... he even tries to get me to speak in a certain way! ( I have been brought up to speak in not very good English and he has a massive issue with this) I need to break up with him  but whenever I go to break up with him he threatens to kill himself, that he has no other reason to live. He also threatens to cut himself, I think he does this because he knows I have a past of this.. almost like blackmail because he knows how much it affects me. Please, I need some body's help and fast i went to his house before and spoke to him about the problems im having and he seems to understand but it isn't going to last very long. Please, any advice will be brilliant and much appreciated.
