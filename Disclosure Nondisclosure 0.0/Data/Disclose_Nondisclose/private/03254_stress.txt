Sometimes it seems like life hits me like a snoball effect.  Everythings fine, and then all of a sudden I see more coke on the counters, from a coke bottle that my 12 year old son exploded the night before, that I've already told him 20 times to clean up.  At the same time my seven year old son wants to argue that his alloted time on the internet isn't up, when I know it is.   Right before that I see my bf's car drive away just as I'm pulling in the drive way w/ a bunch of grocieries to cook a lunch that he wanted.  My 12 year old decides he's going to a friends house, looks like I'll be cooking a big lunch for just me and my two young children!  To top if off, I have jalapeno in my eye.  A little bit of yelling and screaming and typing, I think I feel a little better (save my eye)  but I hope it's not just until the next time 5 things attack me within a matter of minutes.  Oh yeah, and my daughters damn cat wouldn't stay off the table while I was chopping vegtables........Waaa-waa right?
