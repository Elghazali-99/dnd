Okay so this is kind of complicated but my boyfriend fingered me a few times (that was like the day my period ended and we have never had sex), he says there was no *** involved while he did it, he says he was careful and he is very sure of that. And I was okay with that but then I didn't get my period and I'm a very worried person I literally freak out over everything. But I was kind of feeling a little bit nauseous and my boobs hurt and sometimes my back as well and idk if this has anything to do with this but sometimes I burp a lot? (gross I know), maybe its just cause I freak out about it and its just my imagination. I also get discharge a lot, I don't know if this is normal but yeah. I always get it, I guess. So yeah I've been worrying about this for a few weeks, I also took 4 pregnancy tests (2 before my period was supposed to come and 2 after) they were all negative. And for some reason I'm still worried. Maybe I took the tests too early or something I don't know. Well heres the thing, I usually got my period pretty regularly on the 19th every month, then my boyfriend and I broke up (we got back together) and I got it on the 28th last month, so idk maybe my period is late cause of that. Maybe my whole cycle went off track. Who knows? But yes I'm very worried and I'm wondering if I could be pregnant? I mean I'm going to a doctor in 2 days but it worries me so much. Please help... I'm 15 btw.
