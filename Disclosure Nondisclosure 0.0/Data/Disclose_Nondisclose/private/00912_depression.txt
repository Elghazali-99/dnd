Dear Doctor,
I was recently hospitalized for severe depression and panic disorder, and am currently in an outpatient CBT program at the same hospital - the program is terrific and I'm learning a great deal.  The problem is medication - I'm hugely sensitive to drugs and virtually every SSRI or SSNRI I've tried - Cymbalta, LexaPro, and now Zoloft - really exacerbates the anxiety.  The psychiatrist affiliated with the program has been wonderful and understanding, and prescribed .5 mg of Xanax four times a day to address the anxiety.  I'm still anxious and fearful, but also incredibly fatigued, sleeping a great deal, and - here's the worst part - have had severe diarrhea for 3 weeks.  I love food, but cannot tolerate anything.  We've tried tapering the Zoloft from 150 down to 100 mg, but the diarrhea is just as bad.  I so much want to get well;  my doc understands that, and is also emphatic that my depression is severe and that I really need to be on an anti-depressant for a long time.  Is it possible that some people just can't tolerate SSRIs?   My body reacts tho them as if they are "speed."  Even before I got sick, I couldn't even handle drinking a cup of coffee - it was too stimulating.
Are there alternative drugs that work?   Would the older trycyclics be less stimulating?  I'm in my 40s and need to be able to think clearly, and want to accomplish a lot more and get through this.
Thank you for your help.
