hello everyone,
      i'm fresh outta high school left home for college. i'm a big procrastinator and i feel like i'm overloaded but when i think of everyhting i have to do it narrows down to not even half the schoolwork i had in high school and a job where i work less then 22 hours a week. in high school i had 6 classes and i was an A student. when i lived at home i helped with my family's farm chores, cleaning out pig pens and chicken coups and feeding all the animals in the afternoon. i answered phones for the family business and still managed my grades and lazy days out with friends. i now have three classes and i dont have class everyday either.  this shouldnt make me feel so stressed and i'm wondering if it's just homesickness or lazy selfishness.  i am organized to some extent and though i procrastinate i get things done right before there due. i moved into my grans house and i got a job to pay rent. i learned to drive and i have everything i need. i dont know anyone here but i still talk to friends from my home city, and i drive down on my day off. i dont believe my trouble is depression or because of a lack of friendship but i need to get my *** in gear. how can i get over my problem and get back my A grades?  this may sound like a pampered kids whining but i really need to get back my old "happy to get it done" attitude. i just dont understand whats making me act like i'm a stupid lazy person and it's bugging me more and more.   please help me.
