Last November, I overdosed on a bottle of Effexor xr. Thankfully, I had no symptoms physically but I noticed that I began to feel worse and worse mentally. After a couple weeks I started to feel better. But then, Dr. Muhammed started me on an another mood stabilier and anti depressant. It was about 12 in the morning one night, and I felt really good. Then, all of a sudden I got this paranoid feeling of being watched. I started seeing shadows moving around in my room next 2 the window. And I started 2 get this really uneasy feeling. Suddenly, I started getting all these horrible urges 2 do really, really bad things. I wanted 2 attack everybody I saw. I wanted 2 stab people in their throats with pencils and choke my husband and then gouge out his eyes, and everytime I held my baby, I was tempted 2 throw her across the room. Before the overdose, I had never had urges like that before. They scared me very badly. I stayed that way and lived in fear for a little over half a year. I was just wondering if maybe the overdose had something to do with it...Maybe it could've altered the chemical imbalance in my brain worse than what it already was? I have been diagnosed  with Scitzo-effective disorder, but I honestly don't think I'm insane and neither does my therapist Rose, who I've worked with for four years.
