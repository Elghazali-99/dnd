This might be a long explanation but um, I need help. (Sorry.)
 Sept 29, I have unprotected sex, he did finish in me...
I've been looking up on different websites each site said on that day apparently I was "ovulating."
Now I do just want to say, I am on birth control, but I keep reading that I wasn't taking it right, you know, where I think it's supposed to at the same time each day or 2 hours apart at most is what I've found.. well yeah no, mine would be 3 - 4 hours apart at less, 7 hours maybe apart at most on each day. and I would have days where I would miss one pill and have to take 2 on one day. (and my mom even mentioned I was't taking it right.. :/) Anyways, I don't know if I'm having a period, because this is more then a week early. It started about a day and half ago. It's very light, and I have heavy periods. It'll be sometimes light pink to red/brown. It's kind of.. gooyish watery(sorry for the tmi) and it doesn't really get on my pad much, and it'll go away for a while and then start randomly. I am having cramps with it, I just don't know. I've been really nasueated, I just wanna sleep, I threw up this morning and I never throw up. I just feel really weird, and my nipples are highly senstive, they never are.. Sigh..
 Is my body being weird..
