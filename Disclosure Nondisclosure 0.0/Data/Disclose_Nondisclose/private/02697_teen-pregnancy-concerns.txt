Heyy guys its me again But i PROMISE im nt here to waste time..
She is 9 days late today.. Would u say that is still normal? 
 Also guys i dont understand when they say you can get pregnant on your period. For instance in my last activity it was 2 days before her november period. SAY sperm did get ino my gf vagina (i know it daint ovviouslt as weve already been through all this, but for example say we had sex) 2days before her november period... ovulation has already occured 2 weeek before.. And then she GETS her period the next day.. So how can this sperm while now ON her november perod period fertilize the egg for the december period if she is a 31day cycle.. Im sure that is prettyy common sense she cannot.. As even if sperm lasts 7 days isnside ovulation cant take place 8 days in the cycle if she 31day cycle? It really winds me up when fase interent sites dont exlain proper. Doo they mesan you can get pregannt on your period if you have sex on the last days of it and you are a short cycle so u ovulate early... Please can some1 knowledge me up on this....
