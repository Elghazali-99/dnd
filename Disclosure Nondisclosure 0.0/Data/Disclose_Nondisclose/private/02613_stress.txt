The question is: Is it only me?
 and How much of stress in today's world is caused by the methods and practices of the "organizations" 
( ironic name ) that put in place these frustrating labyrinths to navigate and slowly over time eradicate human help from the equation? Too complicated of a question/statement? That's the nature of the beast and the consequences of a machine that is overtaking us all in one way or another.
 ".....please listen to all the options since our menu's have changed" REALLY?!? Everyone's menu has changed? 
"Well you know what I mean" REALLY?!? You think "I" know what you mean? Don't be so sure. I know that I can't even find the place to change my password here and using the mind that I have left, the logic that has helped me survive the Army amongst other things, I can not figure out why I have to go round and round attempting to find that which could be one link with two words " change password ".
 I have several repeating offenders in everyday life and like my 87 yo mother even notices and says: " They will never admit that they did anything wrong. But they will always have an answer for you; even if it makes no sense."
 Far out Mom. At least I know that you have been swallowed up by buying into the dysfunctional narrative.
 Anyone else see/feel/think similar thoughts or am I the only one slipping into darkness?
