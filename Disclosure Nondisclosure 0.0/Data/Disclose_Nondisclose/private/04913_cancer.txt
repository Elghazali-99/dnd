I was recently diagnosed with ovarian cancer. One week after my hysterectomy on May 21st I had severe back pain. I recently switched to a new oncologist that sent me for a MRI of my spine.
 The results state: Broad based small disc herniation L5-S1 level this is central towards the left. This causes mild posterior displacement of the left S1 nerve root and mild/moderate narrowing of proximate portion left neural foramina. Clinically correlate any radicular symptoms through the left L5 and/or left S1 distribution.
 I was referred to a orthopedic specialist I will see on Wednesday. Just wondering if someone can interpret this before I see someone. I did not injure my spine in any way as I was only a week out of surgery when the pain hit.... that was 10 weeks ago so I have had this horrible pain for too long. They have tried pain meds, Ibuprofen, heating pad and Flexeril so far with no relief. Any help would be gratefully appreciated. I just want to make sure my cancer has not spread to my spine.
