Hey, guys! I am not a teenager myself, but my friend (more like little sister) is and I really need some clarification regarding her wanting a baby. She just turned 16 in August and her boyfriend will be 16 in January. They both desperately want a baby! I have warned her and warned her again against this and it really is tearing my nerves up. I love her so much and, even though we aren't related, I look at her as my little sister. Her parents are very strict so she and her boyfriend aren't allowed to hang out therefore, eliminating sex. (Thank God) But she has come up with an absolutely most unreasonable and illogical way of getting pregnant. Her boyfriend will go into the men's restroom at her work and ejaculate inside a MEDICINE DROPPER. He will then give it to her right away so she can enter the restroom and, uhm, inject it inside of her. I'm glad that she is comfortable enough to share her "plans," with me but I am extremely concerned. I guess my question is, could she get pregnant by doing this? The sperm would surely die inside of the medicine dropper, right? Even if it will only be in there for a minute at the most. I'm not sure what to do or how to stop her... Thanks in advance!
