A couple of yrs ago papsmear came back normal but my doctor wanted a transvaginal ultrasound,because of my abnormal periods and that came back saying my results were that I had a thick endometrium lining 2.2mm with a stripe.. Dr issued provera I think its called three times a month on the same days every month.. Well I ended up in the emergency room multiple times, bleeding wouldn't stop had to replace my bed and carpet in my room. It was awful.. I stopped taking it after four months because basically I couldn't bare to bleed out like that everyday. I went to follow up my Dr and she wanted to put me on birth control to regulate my periods.. The cost was too high and also promoted weight gain... So we went with metformin. I still take that but my menstrual is still abnormal. Here I am now at yr two, got my papsmear. Again normal but sent for another ultrasound and just said 2.2cm endometrium lining, with a nabathrian cyst 1mm. So did wants to do a biopsy and go from there. My body produces only estrogen not progesterone. Particularly caused by my weight of being morbidly obese. I continue on going through again with drs orders. Have you had any experience like this? What was your outcome?? Any Drs out there reading this??? Does this seem like a good plan vs the other one? I'm confused, scared and am at risk of cancer because it runs in my dads side of the family.. My youngest cousin had a hysterectomy at 16 yrs old.. HELP????
