I am 15 and I have trouble sleeping. I had my first sleep paralysis dream a couple months ago (It runs in my family), and since then I have been experiencing unusual things. Ever since I was a kid I have had, I guess what you would call panic attacks, but never as severe as the one I had a week ago. It was the most horrible thing I have ever experienced. I was sitting curled up on my stairs crying, and I was hearing people talking like a buzz in a mall, with all the voices intermingled and it grew louder and it almost echoed in my ears. I had a strange falling sensation the whole time and trouble breathing and I was sure I was going to die. I had a strong urge to go further up the stairs and hurt my twin sister. We got in a huge fight and she smashed a light bulb on my arm, which is what started the whole thing. I wanted her to keep the light on because I am scared of the dark, and it helps me fall asleep when the light is on. I was imagining horrible things, violent things that I would never do! I wish I could explain what was happening better, but it was just too bizarre and terrifying for me to put into words.  I am very scared that I am experiencing schizophrenia symptoms, and I am to scared to tell my mom about  what has been happening. I am scared she will think I am lying. I don't know what to do.
