I realize I've already posted a question, but I feel my "issue" has only grown worse.
 So, uhh.. let's start from scratch? I'm 14 years old, and.... I'm not really sure anymore. My life is good, my life is bad. I have everything I could ever want, I have nothing at all. I'm completely sane, yet I feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm a decent student, but lately I have no motivation to do anything whatsoever. I'm "happy" around my friends, but when I get home - or when I'm alone - I just sink back into my own little bubble and want to die. I can't talk to anyone, because I have no one. My dad is emotionally abusive, my mom is too wrapped around my brother's life and her own to even acknowledge my presence, my brother.... well, let's just say I'd be better off discussing things with a goldfish, the rest of my family is much too argumentative to fit in a word and/or they dislike me strongly, my friends are no help - they'd suggest I kill myself which shouldn't be my top priority at the moment. 
 I also get extremely bad - which I belieeevvveeeeee is - vertigo. Like... I get majorly dizzy and can't think. I barely remember anything. The most sleep I've gotten this week is 2 hours a night and then I'm messed up during school. No, I can't go to the doctors about this. My dad is laid off and my mom is currently losing her job. We're barely making it with what money we have, and a doctor's visit is not in our family budget. Sad truth.
 Even worse... that's not even a fourth of everything. 
I'm screwed. Any suggestions? Or should I just go lay in the road and wait for a semi?
 Sorry that was soooo unbelievably long.
