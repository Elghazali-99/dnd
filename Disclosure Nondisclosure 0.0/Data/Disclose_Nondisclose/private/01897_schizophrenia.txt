i am 14 and i'm not sure if i have schizophrenia. aparently, according to my friend, i have many symptoms and she persuaded me to look it up and do something about it. and she's right. i always feel like someone is out there and running to come and get me. whenever i try and tell anyone about how i feel about this they start running faster and it terrifiys me, so i can't tell anyone! sometimes i see black hands under doors and things moveing that my friend can't see. it scares me so much i sometimes cry and i have to tell eveyone it's just my hayfeiver (i don't get hayfeiver). it only really happenes at school or when i am on my own. i can also hear them alot, they wisper to me and bang and crash and night. i hear them walking beside me and i am really scared. i think they have chosen me because i can hear them. i really want to tell my mum but i am too scared to. whenever i try, i just can't, and so i get fustrated and angry and on some occations i had to run away to taulk to myself without anyone hearing. it really scares me. i can't tell my faimily because alot of things are going on and they all have alot to deal with already. and i don't know what to do or who to go to or whats wrong with me! please can someone give me some advise!! x
