I don't know what is wrong with me. I have almost all the signs of being a psychopath, but i wasn't born with this condition. And i do not have an urge or thoughts of hurting people. I do not have any emotions. I never cry or feel something like love, hate or happiness. I can look at one view on something and see tens and hundreds of other views. I can understand other peoples emotions to the point that i can tell what they why they feel that way, and what they will do next and what their intentions are. I can lie without people ever finding out about that. Although i do not think it's a good thing, but i'm just stating the facts. I do not feel any regret or remorse for anything. I do not feel sad when people get hurt or die. I do not feel anything. I am a good actor, and when i need to pretend that i feel sad i can always fake it. People can never tell that i'm acting. I am also intelligent, have a great memory, and very good at sports and pushing myself to the limit. Is there anything wrong with me? Should i consider myself a psychopath?
