I am at a complete loss and came across your site hoping for some answers. 
My husband and best friend took a terrible turn in his life. He has always been a responsible person and had a great work ethic. He got in a car accident, got addicted to pain meds and then got into trouble. Big trouble. He was arrested. If you knew him, he is the last person you would ever expect this from. I've known him nearly 20 years and this is just not him, at all. He has since lost his job, we lost our home, we lost it all and moved to another state to start over. He refuses to go to the NA meetings. He tried to go back to school but quit. He has not found work and slides further into depression each day. He hardly leaves the house, he hardly speaks to us and is horrible to be around. I've taken him to the Dr. who put him on Paxil and he is seeing him again today again because his anxiety and depression are at an all time high. I have to practically babysit him but he fights my help at the same time. He has no answers, said he is bored but still does nothing to make any changes. I have been inside his tornado of a life for the past 2 years and I can't take it much longer. I have tried everything and nothing makes him happy, nothing. I don't want to end my marriage but don't know what else to do. Please help.
