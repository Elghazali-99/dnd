I had (Thyroid Papillary Carcinoma) removed June 2013 along with removing my right Lymph node.  I've never smoked in my life before, but I fell into the wrong crowd about a month after my surgery whom gave me "Crystal Meth" to smoke. Stating that it helped them with their medical issues. I then realized that it made me feel better also. I have (Fibro Malaysia, PTSD,  chronic Gerd plus I've had two knee replacements , along with back problems). (I once was a serious Rock Climber from 1971- 1973). Then I fell 3 times so it ended my climbing. I haven't been able to walk or ride my bike for two years, plus my hands were always hurting with burning pain numbness etc. So I started doing "Crystal Meth"just a little here and there, which truly did help me to do the things I love doing. But now I have this terrible cough that won't go away. I've stopped smoking the Meth and I feel very ashamed that I even tried it.  i'm strictly taking my medications prescribed by my Dr's. I'm 60 years old. "I'm told I look 40 which is great". I'm a singer with a band, which I can still hit my high & low notes. 
My question is this; Did I create a huge problem for any future cancer appearing? Thank you.
