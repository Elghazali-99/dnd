All my 14 year old wants to do is stay inside all day everday and play video games and play on the internet. He gets invited to various things and friends call him, but he never wants to do any of it.He ignores texts and phone calls.He will then mope around the house and say hes bored after turning down an invite. My wife is militant about him getting a social life. I agree with her but I think she pushes too hard sometimes. I believe it makes him feel like a loser when she pushes. Anyway, its about the third week of his freshman year, this behavior started at the end of 8th grade. So naturalIy I just thought it was anxiety, but he has settled in and said its not as bad as he thought. Should I be worried that something bad is forming or is it just the teen/freshman blues? He was on the high honor roll all through junior high and has already failed a couple of tests in high school. He has alot of friends but I have noticed the phone calls and pop ins are few and far between anymore.
