Hey everyone,
 I'm a single mom now for two years. I have a 5 and almost 3 Year old. I was diagnosed with bpd a few months after my first child. By that time I was in an emotionally and mentally clusterfuck of a relationship with my ex husband. I still believe I was not the only one with issues. I had no support and was emotionally and mentally abused and manipulated.it was toxic. so when my second child was born I stayed for three months and made the choice I couldn't raise my two children in that environment and started off on my own. I was doing great. I found confidence and believe in my self, I felt empowered with a can do attitude. I dated a bit and currently am in a relationship for 8 months. A great one. Iv never been in a more respectful, loving caring relationship and am very very grateful. Recently I have looked more into bpd. Read some articles and books. I feel I have a better understanding as to why I am who I am. But I can't help notice my attitude and short patients with my children. I'm not physically abusive and am a very loving mother but I feel my short temper and wanting of control could effect my children every where I look the one thing I take away is that " I'm **** out of luck." My children are doomed my relationship will fail hell leave me when he has enough. Is there hope? I'm not suicidal. And nor do I have explosive episodes with my boyfriend it's more the hopeless stressed I have no idea what's happening crying episodes. I am very outgoing and happy and he says that's why he loves me buy I'm scared he's going to get sick of my irrational emotional bouts. Encouragement? Tips? Help?
