Hi there,
 I'm a 44 yr old woman in good general health.  I'm wondering if recent issues are likely related more to menopause or to something scarier like alzheimers.  A bit of background: I had a hysterectomy 5 years ago due to heavy menstrual cycle & severe cramping (adenomyosis).  I've always had problems with memory - and it certainly isn't getting any better, but nothing huge there :)  Recently I've noticed a bit of trouble reading things like road signs or billboards - the words jumble a bit then are ok, so my reading time is decreasing (I am an avid reader, so this is disturbing).  Oddly, I don't notice as much when I'm reading books etc.  
 But an incident on Saturday morning scared me badly - I was running some errands on my way to a meeting.  I drove from one shop over to the local grocery store, picked up what I needed, then as I walked out I was suddenly hit with the realization that I had NO IDEA how I'd gotten there - did my husband drop me off?  Did I drive?  Where was my car? Luckily the parking lot was fairly empty and I drive a little blue FIAT - it stands out.  I saw a little blue FIAT and was trying to convince myself that it must be mine, I must have driven it there.  I walked toward it filled with dread, then all of a sudden it came back to me in a flood.  I almost wept.  This "episode" lasted between 30 secs and a minute.  It was horrible.  
 I don't know if this is possibly hormonal - my mom went through menopause by my age - I had a hysterectomy so I don't know where I'm at with that.  But both my grandmothers suffered varying degrees of dementia (parkinson's with one, the other was undiagnosed).  Anyway, if anyone can give any insight, I would appreciate it.  I have a dr's appt on the 31st, but this is weighing on my mind.
 Thanks!
