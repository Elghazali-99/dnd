im 15 years old and ive been feeling lonely for a long time now (about 2 years) ive got a small group of friends but i just feel like im not happy with what ive got i can afford most luxuries but i just feel alone. I get easily irritated and angry and i find myself taking it out on others quite a lot of tine by shoutin at them for no reason. It might be because im not that popular i have a few spots, ive never so much as kissed a girl and have been rejected many times   causing me to give up hope as in an all boys school i see girls occasionally and they want nothing to do with me. I have had the odd thought of suicide ( dont really think its worth mentioning) and i feel myself losing intrest in things i like and becoming easily bored with things i used to enjoy. I find it difficult to sleep as well j dont know if im just a spoilt brat or i am seriously depressed. My grades are dropping a tiny bit and im not trying as hard at school. I dont want to talk about it with my family as... well i dont know i just cant bring myself to do it in case im ridiculed or something. Im becoming more and more withdrawn as i spend most days in my room by myself and i just feel worthless. I just want to know what people think as i dont know if im just a spoilt brat or am genuinely depressed. if you think i am could you please tell me what to do?
