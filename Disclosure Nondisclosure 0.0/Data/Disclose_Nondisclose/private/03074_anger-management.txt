I have an issue with my anger, I get very short with things and often get very paranoid and when an argument or something comes from it than I cant stop thinking about it all day. It consumes me, I have bad anxiety as well and a lot of it I hear you have to face it to break it and I do, but it is still there, in my dreams, in my mind inside me. I also get very paranoid and have a tendency to freak out about little things and I think of every outcome and they just tear me apart. I also have many outlets and no matter what im doing all this is still there, I freak out and cant control it. I realize im just trying to find a distraction to get past whatever is bothering me, or with my anxiety and anger and in turn not thinking about it In the back of my mind I think it even more! it just is a cycle and it gets bad.I try and try to deal with it, and go on and put myself out there but it just does not work. i feel right now im not even explaining it right its just difficult any ideas as to what it could be please help.
