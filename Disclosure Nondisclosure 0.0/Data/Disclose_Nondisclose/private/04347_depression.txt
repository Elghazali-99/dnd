I have been in a relationship with someone for about a year now who was married to a very mentally and physically abusive husband and continues to be this way even after five years of being divorced. The relationship was going good for the first six months because he left the state to do training for a job and her mind was free of him for once,  she was like a new person. Unfortunately for both of us he was placed back in her home state for his new job.  When he came back he acted like his life had changed and he was ready to be a good dad and husband.  So how he managed to convince her to go to couples therapy to try an fix things between them and she decided to put our relationship on ice almost as if it was like we never had one.  One other element of our relationship was that it is a long distance one and it just so happens his change of heart happened to coincide with my trip down there once I left his colors changed and he was back to his old self. Things were moving in the right direction again for the past month and she seemed happy that I am now buying a home down there and then he struck again to the point where she had to get and order of protection.  Things have gone from daily communication to maybe one or two times a week now and it seems the more good I do for her the quieter she seems to get.  It seems to me the abuse has become her normal life and she doesn't know how to deal with the good almost as if she doesn't deserve it.  I am not and will not walk away from her she is worth everything it takes to help her and I want to know the best way to go about it.
