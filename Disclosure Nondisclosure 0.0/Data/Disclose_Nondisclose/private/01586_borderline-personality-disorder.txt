I finally had a name for it. I remember my doctor diagnosing me as being bipolar when I was younger, and while some of the symptoms fit, there was so much more to it. After seeing the same psychiatrist for over 7 years and not feeling any better, I decided to look into other disorders. When I read about BPD, I was stunned. It was like someone was writing every detail about my life. My fiance dismisses any type of mental disorder, and says that people just claim to have one to excuse some part of their life. But when I read him the description, he too agreed and was amazed at how accurately it described me. I feel so grateful to have learned what this is. I am 30, and I have been through so much already, but I feel like I am young enough to have a chance to learn to manage this condition so I can have a happy life. In order to tackle any issue, you have to know what the root problem is. I know that this is going to be a long and treacherous battle, but thank the Lord God Almighty for revealing to me what is wrong. I no longer feel like an evil, worthless and crazy person. I understand myself, and I feel compassion towards myself, something I have never felt. I have always been so hard on myself, and very judgemental towards myself. I often have contemplated suicide thinking that I would never be good at anything, all I would do is end up alone and failing at everything I attempted. I now understand myself. This gives me hope.
