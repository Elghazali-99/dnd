I've never met my birth mother, and my Dad is one of those people who is in jail for two years, out for three months, in jail again... I've been raised by my Grandmother since the state stripped my Dad's custody of me at age 9. Im 13 now and since a few months ago, things have gone on around my family to the point where both of my sisters had to go into foster homes, and so now Im an only child. So my family is very small; a Gaurdian, two uncles and two aunts. We've gone through a lot of tragic events together, and Im always sad or angry when I am around them. A lot of it is because I can never be happy around them, I can never laugh or have a good time because I feel like a stone's been heaved onto my chest everytime I see any of their faces. That is why I love school so much, with having a lot of friends and all, but now that it's summer vacation my Family wants me to do things with them and I do because I feel bad. I hate not having a proper family and I hate how they try and fail to make things better with them. I love them, I do, but they are practically like symbols of war and hate to me. The saddest part is that I WANT to be happy around them, and I want to find happiness in their company, but I just can't. I want my friends, but my family is the very thing keeping me from hanging out with them. 
 Anything would help right now...
