I have three children & have been with my boyfriend for going on 2 years now. Their father is in the picture and we have split custody. Recently there has been issues with my 14 year old son that should be addressed by his father, but the situation is being ignored by his father. My boyfriend is involved with my children and it is concerning to him that his father isn't making efforts to address the issue. This along with the fact he feels more of a friend to my kids makes my boyfriend feel disconnected, unequal, and not a part of my family. I just learned this today and I am having troubles processing this information. Can someone she'd some light? I have felt that I have made him feel involved in various activities and asked and received input from him regarding the kids. The only thing I have kept separate is involve the between my boyfriend and my kids father in efforts to avoid confrontations between them.my kids father is not the friendliest and open to criticism from others. Please help.
