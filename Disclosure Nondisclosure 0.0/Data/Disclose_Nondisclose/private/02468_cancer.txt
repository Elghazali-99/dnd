I have been undergoing some testing for over a year do to a chronic rash that burns, causes fevers, bleeds and oozes, and has been very uncomfortable. I had a lymph node removed in my groin in August, however due to the amount of prednisone I was on, they ruled any findings unreliable. I had recently noticed some hip pain on that side, but the doctors said that nothing came up in the X-ray they performed. Now the incision site has become swollen and painful, all the way up my side and down my thigh, so much so that I cannot lean on that side or rest my arm on it while I am sitting or anything. I noticed some large grape sized lumps that feel very deep on my thigh, starting at the incision and going halfway down my thigh. They hurt to the touch and are sore in general. Since I first noticed them they have seemed to spread further down my thigh. What could this be? I am on cyclosporine, an immosuppressant, but is it even possible to get an infection months after the surgery?
