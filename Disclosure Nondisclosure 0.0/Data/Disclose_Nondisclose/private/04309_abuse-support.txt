I was married for 4 years and I was with my ex-husband for 5. I went from being a strong, independent woman to a resisting slave. He was somehow able to change things about me that no one else  could - who I hung out with, how much I spent, how long I was gone from the house...even what I wore and how I cut/what color I dyed my hair. He used my mental illness against me until it got to the point that I could hardly function because he would pick fights and push buttons that he knew would set it off. Somehow, I let him do it to me.  I was able to get out of it because I was still strong underneath. That's what I keep telling myself.
 It has been 10 months since I left him and I feel weaker than ever. I hate him and I will never go back, but I feel weak. I panic out of no where. I flinch and cry after certain things, most often they would be things that wouldn't phase most people, happen. I have been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. 
 So, my question is this - does anybody know of any online support groups for abused women dealing with PTSD? I can't drive yet  (that was one of the things that he would scare me with because he knew how I felt about reckless driving and speeding. It's the fear of police above all else that sends me into a panic before I even start the car, among other factors,) but I am tired of dealing with this alone. There are things that I can't tell my family or people that I know - heck, I can't even talk to my psych about it and I've been with her for 3 years. I need to talk to women who understand -  who won't find me filthy for things that I felt that I couldn't control. I can't do it alone.
 Thank you for your time,
Kat
