I have had a serious bout with depression starting last September. I have had a best friend for 5 and a half years and said some mean things and didn't even remember saying it until I think it was too late. recently after I remember why they weren't talking to me anymore I wrote them a letter and told him what was going on with me . That I was clinically depressed and I took it out on him. My depression stemmed from losing my mom 2 years ago and last september started to fear going through the Holiday with out her. After that the first of the year i was being harassed at work and ended up walking out leaving completely after I talked it over with my best friend.......... that was the downward spiral. After that I would fly off the handle at little things and he didn't know what was wrong and I didn't know I was doing it. Now he won't talk to me and understandably I know why. Last night I sent a letter telling him what happened and to please forgive me and that I am so sorry for what I said and am very ashamed and there is never a justified reason to treat a best friend that way . I am lost ..........I did wrong and paying dearly for it. To the point where it is making want to leave this place. I know I can work it out with myself but my friendship is hurt and so is my heart.  I am taking prozac and have been on it for years I need to get an adjustment on the drug.... I am waiting for my new insurance to kick in form my new job. Please advise me what I need to do to patch that up as well as myself.
