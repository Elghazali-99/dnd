I am 15, i have been out of school for 2 years due to anxiety and depression. I cannot sleep at night which causes me to sleep all day and be tired every minute. I have seen 3 psychologists and 2 psychiatrists with no luck, i feel as though noone can help me and i am too trapped to help myself. my depression causes me to feel deeply unhappy and very emotionally empty. I am scared that i can never get better and that i will grow up with no education or any healthy relationships with people. my grandmother is schizophenic and i am very scared that i am going to drive myself to the same illness by sleeping all day and having no social life. i lay in bed all night thinking and sometimes i think i am going crazy with some of the thoughts that have been coming into my head lately.. i have been having very violent thoughts toward my close family and people i care about. sometimes when the smallest thing ticks me off i imagine taking their life violently and bloodily, i also imagine myself enjoying it and these thoughts don't distress me i just don't know if they are normal. i also have found myself making more detailed plans to actually kill my dad, we have a lot of unresolved issues between us but even i don't know why i have this much hatred for him?
