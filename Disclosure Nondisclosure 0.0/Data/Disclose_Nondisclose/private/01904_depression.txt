I use to have such a great social life. In high school and the first couple of years after I was always hanging out, having fun with my friends, life was great! I even had a girl friend but unfortuanely it wasn't the greatest relationship as we were both immature and we fought alot.
 Anyway as the years went on, I started to lose touch with my friends. People moved, some got involved in partying(I drink on ocassion, but i'm not a partier), and others got in serious relationships
 My girlfriend and I broke up, well actually she left me for a guy we had been hanging out with. I was mad and said stuff I shouldn't have but hey, when you are 21 and somethin like that happens, you get mad. lol
 Anyway 4 years later I'm 25 and it's been a struggle the past couple of years. I lost my job so I'm starting over now with a new one. I have noticed I don't have much of a social life anymore. Alot of my friends have moved out of the area, some out of state, and alot of my friends have gotten married and are starting families. I sort of feel left out.
 Even a guy i called my best friend my whole life has been drifting apart from me. He never contacts me anymore and is usually to busy to do anything with me. Sometimes I wanna ask him what the hell did I do but I don't wanna look desperate.
 ANyway I know I'm still young and I could go out and make new friends but its hard to. Alot of people go to bars and to be honest that's not my scene at all. I also live in a small town so it's not like we have alot of activities. Alos, part of me is afraid to ask people if they would want to hang out because I'm afraid they may reject me
 My co-workers are awesome but they are older than me and have families so hanging out isn't a option really
 I don't know where I'm going with this but i just had to say it and if anyone has advice, I would appreciate it
 Thanks
