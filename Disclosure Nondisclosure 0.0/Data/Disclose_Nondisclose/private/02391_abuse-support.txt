My daughter, then at time was 10. Her father at time took her a shower cause he said she was dirty. In her defense she says she wasnt. He did not touch her while taking this shower but watched her clean her body parts. It made her feel gross and wrong and very uncomfortable. She repeatedly asked him to leave and he said no. He watched her clean her body parts. Throughly. It made her so horrible and grossed out and wrong that she tried hiding in a corner to not let him see. We have been in a domestic and child abuse and neglect relationship with this man(her father) for 14 years. I finally divorced him cause of his abuse to me. There is another incident in dressing room where he took her in to change her bras for school. He watched her change her bras and made sure they fit her voluptuous body at being 10. I find myself not ever trusting him with her or my 5 year old daughter that he specializes in giving gifts and attention to. My question is, Is this appropriate cause this is her father and will it hold up in court so he doesnt do this to my other daughter?
