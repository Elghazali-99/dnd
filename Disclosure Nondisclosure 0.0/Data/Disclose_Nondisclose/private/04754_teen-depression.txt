Hey, I am 15 years old and I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't have many friends, but the ones that I have are great. Throughout middle school everything was worse and I had no friends. or anything like that. Even though I have some friends now I feel so alone and like there is just nothing left anymore. Recently I have been very irritated at things. Like every little thing just irks me, like my mom, or sounds. I have also been feeling depressed, sad and useless for the past couple of years. Everyday I think about dying, but some days I am okay until the afternoon, then start thinking about dying. I have harmed my self for a while now, not cutting my wrist or anything, just making marks on my arm. Sorry if this is sad or whatever, i just don't have anyone I can tell all of this too. I think that if I say something wrong then everyone will hate me, or act how I act at home at school. I just feel so useless, like everything I do or say is wrong. I also hate myself, everything I say, how I speak, how I do things, just everything. Sorry if I repeat myself I just don't know what to say. I have contemplated suicide one too many times like cutting myself, jumping, or taking a bottle of pills. I am just tired of feeling this way, and I am afraid soon I just might end it all.
