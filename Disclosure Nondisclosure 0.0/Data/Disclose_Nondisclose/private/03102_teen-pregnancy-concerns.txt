July 21,2012 I lost my virginity to a guy. We'll call him 'E'. Well E left me a few months later. We decided to give us another try in July 2013. We got to know each other better. We didn't have sex again until November 29th. Lately I have been feeling really tired and have had cramps for a few days now and tonight started feeling sickish. I don't know what to do. I live in a small town so I can not buy a pregnancy test without the whole town knowing. I can't have someone else buy one for me because there is no one in this town that I trust. I am thirteen. Now please don't say things bad about that. I will tell you my mom is never home and is always out with her boyfriend and my dad is out of the picture my whole life. I have raised myself my whole life and have the maturity level higher than you know. I also can not go to my doctor. As you can tell by my age I can not drive and my doctor is a kids doctor, not a doctor for kids expecting kids. What do I do? How can I tell if I am really pregnant?
