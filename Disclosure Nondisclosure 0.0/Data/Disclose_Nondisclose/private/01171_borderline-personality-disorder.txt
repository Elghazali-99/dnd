I've been in a relationship with a woman who, through some traumatic experiences over the past year and a half, made her way through progressively worse diagnoses and eventually wound up with BPD.
We were seperated about a year ago, and a short while back started again.
Not knowing the full extend of BPD symptoms before I was affected by it, leading to the prior seperation, but after grasping the effect it has on her it's clear to me what's fake and what isn't, I do know her that well.
 As such, I've decided to not engage her in any negative mood swings and provide the same love and support with good faith about getting her back on her feet and us working out, and I was wondering about other experiences and advice in dealing with this.
 She has turned on me out of the blue. Apparently she still had feelings for me, but did seem to impulsively set up elaborate dramatic scenarios to repulse me once she let me in too close.
I've found a lot of peace in not engaging her in these shenanigans, not responding to irrational feelings at all.
 By this I mean that if she turns on me again out of the blue, instead of raising my own voice or trying to rationalize her, I'll just give her a kiss on the cheek and proceed with my daily routine, letting her know that she's having a mood swing (she has acknowledged her BPD and is working on it), that I still love her just as much and I'm simply not getting into an argument, and that if she wants to talk about it when she feels better my door's open for her.
 What are your thoughts? I'd particularly like responses from BPD partners themselves, as it seems like a good solution thusfar but I want to know if it could have further ramifications, and I'd love to get a point of view in this similar to hers.
