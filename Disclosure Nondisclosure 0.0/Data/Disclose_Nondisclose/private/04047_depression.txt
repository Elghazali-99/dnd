I was diagnosed with depression 8 years ago. The first time I suffered depression I was very young and even at that point in life, had suicidal thoughts. I took medication and seen a therapist and a few years later I was back to my normal self again. A few years after that, depression struck again. I again was prescribed medication and therapy which I completed and a year or so after was back again.  
After high school I went to college and had a great first year but approximately half way through my second year it all started to come back to me again. I wasn't attending school as much, not completing work and basically pushed away any friends I had in college and kept to myself. From then things have been escalating. At the start of my third year I started for the third time anti-depressants but in December could no longer afford to pay for them. My depression is currently back and its more overpowering than ever. I have quit school because the stress was too much and now its been over 2 weeks that I am in bed crying for 3/4 of my day. My parents are going to help me with medication payments once I see my doctor again but I am honestly hopeless. I don't believe this will ever go away. I really want to know if I am going to be like this for the rest of my life, passing a few years doing therapy, feeling good for a year then starting all over again.
Please someone if you have any suggestions or answers for me, let me know.   Thank you
