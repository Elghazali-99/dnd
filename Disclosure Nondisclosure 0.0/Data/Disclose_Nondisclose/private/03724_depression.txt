I'm sure I'm not alone here, but after feeling depressed for about 6 years, I've become ever more aware that I've always had some particular affinity for music that could be descrbied as melancholy.  Not necessarily just all out sad (although certainly much of it merges into this territory), but the windsome, nostolgic, doleful, brooding sonnets of the blue, the melancholy experience that is so much a part of the tragic beauty of life.
   With that in mind, I thought I'd see if others out there can relate to my experience feeling better - feeling joy and beauty and joie de vivre of life as a result of listening to blisfully melancholy music, and if so, to querry what some of your favorites are.  I'll offer a short list of mine.
   Fade Into You, Mazzy Star (one of my all time favorites)
 Paradise, Bruce Springsteen
 A Thousand Kissed Deep, Leonard Cohen, and others, e.g., Waiting for a Miracle, Take this Longing, etc.
 Song to the Siren, This Mortal Coil (don't listen to this if you're really down)
 Hallelujah, Jeff Buckley (written by Leonard Cohen)
 God, John Lennon
 Imagine, John Lennon (crossover)
 The Luckiest, Ben Folds
 The Last Song, Elton John
 The Sun's Gone Dim and the Sky's Turned Black, Johann Johannsson
 That Home, the Cinematic Orchestra (longer version called To Build a Home)
 Sounds of Slience, Simon & Garfunkle (not too dark)
 Mad World, Tears for Fears and others
 Everybody Hurts, R.E.M. (has to be on the list)
 Bittersweet Symphony, The Verve (I think actually has a partial uplift if the words are listened to)
 Dust in the Wind, Kansas, Sarah Brightman
 Outro, M83 (from the Cloud Atlass trailer)
 Angel, Sarah McLachlan
 Wicked Game, Chris Isaak
 My Immortal, Evanescence
 Moonlight Sonata, Beethoven
 Bach's Prelude
   I know some of these are pretty sappy, sentimental dirdges, but that is part of what I guess I like and identify with in them.  They're far from the only kind of music I like, but as I mentioned, I've just found I have a certain affinity and find solace in their expression.
