IAlready posted in sleep disorders but I need someone to answer me....an that section of the site doesn't seem very busy. I haven't being diagnosed with depression and I don't think I have it.... I just need help.
 I just turned 24....two children and long term partner. I'm waking up every single night from nightmares now....it's 4am....I'm sitting up smoking a cigarette trying to calm down after having woken myself up screaming out for my partner in my sleep...I had a nightmare I found my baby boy unresponsive next to me....I'm so disturbed. It's gotten to the point I'm getting scared to sleep every night because I don't know what my next nightmare will hold...sometimes I get raped in them or physically hurt/tortured....but this one involving my baby has really pushed me to the edge! I know it's common for children but I'm 24!!! This has been happening since last year then it got better for a few months then started again. I'm embarrassed to go to the doctor about it. How can I help myself?
