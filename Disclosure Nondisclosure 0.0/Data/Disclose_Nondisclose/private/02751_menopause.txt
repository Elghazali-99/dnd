I am a 44 year old female that had a hysterectomy in 1999 and then had both ovaries removed in 2001. I have had problems with memory, muscle and joint aches since my mid 30's. It has only gotten worse this past year or two.
 I had my hormones levels check in 2003 and they were perfectly normal at that time. I didn't understand how it was normal since I had no ovaries. However, my GYN explained to me that when he went to remove my ovaries, that they were so adhered to my pelvic wall and other organs, that he had to leave remanents of my ovaries and those remanents were actually producing hormones. I was like wow, never heard of that before. 
 Anyway, I decided to have another hormone test done a couple of weeks ago to see if a deficiency in my hormones could be what has been causing all of my symptoms because I have really become irritable this past year and I have always been a free spirit and very patient person, however, that is like a past life now days. I don't sleep well at night due to hot flashes and night sweats. 
 My FSH was 88.4 and my LM was -31.2. My primary doctor put me on Efforex last week and started me on 150 mg. That was an absolute nightmare!! I was deathy sick for two days after my first dose, so I didn't take anymore. My doctor will not put me on HRT due to family history of heart disease, breast cancer and strokes and I have a mitral prolapse.
 I am also having trouble getting my weight off now that I am in my 40's. 
 What exactly would you recommend? Would a one a day menopause pill help or do I need something like the progesterone cream as well as a menopausal vitamin to help me through all of this? What are your suggestions? 
 Thank you for taking the time to read my post. :)
