Need advice!  My husband and I are constantly fighting over how he talks to my son. How he treats him so sternly but talks to his stepdaughter with loving nurture.  He holds different standards for both.  My son sees and feels this, but my husband does not.  His daughter is 18 and now she is an adult she thinks she can do and say what she wants and that has made things worse.  She doesn't like the rules this make, equally for standard rules, understanding their are adjustments for age when appropriate.  Another big problem is that when ever something is said to my son, oh he is 13, she jumps in when it's not appropriate.  This things happen when I'm not there because she knows I am not there to stop it.  She he makes a comment, a general comment, she has to make a comment going against what he says, trying to make him look like he is wrong (even is she doesn't know what she is talking about).  I have tried to explain to both of them that he a 13 yr old boy with add that is going through puberty.  Not only is his hormones haywire, but so is his focus, along with his perceptions, that his logic is different, cause his brain is still developing.  But of course that goes in one hear and out the other.  This all has take am huge toll on our marriage and I don't know what else to do.
