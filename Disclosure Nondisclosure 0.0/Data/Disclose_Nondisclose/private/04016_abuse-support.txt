I am looking for a support group for my parents. My older sister (she is 30 years old) is emotionally abusive and has various behavioral issues. These issues have existed for more then a decade and after a year of therapy myself to fight anxiety and OCD, I want to find help for my parents. There is more that my sister has done to my parents and our entire family that I could possibly list in this text box. The truth is my sister has stolen more money from my parents then I can count by stealing their identity (credit cards, internet fraud, etc.) as well as stealing personal items (priceless jewelry, cameras, etc.). 
 My therapist suggested that my parents go to a support group for abused parents to help them cope and face the issues brought on my my sister. At this point they ignore the issue in hopes that is will resolve or to avoid confrontation.  Though they have worked with her the past with these issues she is stubborn and refuses to seek help.  After doing some research I am not finding much in the way of parental abuse. I want to help them, it is so hard to watch them be taken advantage of and abused.
