My dad is 63 years old, was diagnosed Schizophrenia 2 months ago. he was an alcoholic for almost 40 years, he suddenly quit it by himself around 1 year ago for no particular reason. His symptoms are basically hear things and delusion of persecution. He is in China, I am in nyc working, I feel bad that I cant stay with him to battle this disease there. He has been taking bunch of medicine from the beginning, but I dont see any better, he still has all of symptoms and now becomes very slow. The doctor recommended  electroconvulsive therapy treatments, and did the first time treatment a week ago, after that my dad said he felt really good about the treatment(I am not sure how much we should believe him), and he wants to continue the treatments(around 10 times in total), however the doctor said it is risky to keep doing this because my dad's blood pressure went to above 220mmHg. 
My mum and I dont know what we should do now, keep doing  electroconvulsive therapy treatments may cause another problem, but medicine doesnt seem any helpful at all, so much medicine may also cause anther problem. In China, the mental health medicine is very backward, I dont really trust doctors there, actually so much medicine have been taken without any improvement already made me upset, I am not sure if this normal for this disease? Should we transmit my dad to another better hospital in big cities to seek different treatment?
Please help!
Thank you very much for your time!
