Hello,
 I am new to this site and have been having alot of issues as of late. About a year ago I was diagnosed with depression  and anxiety. Even with medication I was having a hard time with life and due to this was let go from my job. I lost my medication when I lost my insurance. I began to spiral and crashed hard about a month ago. When I get depressed I become self destructive. I started drinking heavily, self harm mutilation, and had an affair with a stripper in which I received oral sex. When I sobered up a bit the guilt got to me so much I had to be hospitalized for sucidial thoughts. I am on new medication  (buspar, wellbutrin xl, and rhemron) but still have an issue with guilt and anxiety about the affair and possible std I may have gotten. I cant stay out of my head and still have many suicidal thoughts. I broke down and let my wife know what happened, for her part she is mad but willing to work it out. Any advice would help. Also do any of my meds cause horrible stomach cramps?
