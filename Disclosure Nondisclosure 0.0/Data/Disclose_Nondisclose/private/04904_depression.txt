I went off Effexor 10 years ago. It's one of the hardest drugs to get off...especially off higher does, but it worked for me and others who recommended it.
The capsules for Effexor Extended release are filled with three size granules (for the time release). Open the capsules, pour it into a small dish (like a round pill holder). Take three out- one each size granules. Take the rest. Each week..make sure it's 7 days; do the same thing. Keep going. Yes it takes a while but it's worth it. You won't feel much difference; but don't accelerate it. This medication is more potent then you think. Eventually you will be down to whatever MG it is, I couldn't tell you. you will start to feel some withdrawl effects when you get down to only aout 30 or 40 total granules- but far less than if you just stop or go down from 150 to 75 or 37.5 or whatever it is. You can get through it a lot easier. Eventually they;ll be only three left and you're done. It works, though it takes a time. It took about 6-8 months for me for if your serious about it and want off like I did it's worth it
Good Luck
