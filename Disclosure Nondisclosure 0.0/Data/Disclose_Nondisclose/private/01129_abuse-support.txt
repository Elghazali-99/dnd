m 30 my fiance is 34 I recently went through the history on the computer and found that my fianc√© has been looking at lots of teen porn for the past 4 months. I dont mean 18 year old porn these girls are as young as 14. Not only that but he has been sneaking on to my facebook to go to my nieces profile to look at her photos she just turned 14. He has also been looking at my cousins profile she is 19. He also looked at many youtube videos of young girls dancing sexy as young as 10 wearing bathing suites or revealing clothes. I left to my moms house the next morning with our 6 month old daughter. When i asked him about it he admitted to fantasising about my niece and her friends as well as my cousin. His reason for looking at young teen porn is because he was sick at that time but he would never hurt our daughter or anyone. He says he'll get help but i dont think ill ever trust him with our daughter. Nor do i feel like ill ever trust him. I want to forgive him for the sake of our family i dont want her to have a broken home but is it worth the worry of her safety and my sanity? Please help
