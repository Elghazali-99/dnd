Hi, My 3 year old daughter is very defiant and spirited. she is incredibly loving and very sweet but says no all the time, is very demanding and negotiates constantly. I am aware this is partially her age but on top of this I am almost 6 months pregnant and my new baby's father has just moved in with us so I am sure she is going through a lot. Until recently I felt she was handling all of those things very well but she truly loves my new partner who I have been with for a year and a half and she has known for a year but she often tells him "I love you Mike" and sometimes at a push he will respond with I love you too but more often that not he will not respond to this and change the subject. This worry's me greatly for her stability and when I question him about it he says "I am not going to allow her to manipulate me the way she does you. This is an incredibly hard situation for me as he wants me to discipline her more but although I agree she can be very bratty at times I do not think this is the moment to come down too hard on her. I do oftern tell her if she continues I will put her in her room with no tv and often she continues and I go ahead and do this but he thinks I should not spend so much time putting her to bedd telling stories, singing songs, giving cuddles and I disagree. Please help me understand how to do the best by my daughter right now and how to make my partner understand his love and patience is neede towards her at this moment
