This is so difficult to put into words, I apologise if it's long.
 I'm a 16 year old girl and for the past 2 years I've cried myself to sleep. I self-harmed up until the 3rd February 2013. This was triggered by my cousin dying. I knew the first 6 or so months were grief, however now I know it's not.
 Like I said, every night I cry myself to sleep. I cry multiple times a day and get no good feeling out of crying, no reassurance or getting rid of bad feelings. Anything can trigger crying, but it can be random. I always feel numb inside and often feel like I'm having trouble breathing, like something is crushing me. I often feel like I'm really small and am surrounded. I get scared of what is going on in my head, like I have no control over my thoughts. Every morning I dont want to get out of bed. I just don't want to face another day of feeling like I do. I don't want to tell people because I feel like they'll think somethings wrong with me and they won't understand. I don't want to be diagnosed as mentally ill. I feel constantly as if something bad will happen. 
I feel like I have a lump in my throat and a hole in my heart.
 I really don't want to live like this.
