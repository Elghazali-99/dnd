Hello,
 I have been dating my GF for a little over a year and recently had to relocate for work. The distance isn't huge- about 4 hours apart in the same time zone -but she has not taken to the distance very well. Money is tight for us so it's going to sometimes be hard to pony up for gas or short flights. Its only been a week, but she is having a very difficult time. We are used to seeing each other everyday. She seems to be angry with me a lot, losing her temper, making disparing remarks about me and our relationship. Nothing I say or do seems to help. She only gets more angry. So I'm stuck where I can't openly talk to her about her feelings or possible ways I can help. It feels like she is purposely obtuse and won't let me in. I've tried reacting with anger, sadness, pity, and tried to relate to her situation (which I truly can), all of which have failed. She blames me for leaving her.  Sometimes I see brief moments of hope like: "I want to come see you" but then it's quickly back to: "I'm never going to come see you. EVER. I will not make these easy for you!" How can I help her? Thank you!!
