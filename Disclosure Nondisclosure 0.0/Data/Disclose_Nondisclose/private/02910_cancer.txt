Hi! I'm Diana, 18 yrs old. I always feel tired even though I had no strenous activities for the day. I feel sow eak and I'm having joint pains specially on the lower half of my body. If I slide my finger on the inner side of my forelimbs, I can feel and see "spots" that look like rashes but ont he inner skin. Sometimes there are red spots thatemerge outside or on the surface of my skin. Sometimes I also experiencefrequent burping. Maybe like 2-5 times a month I experience it that for 20 minutes I am continuously burping. Also I experience discomfort on the left side of my stomach or belly. Sometimes it's so severe that I cant move well and can hardly walk. I have irregular menstruation. Sometimes I menstruate twice a month. I also easily catch cold and cough. I had two infections on my pharynx just from the start of this year. I also had bacterial tonsilitis. But the main thing that's bothering me right now is really that i feel so weak all the time and I almost always experience joint pains. And that this is the fifth day I don't have an appetite. I'm forcing myself to eat but when I do, I feel full easily. I've been doubting if I have leukemia and been doing some research. Could these really be signs of leukemia? What should I do?
