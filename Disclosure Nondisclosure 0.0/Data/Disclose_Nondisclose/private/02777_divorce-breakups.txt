After losing our business(I funded), and our house(I funded) we decided to move to cambodia to start a new life. I have two sons he never had children and gave away our favorite dog. As soon as we landed he started being mean to me, you do your thing and I will do mine he said to me. I was devestated that he said that. He was loving and kind and so funny and the best lover. He walked out on me 7 weeks ago after a huge fight that got physical on both of our parts. I freaked out when he packed his things and left. He treats me like he could cre less and finally told me he doesn't ever want to come back. I now am alone, I have a good job abd can make it on my own, but I am so sad. He was a heavy pot smoker and has no ambition, I pushed him to get work, as I had supported the family for the last 5 years. He screwed up at the business, had two car accidents, and I feel like he is responsible for losing the business and house because he was always high. I told him this the night he walked out after he told me I had major anger issues and an alcoholic. I stay home and have a drink or two after work, I don't want to go out partying until 2-4 in the mornings because I have to get up at 6am to teacg every day. He worked partime as a professor at a university here and would start at 3:30PM. I got fed up with his late night antics and toold him so. I have been so upset, I know he isn't seeing anyone, but its just a matter of time. This is a small town and everyone knows what is going on. I don't know if I should leave this town that I love(It was my idea to move to Siem Reap) to avoid seeing him in the future. or go back to the US and struggle with all the problems he left me in financially. My sons want me to move back to Florida and so do my friends. I just started a great job that will enable me to save up money so that I can return to the US with some money in my pocket. What should I do? I hate him for this , but I still miss him.
