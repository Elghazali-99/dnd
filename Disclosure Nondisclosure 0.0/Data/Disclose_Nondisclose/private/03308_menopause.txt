I am 49 and have not had a period in 3 1/2 years.
About 2 years ago I started experiencing an unusual discharge and vaginal irritation. I went to 2 different gynecologists that both thought the problem was a bacterial infection. I was treated with several different meds and at that time nothing really helped. My paps were normal except for the presence of bacteria. ( In fact, on at least one of the paps, no bacteria was present although I was still having symptoms.)
After about a year the problem just stopped. Some months ago I had pain like a very slight period cramp and what looked like very slight spotting.
My doctor tried to perform a biopsy and was unable to get through the cervix so my next step was an ultrasound the results of which are that I have a thickened uterine lining and fluid in the uterus. I just received the test results and am told I have to schedule a hysteroscopy and D&C.  
 It's after hours at the doctor's office so I can't talk to anyone and I'm a little concerned.
What is your opinion of what might be going on here?
Thank You very much,
Denise
