ok last week I was at work and experinced a tingly/numb "wave" that started from my head down to my feet and back up. my heart pounded. I was light headed and I almost fell. it lasted for maybe 3 to 5 seconds. when the ambulance got there they tested my blood sugar and said it was low...(62). I ate something went home but still didn't feel ok.
 2 days later I woke at 4 in the morning because of a pounding heart. I wen to the er and  they did blood work and an ekg. they told me I had a panic attack. they gave me 10 ativan...still hvent taken it as I reall don't think that is the problem.
 last night I had the tingling feeling in my chest and arms I woke up from this and could not move or speek.
 ever since these things have started I have had mild headaches and a sore back/neck. occasionally feel as if my heart has stopped or that I am going to pass out. I am 23 y/o male. about 20 to 25 pounds overweight. is it just a panic attack or something more severe? any help would be great. thank you.
