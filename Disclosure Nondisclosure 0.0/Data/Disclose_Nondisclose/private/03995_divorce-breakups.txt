I had a breakup three weeks ago, and I'm confused ever day. Her reason behind breakup is that she didn't felt anything love & emotional to me and so we decided to break up. The last thing I said to her was that she loves me, deep down, and that the best chance she will ever have will now go away. Then...complete silence. She called me one weekend and we had a fight about some stories behind our break up (third person involved), but she repeatedly said that there is no third person involved. She said to me to get over her. Then silence. Till these few days...she started to be active on Facebook and posted some love songs (one about being scared of breaking up forever, and second one from Coldplay - Violet Hill (if you love me, won't you let me know/why'd you let me go?), and random quotes from famous writers about positive thinking, life, etc. What the hell is going on? What is her condition? She didn't done anything like that and always said to me that I was listening to crybaby songs (Coldplay is one of my favourite bands). I'm not communicating with her, but we are celebrating New Year together (because of the mutual friends). But I really care about her, and I love her, but I know I can't call her or something. 
 Thank you in advance
