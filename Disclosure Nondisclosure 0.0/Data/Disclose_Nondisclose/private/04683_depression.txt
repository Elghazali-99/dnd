Hi Everyone, 
I'm new to the community, and this is my first question. After taking lexapro for about three years, I stopped taking it cold turkey in July because I was gaining weight, which I felt was only adding to my anxiety and depression. I also felt like I was ready to manage my depression and anxiety on my own, rather than with medication. During those three years, I was in college and had access to a psychiatrist and counselor for free.
I felt fine at first, and the withdrawal symptoms were manageable, and I even managed to drop the weight I had gained while taking the medication. Now though, I'm starting to feel my depression and anxiety sneaking back in. I find myself with little energy, falling asleep around 9 or 10 every night, and little focus during the day. My boyfriend says I'm very irritable, like if he says the wrong thing I'll snap at him. I don't know if I should seek out a counselor again, ride out the winter (maybe this is a bit of S.A.D?), or look to find a new medication. (I'm not sure if I really want to be on a medication again, though.) Now that I've graduated, I'm also not sure what my health insurance will cover. 
I'm just looking for some opinions, thank you.
