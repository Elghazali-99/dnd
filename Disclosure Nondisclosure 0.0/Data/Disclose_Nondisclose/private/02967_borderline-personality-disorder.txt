Driessen and others5 used MRI to specifically study the limbic structures of the hippocampus and amygdala. They recruited 21 female patients (aged 21â€“40, mean 29.9 yr) with BPD without comorbid psychotic disorders (i.e., schizophrenia or major depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms as assessed with the DSM-IV) and compared them with control subjects without BPD or other mental illness. Patients with BPD showed significantly reduced volumes of both brain structures (left hemisphere hippocampus reduced 15.7%, right hemisphere hippocampus reduced 15.8%, left hemisphere amygdala reduced 7.9% and right hemisphere amygdala reduced 7.5%). No significant difference in volumes were observed within the groups. BPD patients with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) showed no significant differences from those without PTSD. Mean hippocampal volume was negatively correlated with duration of abuse in the patient's history, and correlations between amygdala volume and duration of abuse were insignificant.
