Recently, i've been noticing that people have a very hard time trying to understand me and that my behavourial patterns are not the same as anyone else i know. A bit ago i had a phase where i was so depressed i couldnt even bring myself to get out of bed in the morning, at the lowest point i really considered it being better if i was dead, then all of a sudden i switched to, and the only way i can describe it, is being on a high, i totally forgot about the bad feeling before, and became a lot more motivated to acheive things, i wrote lists and lists of thing that i wanted to do, then a few weeks later the feeling finished and suddenly got an overwhelming feeling of inability which made me frustrated. I researched the symptoms of bipolar and although i could identify with them, this switch in moods has only happened once so now i am totally confused as to what is wrong, if anything. I'm 15 and i dont want to talk to anyone about it incase they just presume im being an over-dramatic teenager. Plus, i dont want to rely on thier opinion because i don't feel like anybody truly knows me because i rarely let down my guard. So now i'm stuck not knowing what to do about what i'm feeling and not being able to tell anybody about it. And i can feel it starting to get worse, to the point where i've cut myself, but not out of depression, i did it to get attention, i slashed my face so people would ask what had happened, then after i thought 'what normal person does this?' i dont have any limits and always do things without thinking about the consequences, slowly hurting and pushing away the people i love. it scares me.
