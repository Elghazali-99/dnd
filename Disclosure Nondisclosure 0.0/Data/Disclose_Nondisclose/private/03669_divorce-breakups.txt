hi, im an 18 year old male and ive been going through some crap lately. First i lost my job, i worked at a liquor store and they fired me for no reason, i kept asking for a reason and my manager wouldn't give me one. I know i didn't do anything wrong and what bothers me is she hired new people and kept the people that were there when i was there. Am i a screw up? also my girlfriend left me and she treated me like crap towards the end, she lied to me and pretended everything was fine and then she ignored me for a week and dumped me when i questioned her, we mostly texted and never did phone calls. I was with her for 3 months but i only seen her once a week, maybe i get attached to easy, but i cared about her so much and she said shes been hurt before and turns around and hurts me, it just doesn't make sense. So i was diagnosed with GAD and i can't really seem to focus or remember things well, and i just feel like its limiting me and pulling me down. Right now im just drinking myself to sleep every night. I keep having dreams about my ex and i feel sad for the whole day, I started cutting myself with a steak knife and i just want to end things so badly. All i wanted was love, i didn't care about sex or any of that. Girls always call me cute and everyone says im a very good looking guy. But yet i still have low self esteem.
