During the end of year 2005, I was going through a very deep emotional setback.You can say I went deeply into deprenssion.During this time, I was staying in a PG.One night around 3am, I got a call from my room mate saying she is standing outside and since its too dark outside she is scared and wants me to open the door immediately.
I woke up, switched on the lights and opened the door.As soon as I opened the door, I couldnt see anybody outside and it was pitch dark.I called my friend by her name and suddenly she came running from the dark and stood right in front of me.I got scared as she appeared suddenly from dark and she was also wearing a black dress.She came in scared and told me that she saw somebody running towards the bushes in the house garden in front of our house.I heard that consoled her and slept off.While I was sleeping, i got a feeling that my room mate has suddenly gotten up and is trying to strangle me.Although I was asleep, I couldnt move my hands or feet and couldnt even breathe properly.I started chanting god's name and suddenly I felt freed.I turned and looked at my room mate's bed and she was quietly lying asleep.After that a sudden fear came into my mind and I couldnt close my eyes after that.After a few days, I started feeling a presence of one lady wearing a Burqa (Black dress worn by Muslim Ladies) sitting next to me.I would feel her presence everywhere I would go.I couldnt sleep for days and had to switch on the light while in the nights.Slowly I started requesting my other PG mates to sleep with me.I couldnt sleep alone.This lady would always keep staring me.I could make out it was not for real and it was just that I am assuming it to be there.From naked eyes I couldnt see her just her presence.I even stayed at my cousin's place for 1 month to come over it.Later I felt I had to give something to a poor to get rid of that Muslim lady.I did that and may be psychologically gathered all energy and got rid of that feeling some how finally by Aprill 2006.Since then I have never come across that feeling but a fear is there and I keep thinking what it was though I have netver come across that thing again.I keep getting scared at the thought if I had a schezophrenic attack and if it can again come up ? Kindly help !
