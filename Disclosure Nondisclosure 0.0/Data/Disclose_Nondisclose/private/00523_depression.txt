Hello everyone I'm 19 years old and I have a 4 year old girl and a 3 month baby that I'm breast feeding.... When I was 8 months pregnant I started feeling alone. I started eating more than usual. At first I thought it was due to the pregnancy. But now his about to be 4 months and I'm getting worst. Everytime I'm feeling sad or down or just had an argument with my husband I get this anxity and can't control my self and start eating. And I mean eating a lot. Just last Friday I bought two pizzas and I ate one whole pizza and like four slizes from  the other box. Before I was even pregnant with my boy I remember I couldn't eat more than 4.... and then after eating so much I feel so guilty and don't want to eat at all... and after a day of only eating fruit water or even nothing I do the same thing. 
 What is this called? If their is even a word for... I've been feeling so fat, ugly, and I just hate my body.... what can I do to get out of this problem?  And should I just stop feeding my child and just give him formula???? PLEASE HELP ME!!!!
