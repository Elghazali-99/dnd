I was very happly married for 30 years and one day my husband just said I not in love with you anymore, I had no idea he was unhappy. I am crushed and I seem to walk around in circles all day thinking why? How could this happen, I think he is sleeping with the 22 year tart two doors down. He is very cold and angry to me know, I wonder what he is thinking, if there are any men out there who have been through this please explain what is going on. My husband lost his dad 1 year ago and I thought he was just sad, I tried to talking to him but nothing.  He drinks a lot now and smokes which he never did. The girl he is hanging around already has a child to some man and she drinks a lot and smokes and she has very little friends because she tends to sleep with friends partners. I am confused people say it is a mid life crisis (he is 47). So do I wait for him? When do I contact him? Or do I wait for him to contact me? Will he get over this? Do I move on with my life without him? If anyone can give me any information I would appreciate it....Thanks
