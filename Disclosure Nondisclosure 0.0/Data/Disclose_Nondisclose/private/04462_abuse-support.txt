What is the difference in verbal or emotional abuse? I think my husband does both.It has gotten worse with each passing year. We have 3 sons ,(he is teaching them hoe to treat women, by them viewing how he treats me) I worry about that alot. I know I need to leave him, I think I will be happier, I am having surgery in 2 days, am staying with mother to recoop.( of corse this pissed him off) I am a certified nurses aide so I can make enough to support myself, although it will not be in the life style i am accustomed to. My hubby makes a lot of money, I am very ready to get divorced, I worry about my kids, the 11 yr old is coming with me. Do the 15 and 17 year old have the right to decide for their selves? God I want my life back, I dream of living a simple life, a small house, simple pleasures, and tranquility. 
The abuse I have put up with, everything I do is wrong, I get called vild profane names daily. He screams in my face.If I do 100 things right he ******* about the 1 I did wrong. the list of rules I must live by is long. I have been cut off from friends, the right to spend money, the right to make choices like decorating  Our home, or what to cook for dinner. If I tell the kids "no" he will over ride me and say yes, all of this happens in front of them. I am angry with my self for not getting out sooner, I am returning to work as soon as healed from surgery, then seeing lawyer. I want to try to keep house till youngest graduates, the sell and move into something smaller.
I do not deserve this, I am decent looking for 46, I have a lot of faith in God, I am a humanitarian, I care about being good and kind. this is why I love my job so much, I have a real need to be appreciated, and at work I am, many patients request me, I listen and try to do the little things to ease their pain.
I think I will never be involved in a relationship again--I want time to get my back bone back, and enjoy my kids whike they are still young.
