I talked about my 'problem' to somebody for the first time , first time in almost 18 years, And I am 23, 
I never talked about it before because I was fine with it, I had had plenty of time to get over the issue, forgive and forget. But I had never spoken of it to anyone until this guy showed up, I don't know why I did it, we've been good friends for just over a month and I can't believe I trusted him enough to tell him this even though I have never talked about it ... not even to my closest pal, whats wrong with me??? And now I keep thinking about this issue, it wasnt helpful talking about it, ... not at all....I feel sick and dirty and it feels like I've opened an old wound by recollecting the past, I shouldve let sleeping dogs lie...maybe because before yesterday, he would message every hour and well just be very communicative, and now its been almost 24 hours and Ive heard nothing from him, I am sure Ive given him a load to chew on, he must be uncomfortable and thinking oh god what have I got myself into, Im not sure Id have reacted the same way, I actually don't feel so good about myself, a part of me doesnt want to see him again, but I like him a lot, I trust him somehow, but I don't want to face him because he now knows what no other soul knows....isn't it strange? I am learning new things about myself... I never thought I'd be so melancholy about it, I thought I was past it. I am a student, my exams are on my head and all I can think about it is yesterday, my sick story, its affect on my relationship with this fellow and just that... I want to run away somewhere, far far away....
