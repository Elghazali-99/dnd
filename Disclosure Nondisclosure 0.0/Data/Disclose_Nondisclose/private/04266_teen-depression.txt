So I don't really know what's going on. I'm a 16 year old girl.  I've been feeling sad for no good reason lately.  I don't ever want to get out of bed, but when I do go to bed I can't sleep. I cry all the time.  The people in my life I have always wanted to talk to I now can't stand.  I feel like I hate my friends.  I hate myself.  I don't really think I'm a good person.  Everyday I think of a way I could die or kill myself or something.  I've been feeling used by everyone I thought I loved.  I'm just sad all the time.  I cut myself.  I don't want anyone to find out. I don't do it in places people generally see. I don't really know why I started but now I'm addicted...and the worst part about it is that I don't really see whats wrong with it.  If it makes me feel good why shouldn't I? Things I used to like don't make me happy anymore.  My friends make me angry. Everyone makes me angry.  I think I might be bipolar, I told my mom but she seemed to think I wasn't and that every teenager goes through this. Not the cutting part cuz she doesn't know about that. But anyways my questions are:
Am I just a teenager and just need to suck it up? AND Why is cutting bad?
