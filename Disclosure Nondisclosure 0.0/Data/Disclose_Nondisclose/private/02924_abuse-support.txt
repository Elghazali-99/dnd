Hello, I am a 48. Been married for 27 years. My kids are all grown and out of the house. I love my husband but lately I wonder if the love is returned. My husband owns his own business and is a work-a-holic, he leaves the house at 8:00 am and is never home before 11:00 pm and usually after that. I have asked myself if I am being emotionaly abused and I know since I have to ask that the answer is most likely yes. He is constantly putting me down, i.e. I am not a good cook, I don't keep the house clean enough, basically anything I do is not good enough. I might see him for 10 minutes a day and all he does is talk down to me. We do take vacations once a year, always with other people and that is supposed to hold me on time with him. The sad and confusing part is that I get angry that he doesn't come home, but, then on those rare ocassions that he does come home at a decent hour I hate it when he pulls in the driveway. I have a part time job, and the money I make goes to paying the bills, I don't have a clue how much money he has as he has totally excluded me from the business. He complains all the time about being so busy and far behind and I offer to come and help and he says no I don't need your help you don't know how to do what needs to be done....If I ask him ?'s about anything he bites my head off, if I try to talk to him he acts like I am bothering him. For the past week I just have not talked to him, and he seems to like it.... I am really considering leaving, but at this point I have no money and no where to go...... I am angry and very unhappy, have no ambition to do anything, no desire to talk to anyone, been off work from an injury and I have not left my house in 2 weeks.....thanks for taking the time to read....
