Hi,
Since the last 8-9 months, every day I've been having loose, unformed stools (not watery, type 6, rarely borderline 7), I go once or twice max, in spite of when I go, what I eat.
 If I go twice a day, it IS loose. 
If I go once in 24 hours, it's slightly soft in the beginning, but mushy at the end.
 This is weird coz for the first 32 years of my life, I have struggled with hard stools and even anal fissures.
 Now I am scared - could this be cancer?
 I have NO other symptoms like pain, blood in stools, gas, fatigue, nausea or weight loss (though I have always been underweight)...
 But Google's been scaring me saying a "change in stools" could be a sign of cancer.
 My father is a Doctor and so is my father-in-law, both dont seem worried, one says it's ok, thats just your 'type', and your body may be overcompensating since all these years it was constipated (?!)... my father-in-law says check for... appendicitis?!
 Should I really be worried? The moral dilemma here is going to a Doctor "outside of the family" (anyone who has a Doctor in the family knows how possessive they are about this!)
 It's just that this change in stool after 32 years is what's worrying me.
