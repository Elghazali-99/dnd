i am 21 and with a 30 year old woman with 3 children. we live together. i have alot of jealousy issues. i find myself getting very upset by small things. i get nervous and angry if we pull up to a store and she has to walk by people becuz im afraid of what they might try to say. she is a very attractive woman. but i also feel like i have logical points alot of the time. she says things that should make a bf mad. in my opinion anyway. today she told me how she smiled at two guys at work and one gave her a 5 dollar tip. and then she says shes gonna have to use her smile more. and im thinking why would u tell me that? i mean i know she has to associate with people at a job but why tell me u smiled at two random guys and got a tip from one? there was obviously flirting going on. thats how i see it.  but i do know i get overly paranoid. is it becuz of a personality disorder? or the fact that she already has 3 kids by 2 different guys that is bugging me deep down? or because of the sometimes obvious stuff that she says. i just want to know how to fix it. cuz if its me then i dont want to ruin our relationship. anyone who could help id appreciate it. thanks.
