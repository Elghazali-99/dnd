1) He has major temper tantrums about dumb things all the time.
2) He is very moody with extreme mood swings. Sometimes he's in a good mood and everything is all good. 10 minutes later something can set him off and he'll be miserable and angry for several hours.
3)Very low self esteem
4) When my mom finally threatened him for divorce, my dad looked desperate to stay in the relationship, which came as a huge shock to me being that he is always degrading my mom and speaking terribly of her and her family to me behind her back and often to her face. Why does he so want her so badly all of a sudden?
5) He is just a very irrational person in generall, and especially so with certain things.
6) He can be very childesh and immature at times.
7) He is very controlling
8) He has bad social skills
9) He doesn't  get along with his boss at all
10) I feel really bad writing these things about my father, but I feel like at this point in my life, I'm entitled to know if and what kind issues he has.
