I feel neither dead nor alive. Rejection has been the theme of my life and the pain is not aleveated with medications nor therapy with psychologists or social workers. I've been at this 25 years. How do I accept the pain and integrate it into my life? At this point I have chosen to just hold up in my house and be alone. I do NOT have a desire to be suicidal, I just had my brother commit suicide and I can not do that to my family though they do not truly care about me. I am alone in life, and have lost all my non-on-line friends due to my depression and traumatization after he died. So  . . . now I just feel Like to stop being a burden to others I must leave them and say good-bye and just life alone with the pain and my dog and just survive somehow. How do I make it? i'VE TRIED IT ALL!!!!! There seems to be no end in site. . .. .I can try to distract myself, I can try to do opposite behaviors, I can try to inquire about my thoughts and I can try cognitive mental therapy and nothing elevates the pain. I think all I can is embrace the pain and accept it. I see no other way. I truly have been trying for 25 years in therapy and am not just whining. I need practical advice. The therapy they say will help - just doesn't. I know they all are trying very hard to help me and are sincere. But it's just not working. I think all I can do is live with the pain. But how do I do that?
