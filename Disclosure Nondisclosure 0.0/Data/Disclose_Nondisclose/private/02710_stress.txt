Okay, I've had anxiety off and on since middle school, I'm now a senior in college, but until recently it hadn't been too bad, I've been under a lot of stress, causing worsened anxiety, and for the last year or so I have hardly been active at all, I'm wondering if I've totally screwed myself physically because at the slightest thing I'm carrying upstairs my heart races and sometimes pounds, and off and on my heart will skip beats, my doctor wasn't super concerned about this because I haven't really had any dizziness or anything with it and my last EKG  came out normal, I'm just curious if these symptoms, along with a lot of leg weakness, it isn't constant, mostly when I go to stand up, or when I'm even just laying in bed and switch my legs around they feel weird and weak, could this just be from so much time of no exercise and just laying in bed or does anyone think all these symptoms are something worse that need to be addressed by my doctor? I'm almost convinced it's just a mixture of anxiety and lack of exercise, I know your mind can play crazy tricks on you, but it's still concerning to me.
