I just wish I had someone to connect to, someone who wanted to be with me, to understand me. 
A friend. 
It seems simple. 
It shouldn't be hard to make a friend. 
Except it is. 
People know I'm not right.
They avoid me. 
Or maybe it's really me doing my best to ward them off. 
Either way. 
I'm alone. 
I feel unwanted. 
Hollow. 
I don't fit in, no matter how hard I wish or try. 
I'm a lone wolf, and lone wolves never survive. 
They slowly die a lonely death, which is exactly what I'm doing to myself.
I want nothing more than to be loved, wanted, needed, and accepted. 
Except, I don't deserve it. 
I destroy everything I touch. 
I think I should go down by myself. Peacefully. 
I shouldn't selfishly drag everyone down with me. 
I'm sick of trying when no matter what I do I always come back with the same results. 
This hopeless, never ending path of nothing just isn't worth traveling. 
It's too hard to get up and sweep away the sand from my tired knees. 
I just wish to rest my head and close my eyes.
To drift off into eternity where I can finally be happy.
