My 13 year old son thinks I chose my fiance over him. I have been a single mom & lived @ my parents house. I just recently purchased a brand new home w/ my fiance & his child in April. It was hard for all of us to adjust to eachothers ways & schedules.I can admit me & my fiance were arguing quite often about the littlest things. My son would go to his dads house every other weekends also. We had only lived in the house for 3 weeks & My son went & tld his dad there was arguing in the home & my sons dad served me w/ ex parte papers.  We go to court & court recommends supervised visits & also if I would like to havemy son that I would move out of my home & back to my parents house. I was tld by my son that his dad has told him that he wont be able to see me for 2 yrs if he dont tell the court that I need help & need supervised visits.My son says I chose my fiance cuz I wouldve moved to my parents. My son says he dont want to have supervised visits but his dad tld him its me who wants it. I have been seeing my son in supervised visits but its really hard & do feel my son is unhappy there. My fiance & i have stopeed our arguing & our relationship has gotten better, but I still want my son in my life . I went to my sons football game a few months ago & his father told him dont look at your mom or talk to your mom because she dont care about you & my son listened to his dad.I told the court my sons dad brainwashes my son & the father argues that he does not . My sons dad is making my son believe i, a bad ,pther & making my son believe that I chose my fiance over my son.I dont know what alse to do & dont want him to feel that i chose my fiance
