My husband and I just found out tonight that my 12 year old step son (whom I have legally adopted within the last 4 years) asked our 4 year old son to suck his ding ****.  After questioning our 4 year old and our 12 year old they indicated that the situation happened and that our 12 year old had forced our 4 year old to do this. Initially this questioning started when our 4 year old asked me if I was going to suck Daddy's ding **** because big brother made me suck his ding ****.  After our complete shock and anger....we weren't sure where to go from there.  My husband and I were so upset that we called my husbands parents to come get the 12 year old and remove him from our house as quickly as possible so we could figure out what to do.  The 12 year old is showing no remorse over what happened and our 4 year old is worried that big brother is getting in trouble.  I read on line that if the abuser is 12 or over we have to report this incident.  I don't even know how to do that-and at this point I don't even want my step son anywhere near our other 3 children.  What should I do now??? I love my step-son but I can't take the risk that he may try this behavior again.
