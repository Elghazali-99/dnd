About 5 years ago ( I was 16)  I was diagnosed with social anxiety, depression and a bit of OCD. I was put on Zoloft at 50mg and I could see an immediate improvement but after a year I felt like I had dipped so my psychiatrist put me up to 100 mg. Again I saw an immediate improvement and was happy with life. I went through my last year of school on a high, but noticed that during stressful times I would need a little bit more sleep, about 2-3 hours, which didn't bother me. I then started university and became stressed and anxious again and I was prescribed Venlor at 75mg to just calm my anxiousness. But now I am suffering from excessive sleeping. I often go to bed at 6pm and will wake up at 6am go to the toilet and sleep again until 1-2pm. I can then get up and go eat and at around 4 have a nap until 6 and eat repeat the whole cycle. This is really taking a toll on me as I am actually becoming depressed because the amount of sleep I am having. I have exceptionally vivid dreams and will find myself wanting to go back to sleep to finish a dream. 
I don't feel lethargic during the day I just want to sleep, I have zero drive to get up. I don't feel rested when I wake up and it's really starting to hinder my studies. 
 If anyone has any idea why this is happening or how to fix it please can you help because I really feel like reality and my dreams are merging. 
 Thank you
