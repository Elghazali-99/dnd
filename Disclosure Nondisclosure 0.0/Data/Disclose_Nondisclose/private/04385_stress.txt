I was in the hospital last November for a bad ulcerative colitis infection.  In the beginning of January, I started noticing that I started losing a lot of my hair...it is now February and it hasn't stopped. It keeps on falling out in clumps.  I was tested for a low thyroid and anemia and they all came out fine. I was taking medications when I got out of the hospital...(I was on Prednisone and Asacol.) Then, I stopped taken both of these medications in the beginning of December and haven't been on anything else since. So, I don't think those medications could of triggered my hair loss because it didn't happen until I got off of the Prednisone and Asacol. I noticed my hair follicle feels very delicate and sensitive...like it's hanging by it's threads and ready to come out of my scalp. My hair also feels gummy. Do you know what could be causing this. I was reading that a major infection could cause "Telogen Effluvium" and I was maybe thinking that this is why I am losing my hair BUT why would my hair follices feel very weak and delicate and why would my hair feel gummy when I never had this before my hair loss. Can "Telogen Effluvium" cause some kind of sensitivy and change my hair texture??? Whatever it is totally changed the way my scalp and hair feels.  By the way, when my hair falls out, it has a white bulb at the end of the follicle. So, I don't think I have any type of fungus as I am aware that fungus breaks off near the roots.
