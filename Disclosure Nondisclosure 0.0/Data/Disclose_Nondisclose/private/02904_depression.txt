I found out about a week ago that my husband has been having an emotional affair online with a women in america, we live in australia. I was deverstated when I found out as we have only been married for  less than 2yrs. I thought that maybe something was going on like depression but I never thought that things were this bad with him. He's very distant, always tired, doesn't eat much, only sleeps about 4-5hrs every night, always acheing like his back, shoulders, stomach, he can't concerntrate, he's very dull in his expression and looks. I'v tried to talk to him about the situation and he says that he feels fine and that there is nothing wrong with him. There is a very strong mental health problem on his mothers side of the family and that makes me think he has depression. I want to stay with him because I know that the emotional affair is not the real problem. We have been togethre for a total of 5yrs and he was never like this. What do you suggest I do to help him realise that he has depression?
