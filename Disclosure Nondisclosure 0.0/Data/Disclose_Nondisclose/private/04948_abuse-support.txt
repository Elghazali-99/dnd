My life is never dull ya know...my ex is crazy..he just scooped away my sweet boys in an angry hast after telling me to go F&*$K myself I dont know how mant times , as well as saying he would blow my F*@$%ing head off. All in front of my kids. Hes especially irrated today,  as I would not comply with his demands earlier today. He wanted the boys at 10am, I told him that was too early, so he said fine NOON..but my oldest was so upset that he begged me to not let them get picked up four hours earlier. So I called him back & said we had plans & he would have to wait until normal time & come get them then. He spewed some foul comments at me & I hung up. When he showed up, he was peaked in anger. I had told the kids that I would speak to him about "his smoking" in the car with them. These boys has never had anyone smoke in the house or car, and even though we had both smoked our whole marriage, it was never inside or in the car. As soon as I asked him about it...he lied to my face, as he always does..then the six year old piped in & said Yeah you do Daddy.he screamed at him that he didnt and that that was enuf ! Then my 10 year old also said : Dad you do"...well he lost it I suppose. I said theres no need to lie to all of us, just please respect their lungs & dont smoke in the car. Well thats when he began verbally abusing me calling me a bi@ch, telling me to stay out of his " bleep bleep life etc..I told him they were my kids & he must repsect them if only for the four days a mth he has them. Then he continued on verbally abusing me...kids close by...I begged him to stop as the kids were there , but he ddnt,  he finished it with a statement about " blowing my F^&@king head off". I couldnt even believe he said that! Wow. I always knew he was unstable, but he seems to have hit rock bottom. When I left him he has never gotten over it & after stalking me & begging me to take him back for many months..he met a g/f & turned 100% anger towards me like Ive never seen..scaring me more then once in the past 1 3/4yrs.
I told him to I would call the police, he said " go ahead, Im not touchin you".. I didnt want  he kids in that scene again as they have already witnessed the police in a silimalr situation before with us. So I waited & did, they just left. They said they would check on him & ensure the safty of my children for me & call me later..also stating facts about court etc that I already know. Yes I need to go to court, maybe have his rights even more limited.crazy a$$ ! I pray my kids are OK this weekend !!
I should just learn not to speak when hes near, its always so explosive !...but today was the worst!
