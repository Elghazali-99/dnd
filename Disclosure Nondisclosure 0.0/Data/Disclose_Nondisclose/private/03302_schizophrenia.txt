My elderly mother is in a nursing home in the memory support unit for those with dementia related issues. She has paranoid schizophrenia and is resisting bathing, likely her form of protesting being in the nursing home. She hasn't bathed in the 16 days since she'd been transferred there (from another nursing home she'd been at for a year) and is getting rather rank smelling. They would like to administer a sedative so she can be bathed, but the catch is that the nursing home says they can't force her to bathe or take meds, the definition of force being physically open her mouth for oral meds or hold her down for an injection. So far she hasn't been able to be reasoned with. My guardianship coordinator told me that they can put meds in her food without telling here they're there. The idea is to administer meds in a way that does not create a traumatic experience. 
 She doesn't eat much, so anything mixed in food or drink would have to be flavor neutral or palatable. 
 I was wondering if there is a sedative patch or some other way of sedating her per the above parameters so that she can be bathed? I'm looking for "outside of the box" thinking here. Any ideas would be appreciated.
