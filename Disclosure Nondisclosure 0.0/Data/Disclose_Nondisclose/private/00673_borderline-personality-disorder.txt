A few changes at work and I and many others are not happy. I feel quite anxious and may need support. 
 I am always anxious and wonder what i've done wrong and who'se going to spot it. I cant seem to get little details quite right with my reports no matter how many times i check. I think boss is talking about me and being negative (he's been giving out weired vibes we used to get on fine before changes). I've developped a twitch in my left eye for the last several weeks. Always tired.  Have OCD.
 In my adolescence and teen years i used to be very moody. Would be very 'off' in the morning and get better during the day (patient best friends). Didnt speak to most other class mates except ones in my group. Was either depressed or sometimes very hyper and happy for silly small reasons. 
 I've changed now and try to always smile and chat to others. Still, I'm quite jealous and envious about people and have bad will white pretending to be good. I bear grudges long. I complain about everyone to everyone else except a few people who i absolutely love and never say anything bad about them even if they do something bad support them. I am quite fake. I am ashamed of this but cant stop. Cant stop saying negative things, i've tried a few times. Still people are drawn to me, those who are difficult with others speak and get on well with me (even when I've not said anything bad about people they dont like). But as luck would have it I dont get on with people i need to make work life easier.
 Why am i such a crappy person. what is wrong with me?
