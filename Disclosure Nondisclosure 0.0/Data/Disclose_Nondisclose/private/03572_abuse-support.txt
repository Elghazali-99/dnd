In Sept 2005 my daughter had a son that year and had a live in boyfriend who eventually fractured my grandsons skull which led to my daughter losing her son and being brought up by his paternal grandparents,since that time I have continually had to supervise my daughter with her son,It was not her fault just a wrong bloke who couldnt admit to not coping with a baby,I get no money or support from social services for petrol as he lives 8 miles away and its controlled times and in holidays it can be 6 hrs for 3 days,I am a carer for my other daughter for many years and that was not even taken into consideration at the time,The other grandparents bring him up and has a residents order so social services as closed the case now..I have had letters done by doctors which I  have paid for to say I cannot do this supervision anymore but no one listens..is there a way that social services can be made to drop this supervision order and let his mum have him back now as she is more mature and settled now with someone and not with any abusive partners no more,she has felt bad about what that ex done to her baby he dropped him he said by mistake 3 times in different circumstances,he was never charged but my daughter has to live with the cost of not having her son with her no more,she has never harmed her son in any form and has done what they said in the past been to parenting classes etc none of it does any good,They just made sure they have nothing more to do with the case by closing it and making my life worse..If my daughter had her son back I would just walk to hers instead of driving to get him and take him back on my expenses which we do not have and not reconpense either,we cannot have a holiday cos i cant afford it with the petrol and running around expenses of supervising.and paying to go in places cos i am supervising..in a day i have to travel 32 miles in one day and for supervising its disgusting what we have to pay for when we cant afford it,I have paltrey carers allowance and my husband is on jobseekers I pay the bills on what we get for my daughter as we wouldnt be able to live or even pay any bills..
