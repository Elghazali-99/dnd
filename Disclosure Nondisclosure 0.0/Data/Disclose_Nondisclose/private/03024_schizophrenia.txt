Okay, so I was doing a schizophrenia screening quiz just for curiosity online and only one out of the rest matched the screening test questions and that is the part that asks if I ever confuse imaginations with reality and I said yes to it, So when I confused an imagination or thought ; I meant that I had an imagination that made me wonder whether or not I just thought about doing something or if I actually did it, for example, one time I thought; Did I go to the basement one time a few days ago or did I just imagine going to the basement? this happened once from a dream too where I had a vivid dream that I thought it really happened (I had a dream about my friend putting on a watch and I thought it really happened for a second) but later realized it was just a dream. 
 Keep in mind that these rarely happen to me as they only happened about 7 times throughout my entire life and I don't have hallucinations, delusions, or any other symptoms related to schizophrenia (my only conditions are hypochondria, OCD, and ADHD) and my questions are: 
 1. Did any of you guys experience what I listed above and don't have schizophrenia while experiencing confusing imaginations with reality at times? 
 2. Do I have Schizophrenia based on this one symptom or experience? Although I need to see a psychiatrist for a diagnosis, but based on this observable information I posted, do I have Schizophrenia?
 I am absolutely terrified and I don't want to develop schizophrenia. Thank you!
