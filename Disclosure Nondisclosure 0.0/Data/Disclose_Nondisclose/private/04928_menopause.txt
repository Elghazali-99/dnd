Hi hoping for some help. the only reason I can even type is because I am now taking 100 mg topammax daily and cambia 25 mg 2xs daily which takes the edge off the headache but it is still theres for 19 days now. O 3/5 all was fine, at 315 I walked to my sons bus stop and out of the blue got this pain that came up the back of my neck and to the top of both sides of my head that was SO intense I was certain I was having a stroke. NEVER felt this pain in my life. Taken by ambulance to ER. had CT showed frontal lobe abnormalties they gave me iv meds sent me home to follow up with neuro. Had Family dr apt 2days later as I was combing hair that morning same thing happened again that quick sudden stabbing pain, went to ER again mri showed same thing abnormalties no bleeds or aneurysms though. Again they gave meds called it a headaches. Finally see neuro a few days later he says it menopausal migraines gives me Topamax 50 mg, a few days later im back to see him crying because I cant take the pain and am not convinced it even a migraine. Im not sensitive to light and noise I just have this unbearable front head pain. He says your almost 50, its menopause go home double your dose. Now im on day 19, walking around like a zombie on these pills and STILL have a bad headache, no im NOT crying or needing to go to the ER but I am in pain...Im at a loss already....my next step is a sleep study...I do snore bad and my hubby says I stop breathing, anyone ever hear of headaches like this from apnea or experience anything like this from something else? My family Dr is setting me up with a specialist in Philadelphia and hopefully I can get some answers im just lost already, according to the written reports it could very well be a disease like MS but this neurologist just laughs at that and says your almost 50..wth does that mean???  TIA for any help =)
