I suspect my spouse has a mild form of Bipolar Disorder that may be starting to worsen. I can't get him to seek help to see if he has a mood disorder. I need to know what I should do here. 2 incidents occurred, where my spouse accused me of purposely spilling some cat remedy on garage floor to clean up. He was adamant that I laid this out for him to clean up. He yelled and hollered told me what a lazy person I was and bad wife and that I just sat on my *** all day...I am disabled, but I will tell you that lazy nowhere near describes me. I argued with him told him how crazy he was sounding, and that I did not do what he accused me of. I had given my cat some fur remedy, but she may have vomited out some on the floor as I never saw what he described. He insisted I apologize for something I didnt do which I refused...Minutes later, he was mellow and trying to get on my good side. A little too late.
 A few days later I was at an event that had me out of town (working) for 3 days. he was okay with it. I didn't see the big deal since he leaves whenever he feels like it and spends money on himself like no tomorrow. Anyway, upon return he yelled and hollered "he wanted a divorce" if I went off somewhere for 3 days again. I was at a relatives by the way during this work excursion. I was shocked at his behavior and of course defended my positiion which only angered him more. He continued to yell, "I want a divorce" and was shaking. I told him he was completely out of line, and I no longer wished to continue to the dialogue as it was going. Again, after he was apologetic which I was pissed and feeling like I was about to land in the hospital from such stress with his behavior.
 Question is is this abuse? Also, should I go to my work event of 3 days despite his demands that if I do he will divorce me. Mind you, a month ago, he was aware this is what I was going to do and said no problem.
 very confused
