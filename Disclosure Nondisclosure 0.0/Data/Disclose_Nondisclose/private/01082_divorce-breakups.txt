My empathy to all of you in your sad and life shattering circumstances. Mine is no big surprise judging by what I've read.  Husband doesn' t love me anymore....again. (Yes...shame on me for trying the first time to have him realize just what he was giving up. He did I thought...)  
Married 29 years, 3 children now adults, one with severe psychological and physical problems, unable to work or support himself after years of therapy and use of medications.  I totally understand the stress of this over the past 15 years, but I can't just leave my son without any support.  Husband finally told me he doesn't believe our son is really that bad and that he has to just "get out there and get a job". He told me today that I chose to marry him, but the kids were just "biological outcomes". I am to choose between him and the kids.
Can anyone out there tell me how I am supposed to make that decision?  He hasn't wasted any time waiting for my answer as I discovered he has a "match" from an online dating site. (He is unaware that I know as I found very torredly romantic messages from them back and forth). Apparently they have been very "connected" for many months. He had been telling me he plans to take his cheque (a very sizable one) from his new contract work and "fly away".  Now it all makes sense as this woman lives in another country. He had a "safety net" the last time he "slam dunked" me 15 years ago as well (my counsellor's terms for the "other woman" from my sessions at that time).
I am devastated as he promised he would never leave me again, and now he is going to not only leave me but destroy his son.
Please help me resolve this in my own mind so that I can go on. I'm in my late 50's and must find a way to support myself and my son.  
I so wanted to grow old with the man I married, but I don't know where he went.
