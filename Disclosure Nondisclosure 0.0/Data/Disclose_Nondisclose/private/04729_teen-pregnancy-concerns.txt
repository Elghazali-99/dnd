:shock: 
Hi last week I had oral sex for the first time. We did 69 two times, after each I washed my mouth with water and a bit of toothpaste ( I dint brush though.. was that even necessary to avoid pregnancy? Is it posible for sperm to travel from mouth to vagina during oral, after I swallowed Soren, kissed him and he gave me oral?... I think not but my guess is that saliva has a similar PH to the vago and plus it's warm and moist? ) I was also careful not to touch anything with my hands that had sperm.. except my panties to put them on... oh no!
 And ever since my breasts have been hurting! Maybe he was rough when he sucked them ? Maybe it's because my period should come in four days... could it be a nipple infection??? It doesn't hurt super bad but it sores often and I'm worried. 
  Mmm i don't know, what do you think about it? I know I should've used a condom but we've been together for almost two years and we haven't noticed anything. 
  I don't want to fall into a "pregnancy scare" because I'm really battling with OCD I just want to make sure I'm having safe sex, and that my breastst are ok.. thanks so much for the time and attention to anyone who helps me :)
