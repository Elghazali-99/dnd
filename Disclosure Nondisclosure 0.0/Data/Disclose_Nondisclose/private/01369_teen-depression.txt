I dont even know where to begin.  My teenage daughter has been failing school since 6th grade. I blamed it on my relationship with her father which has since ended and life is well normal.  I have remarried and well she likes my new husband so I dont think that is it.  She is saying she is not happy and well I have done a number of things to get her to understand that school is important.  I have taken away all her priveleges,she pretty much has nothing.  She is supposed to bring home her grade slips and she forgets so I took her cur;ling iron away for the weekend,she doesnt seem to care its as if anything I do doesnt matter she will make the best of any of it, so its hardly a punishment she still doesnt do what she is supposed to.  She seems to care about her friends more than anyone else.  She is mouthy to teachers and she recently got in trouble on the bus for her attitude.  I just dont know what else to do.  She is sad alot of the time and I just dont get it.  I cant help her,she says nothing makes her happy and as far as her grades she always tells me she is trying but im not seeing much of that
