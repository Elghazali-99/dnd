Hello everybody,
 I have been married for a year to my 30 year old husband. I am 22. We have a beautiful 8 month old baby girl. I got pregnant when we were engaged, only a few months after we started dating. Our history with arguments has been really bad. My husband suffered a loved one's death 14 years ago that he had to witness when he was only 15. His little brother was 12 and got run over in front of him. After this, his mother blamed it on him and his parents were constantlu fighting and lying to each other and eventually got a divorce. When I met him, he was an alcoholic gambler and had nothing going for him. Now, my great parents have helped us with everything and gave us a store for us to run. We have a nice condo and everything he never had. I am a college student, a mother, and a wife. He lies a lot to get out of trouble, and when I find out, I get mad. He gets angrier than me and we have had bad fights where I slapped him and he shoved me, among other things. My stuff has been broken by him. Today, I found out he was lying about a bank account he has been keeping from me. I ignored him until he called me a ***** and I slapped him. He threw my purse on the ground and shoved me. I called the cops and they just gave us a warning and I came to my mom's house and he is somewhere. When we are good, we are great, but our fights are out of control. Now he is telling me he can't do this anymore, which he has done before, and after 2 days he cried for me to come back. He says heoves me more than anything and wanted to be with me forever. When we aren't fighting, he kisses the ground I walk ok n. Now he wants to leave me instead of work on our marriage. What should I do? I can't stop crying or thinking about it.
I forgot to mention, he drinks when he is angry and gets worse.
