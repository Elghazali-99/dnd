Right a friend of mine has going SERIOUSLY downhill this past month, she wasn't and still isn't the smartest of people.
Well she met her half brother and her half sister and now since then she has been going downhill, she has apparently been smoking cannabis and skipping school to go see her brother and her boyfriend (Who got her into cannabis). A couple of weekends ago she went missing and i rang her, she picked her phone up and since then hung up on me.
I sent her a text message saying "It's Ben answer your phone i need to speak to you." as i was worried about her safety, so i rang her again and she just let it ring. I sent her another message saying "Look if you don't answer your phone you will loose one of your closest friends!" i rang her once more and she had turned her phone off i knew the message went through as i have a delivery report sent to my phone when text's are received! I sent another text for when she turned her phone on saying "Well it seems you have lost me as a friend..."!! Now she has been skipping school for the past 3 weeks, I met up with a friend of mine and mentioned my friends name "Daniella" and she said oh i know her brother "Freeman" then i was kind of shocked. So i said find out why she didn't reply to my text's if you can please....Well about 2 hours ago i got a text off of her saying she's ignoring me because i sent her indecent text's, i was hurt at this and felt anger towards her. i will be having some very strong words with her in a couple of hours as i am not getting accused of things on that level!!! 
 This is the WORST she has been, the police has cuffed her to bring her back home, she has assaulted her mum, and had her mum in tears.
 I am just wondering what could be up with her, i know you might not be able to give exact answers i just need to be able to point her into the right directions.
