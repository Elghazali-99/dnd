Hi Ladies,
I just found this forum online and I'm wondering if any of you ladies could voice an opinion.  I am 40 years old and noticing changes in my body.  It's been quite the year. I've never conceived (adopted two sons) until this last year. It was a complete surprise and ended in a dramatic ectopic rupture that nearly took me out. That was in July. I had two normal periods after that and the last four have been totally irregular - either late or super early and there is no red blood. It's all brown and sludgey and there's hardly any of it. I still have my regular period type feelings / back pain etc. I'm just not feeling like myself. I've put on a few pounds and I just feel different. Wondering if this sounds like the start of menopause to you? Too early to tell? I'm feeling like the events in July are far enough away now to not be effecting me still.  Obviously though last May I did conceive - so weird. Bodies are crazy!  I'm sure that's the one things we can all agree on as we guess to figure out the rest! Happy New Year to anyone reading. :)
