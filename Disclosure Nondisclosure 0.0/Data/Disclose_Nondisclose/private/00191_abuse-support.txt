since we get engaged her opinion should be confirm, am an excellent negotiator but when it comes to my wife she always wins!!!
the main problem is when she got mad, she say lot of disappointing issues like my life is disaster because of you, i wish i never marry you, you are so mean,,, etc or i think that when she got nothing to say she tells me that she`s not comfort and when i ask why she says i don't know, i just feel that!!!!
if we were talking on the phone and she get mad of something she hangup!!! which drive me crazy.
if i had an opinion like she was planning travel, i tried to convince her to do so but she wont listen, but when i talked to her sister she convinced her so easy... why she don't listen to me from the first place??
the other day she told me ( i dont know what my life would be if we did not get married or if she got married to a different person or did not married at all?? ) she was OK before that, it happened suddenly, i told her why you  think this way, she say nothing am just thinking, so i told her what do you think? she say i don't know but one thing for sure that my life will be different, i told her i also think so but no matter this life would be am much happier with the life you gave me,, she just closed her mouth and when we talked about that next day she say ( don`t make me feel sorry for sharing you my feelings and what am thinking of) 
one more thing, she create any excuses to avoid making love with me...
 please tell me what to do, am desperate and i don't wanna make any dissensions to fell sorry about
