Well I don't know if this is the right topic to post or if I am depressed
It all started when I moved from another country and well I hate living here, I miss so much my friends, I miss everything, I hate waking up everyday to go to school when I really don't want to, I cry every morning and night its been I think 6 months since I moved and I feel the same or worst, I'm so not used to High School I mean I'm a sophomore but I come from a school where is totally different and I feel so uncomfortable cause I'm not used to speaking english sometimes I screw up what I say and I just feel like the most stupid person in the world I don't have friends and I'm a person that needs to talk like a lot my old teachers used to get mad at me for talking in class but I just had to much things to share, I miss so much my best friend I miss being in this comfort zone, I even think I changed I feel like I don't have strength to confront the world I used to like so many things I used to want to become this famous singer and everything and all that is gone I feel so miserable and I just want to sleep and sleep so I don't have time to think and realize I'm here, I just hate it I wish I could drop school because I've never been interested to go to college but my dad told me if I did that then I would have to work and he will kick me out of my house and what would I do if he did that? I don't know anyone and of course now I fight with my mom everyday and I just hate it I told her that the best it was that I moved to orlando with my friend but she told me that this was my house and if I wanted things work out then I should stay but I don't want to I know if I go there it will give us time to think but well all those plans got screwed cause my friend is moving to a smaller apartment and she doesn't have room for me.
Every time I see girls hanging out and smiling and laughing I just feel so jealous if only I had my bff here everything would be so different I never thought it was going to be so difficult and of course I always think of killing myself, I tried to kill myself today but I just couldn't do it that made me ask myself do I really want to die? but I just don't know the answer
I need help to feel better cause I just hate feeling like this
