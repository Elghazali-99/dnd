I am just looking for any experience or words of wisdom for kind of a 2 part question. I am dealing with a rough time in my life right now & about a month ago was put on Wellbutrin sr 75mg 2x a day. My pcp wanted a med that could help me get through this time and I wanted something that could help me focus and not make me as tired during the day, as I had been exhausted. At first the Wellbutrin seemed to give me that energy boost which after the first 10 days kind of leveled out more. I've now been feeling like it makes me feel more "normal" (normal energy & focus) for a few hours past my dose (8am and 2pm) and the other times are like a complete drop in energy, not even normal tired....just SO exhausted. I have also gained some weight, which being a pretty healthy eater & regular exerciser has been stressful. 
 I have an appt tomorrow and was considering, after talking to a pharmacist in my family, asking to try the XR formula. I've read this is name brand only currently which has shown less weight gain than the generic. In addition, anther family member currently takes the XR formula and her doc added Provigil to help with her exhaustion throughout the day. I've seen a little online about Provigil with AD, as I realize that's not the FDA approved usage but I wanted to see if that was completely out of the ordinary? I want to ask my pcp about it but also do not want to sound completely off about the med, if that's not something that it typically is prescribed for. 
 Any experience, suggestions, or words of advice? 
 Thanks.
