While I was living with family members for 3 weeks the following occured by a 14 1/2 year old nephew whom is out of control and has had very very little discipline ever in his life: repeatly farted around and in my face, he poked me in the breast, walking around the house numerous times with only a towel on while his bottom was exposed including walking into my bedroom while I was getting ready to get in bed, then exposed him penis to my 7 yr old daugher while I was in the room.
NOTE: Grandparents are EXTREMELY attached to the nephew.
The grandparents, who were responsible for him at the time since the parent is not around for 4 days of the week, have had a talk with him (never did any good in the past) and that was it. My husband did discuss this with one grandparent who really did not show a large degree of concern to the exposing.
I stormed out of the house when I realized that they felt the issue was taken care of just by talking to him and that it should be just dropped. I am very angry, hurt and confused that her own grandparents/aunt are not more concerned about this.So now I am the one in the hot seat w/ the family b/c I am making to much fuss about this. I know that he knows better but I am not allowed to discipline him and he has no respect for any of the adults in his life.
I plan on keeping him as far away from my daughter as possible but there is still the family get-togethers and my husband is not ready to lose his whole family over this yet. 
I have tried to look up information about this but have not gotten a lot of info.
Am I wrong to be concerned that a 14 1/2 yr old boy exposed himself to my 7 yr old daughter?
