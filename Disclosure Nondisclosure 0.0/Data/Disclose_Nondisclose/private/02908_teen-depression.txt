i'm sixteen and from as long as i can remember i've never been fully happy. when i was seven or so i hated my weight (which i guess wasn't strange for a girl) and when i was twelve i would cut my arms daily, then i stopped being sad for a few years. but about eight months ago i became really paranoid and upset. i don't think i've gone a day now without thinking how to kill myself. but i don't need a lecture on suicide, when i'm happy i persuade myself against it. 'when i'm happy'- i get really bad mood swings, i'll be really happy one moment then within a few seconds i'm wanting to die. i've been cutting my hip for a while now. i first did it last year, but it was a one off. now i'm doing it often, only being stopped by my boyfriend's reaction and the fact i'm going on holiday next week and i can't hide them from my parents. i've also been making myself sick for about two years now. i don't think i've explained how i've been feeling well. but i can't live like this much longer, i'm 'in love' with my boyfriend. we've been best friends for a while and it's not just silly feelings. but the paranoia is making me so clingy and weird like i'll pretty much cut myself because he took over five minutes to reply to a message. and it's making him like me a lot less. i've spoken to him about how he makes me feel (we had sex for the first time two days ago, and then he's barely spoke to me since) but he just gets mardy and says that me complaining is making him like me less. i know that if he left me i'd kill myself, without a second thought, against better judgement. so i really need to sort it out. does anybody know what this is? it's not depression
