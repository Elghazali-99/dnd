I'm an adult child of an alcoholic among many other things.  But as of late, during one of my father's drunken rampages, he told me (what I've already heard) that everyone despises me.  However he added something new.  He suggested I do everyone a favor and kill myself because I'm selfish for living.  Through all of my years of therapy, hospitals, medication, and other miscellaneous forms of treatment, I've been pressured into believing that suicide is selfish.  
 I don't want to think about whether or not everyone really wants me dead.  I already know my family doesn't like me - they make that very clear.  But I'm stuck in a cloud of right and wrong.  No one has the authority to tell us how to live or die.  We make our own decisions, even if the majority of people may deem it horrible.  Being Bipolar, it is my necessity to ask "is all of this worth it?" every day.  The question of whether it is worth it or not has mutated with "I'm apparently selfish alive or dead".  
 Please don't tell me that my life is worth living or that things will get better, and especially not "your dad is wrong".  There is the reality and then there is your heart.  The reality is that the sky is blue, but if you feel like it's purple - it's purple.  
 There is little possibility in having faith when similar words are constantly being thrown in your face.  How do you expect to escape those haunting words?
