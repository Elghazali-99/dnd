I have been to hospital once and it's been long and this disease is very very much dangerous like a never ending pain. I am having smooth life and little bit psyco too everyday. I don't know do i need to be big psycho or what?  Hospital is very expensive. First time when i been there i got a 50000 dollar bill. I am tried with dangerous disease. My other friends condition is more complex. When i been there first time i didn't have electric shocks cause i didn't faint. Does anybody have experienced electric shocks? I was re diagnosed at home long time before. That means i have go fully insane very very very dangerous. I used to take risperadale. Actually i need to go insane and going insane is very risky and dangerous thing at home, and i cant pay hospital bill though hospital is safe to go mad. I used to think I will be ok if i take good medicine and go small psyco everyday, but this disease is really really dangerous according to my experience. most dangerous. I am worrying now i don't now i am fine or not.
