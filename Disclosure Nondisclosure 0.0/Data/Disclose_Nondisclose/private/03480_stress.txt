Hi,
 As many others I got kicked from the HIV prevention forum and ended up here. I had protected sex with a prostitute 8 months ago, I know it 's a NO risk exposure and all, but 2 months ago I looked at the mirror and throught my tongue was whiter than normally (even though everyone else told me it was ok). I started panicking and devided to give blood to have it tested, once I did that, everything got much worse, during the waiting time that they would tell me if anything was wrong I got a lot of symptoms like diarrhea, sweating during sleep, sore throat and dry mounth.. well meanwhile I couldn't wait any longer went to the doctor (he looked my neckk, throat, tongue and didn't find anything abnormal) I asked for the HIV test, which came back negative. i felt good for couple of days but then started stressing again about the other result.. which also came back negative, it made me feel good for a while.. but I am back on it..
 I still have intermitent diarrhea and stomach pains, i can't stop thinking about it, everything that happens in my body I connect to it. It's a nightmare.. I can't touch my wife out of guilty and the slightlest possibility I may give her something.. 
 Guys.. if anybody has had any experience like that.. please let me know how you got over it. I am desperate!
