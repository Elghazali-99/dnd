Sometimes the circumstances of a break-up and the animosity that men who are at this personal identy stage overide accountability or responsibility for the havoc it wrecks on so many others, they tend to be otherwise entertained.  
 Now i'm waking up to the fact that i think my husband is demented enoungh to try and make me sell this property nd split it.  I've got to admit that i haven't been taking it well and i've said and done things that i'm not proud of, i think at that boiling point you are relieved of the burden and can move forward to the resolution and acceptance of what's happening.
 Today i spent most of the day fine tuning the documents on 'The List'.  i borrowed a digital camera from my brother and going to take pictures and inventory his tools and the shop stuff.  i have the recipts for at least 90% of the stuff in there.  He liked his tools.  It's a way for him to make a living, he has skills, he's only 54, he can find a job in Los Vegas and settle into his life there.  Experience the things he's missed since he married me when he was only 23, just out of the Marine Corps.  It's going to take a pretty big truck to haul that stuff off. i just hope he does it soon because i hate it hanging over my head.\
 Question:  What do i do now to protect myself?
