Hey,
My girlfriend told me that she was recently diagnosed with clinical depression and was put on medication. I have never been in this situation so I am utterly confused about the whole thing. Like some of the other threads I've seen, I'm not sure if I should back off and give space. I want to be supportive and be there for her, but I don't want to be too overbearing. She also has difficulty opening up sometimes and I hate to pry, but I recognize the seriousness of the matter. 
 In all honesty, I just want the best for her. If she needs to be on her own to figure this out then I can accept that. I understand the harshness of break ups if it comes down to that, but I'm the nice guy so ending things is not easy for me and this will not make it any easier.
 Lastly, we had an argument concerning this issue and she stated that part of the cause of the depression was our relationship. Frankly, that hurt like hell and added more confusion. I mean we've had a solid relationship and there's never been any negative attributes besides the usual arguing between couples. 
 Any advice or comments would be more than appreciated.
