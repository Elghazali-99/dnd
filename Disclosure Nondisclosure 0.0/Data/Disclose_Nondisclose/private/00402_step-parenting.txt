(30) engaged to man (42) who divorced (twice) and has 3 children from the marriages.
I had never intended to date/marry someone with children/divorced but life happened and i fell for him. When we met he was already divorced from both.
Children are 9, 14 and 16 (the youngest is from his second/most recent marriage) i get along really well with the youngest and the oldest who is a boy. It is the middle girl who has problems with me. In my presence she holds onto her father continuously and previously sent me mail on face book calling me a witch and used all sorts of vulgarities. i got two emails at once and the next was her telling me the initial mail had come to me in error and was meant for an enemy. False.i didn’t know she had any issues with me till then,, which she denies.i decided to distance myself from her-which i know i shouldnt, however i am civil to her and discussed the issue at length with her father.
The girls mother (ex wife number one) does not even respond to my greetings when we do happen to bump into eachother, she will however exchange greetings with my fiance. AS i do not know the woman i have decided not to bother with her.His last ex wife is pleasant and we say hello and chat.
Will  things ever change with his teenage daughter?
how do i handle-lack of chores, vulgarities between the children and bad language in general? plus the lack of rules in the household? i have raised these issues with my fiance who has told me he spoke to the children etc -in my absence as i am from another state.
I feel overwhelmed, like im not being heard. I feel as though things will never change. i didnt know it would be this hard,, and its not easy sitting back and not being able to lay down the law. I have not been married previously and have no children of my own but grew up with several nephews and nieces.
Please can soemone help me do things right and make the right choices so we can all be happy in the long run.
