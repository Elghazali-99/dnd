I got married on May 30 2012. I have been love with my husband since my college and after so many struggles and against my parents I came out of my home and married him. Am the only daughter of my family and somehow my love was more important to me that time and I came out of my home. We got register married with his parents help. Some how we started a living but now he has changed a lot. He used to be a short tempered person before also and even slapped me in the middle of a road in Chennai but then I was in love with him truely. But after marriage I realise he is not in true love and he argues for what ever I say. Even a single day doesnot end fully without fight. He even beats me and throws things on me. The worst part is I don't have anybody for me to even share this. My parents does not talk with me because I brought a big shame to them because I eloped from home. Daily I spend just crying. When I tell this to his mom she says I ll have to adjust... I am very depressed. I work in a reputed software concern and I cannot concentrate on the job or I am happy anyday. Pls help. I feel very depressed.
