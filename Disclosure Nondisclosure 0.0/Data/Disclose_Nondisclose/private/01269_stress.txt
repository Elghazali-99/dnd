Nice to meet you all. My name is Kathy. Honestly I joined this group to try to find someone with some similar problems as mine. I have been diagnosed with a seizure disorder that affects my ability to speak and reason and leaves me severely disoriented. In minutes I can turn from a normal person to someone who appears mentally retarded. The affects of the so called seizure can last from hours to days and when it wears off I am fine again. It has been happening so frequently it's disrupting my life and my work. Stress, weather changes, fatigue, not eating enough, alcohol and caffeine are some of the triggers. A psychiatric evaluation assured me this is not psychiatric. I have swollen joints and fatigue, weakness, stomache trouble, menstrual disorders and a whole myriad of unexplained symtoms. Tests for Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and Lyme disease all came back negative and I'm at my witt's end searching for answers. I don't want to just settle for a diagnosis for a seizure disorder when I feel so sick. There are times it is in remission and I feel fine even for months. I have a positive lupus anticoagulant but negative ANA and elevated eosiniphils. I just don't know where to get help anymore because I don't know what's causing it. I'd appreciate any ideas anybody may have
