A few weeks ago, I went to a doctor (Internal Medicine) because I was experiencing dizziness especially when I study. He diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed SERC 16mg. After a few days, I went to an another doctor (EENT) who also ruled out that it was vertigo. She prescribed SERC 24mg. The medicine was working well and the pressure in my head was gone. After a week (when the medicine she prescribed ran out), I went to see the latter to have a follow-up check up. I told her that I would feel pressure in my head only when I study. But sometimes, I would feel lightheadedness but it's fine. I could still maintain my balance. She then told that it might be related to my brain so she made a request slip for a CT SCAN. However, I went to another EENT to have a second opinion. He also said that it might be due to stress and consequently affecting the brain. He suggested that I would go to a neurologist. However, I cannot go there yet since my card is not available for any neurologist in our city.
 So my problem is there would be pressure in my head when I start studying and it gets worse when I continue. Is there any illness whose symptom is like that?
