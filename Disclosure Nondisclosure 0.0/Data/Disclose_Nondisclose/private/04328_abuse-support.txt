Iv been with my girlfriend for 2 months now, and recently Iv been noticing things about her that kinda worry me.. she lives with her dad and brothers. One time when I was at her house she was taking a shower, and her dad had to pee, he knocked on the door and said 'are you almost done in there?" and in stead of waiting for a response, he just walked in and started peeing while she was naked in the shower... she dident seem to mind very much but i was quite bothered about her lack of privacy... shortly after that, was when i noticed wierd behavior from her, one night i was on the phone with her and i asked her why she never opens up to me, she said "because she cant, its just the way she is". when i continued to try to get her to open up to me.. she got emotional and started crying. later that week i learned that she had cut her self on the wrist that night i was on the phone with her. Now Im also confused because her dad never lets me over. she claims she does'nt like being at her house, but she never wants to leave.. its pretty confusing to me. she seems so sad all the time, but never says why, because she of course doesnt like to open up to me. Is somthing really going on? or am i just paranoid and crazy? I dont know what to do. is there anyway to tell if shes being abused, or things i should look out for? Questions i should ask? I want to find out why she acts so strange all the time, but i dont want to seem like a weirdo if im wrong. I need really good advice.
