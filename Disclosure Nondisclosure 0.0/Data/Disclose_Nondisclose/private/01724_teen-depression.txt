How can I tell my doctor I think I am depressed??? The only time I go to the doctor is when my mum takes me to get more medication for ADD and I dint feel comfortable asking the doctor infront of my Mum. And if I were to book an appointment with out telling my Mum she might not even me go out the day of the appointment!!! I dont see my doctor for at least another 4 months!!! I really want to tell my doctor because I want to knownof I am depressed! I am pritty much positive that I am but I can't be sure until I ask a doctor!!! What am I supposto do??? I don't want my Mum to know because every other time I have told her about somthing seriouse she just ignores it. Like I told her I had a really bad head ace the night befor and that it felt like my face was asleep amd that my right side of my throat was being sqeezed shut she said oh well it dosent now so. I told her it Burt to breath she just told me to take a tylanol and wait to see in the morning. I tell her I stood up to fast and that I think I fainted because I don't remember falling she was more concerned about the towl pole thingy that I tore out of the wall when I fell!!! So I don't want to tell her plus if I did she would probably just be mad and if my step dad knew he would say there's that poor me syndrome again so I can't go to the doctors with my parents so how am I supposto to tell my doctor??? With out my parents knowing and like I said if I book an appointment on my own that my Mum dosent know about theres a big chance that my Mum won't even let me go out that day!!! So how do intell my doctor???
