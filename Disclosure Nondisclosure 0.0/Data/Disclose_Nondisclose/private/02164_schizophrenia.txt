Hello my name is Frank I got  parnoid schizophrenia since I was 17 years old. I have always been self aware of my disability since that age im now 21. I need help from people that have control of this im in deneial Im going to tell how I feel and why i feel this way. I hear people talk about me but my family and doctor say its a hallusanation but Im like no its real I can hear it but they tell its not. so I think people would only know my personal bussiness because if they had camras in my house and I sometimes think people can read my mind. I dont want to beleive it but i hear them talk about my thoughts. I think music and tv is about me and I hate it I just want to be how I use to be I dont know how to not get mad when I hear people talk about me or these hallusinations. Im very parnoid I dont want to think these things but im very stubborn that im on a tv show and etc. Im on full meds too btw but i still think this.
 What I want to ask is how can I prove to myself that my audio hallusnations are real? should I confront the people I think talk about me and ask them if they are talking about me? I need some sure way for me to know that I am really hearing hallusinations or if any people that have control of this Disability can tell me any other methods to make me understand what i hear isnt real and how to keep from getting agry with the public?
