Hello, I'm recently married and my husband 21 years old has severe mood swings and anger problems. He is aggressive and takes his anger out on his 2 yr old son. He has trouble just dealing with day to day stresses like working two jobs, having a son, and financial problems. He will go out of his way to say things to make me sad or cry. He gets enjoyment out of it. He treats his son as if hes older and expects him to know things he couldn't possibly know then gets mad when things don't go exactly his way and punishes his son for it. He frequently calls me names and tells me to leave. One minute he will be really mad and self loathing then the next he will be chipper and happy with life. I need help on how to deal with him, how to help him, and most of all how to keep his son away from his anger. He can be a really great dad but only when he feels like it. He wasn't like this when I met him but according to his mother he was like this is his last marriage and it started when his son was born. He also never believes me when I tell him I love him and doesn't believe that he satisfies me. He thinks very low of himself and doesn't understand how anyone could ever love him. He also assumes that because things went a certain way with his last marriage that they must go the same with us. She left so I must leave him eventually. She cheated so I must be cheating.. and so on. I love him dearly and want to find help for him. When hes happy or in a good mood hes amazing and I love being around him and spending time with him, but when hes down and angry he is very hard to deal with and I don't want his son taken away from him because although he may act at times like he doesn't care about him I know he would be crushed if that happened and it would make his anger problems worse. Please help!
