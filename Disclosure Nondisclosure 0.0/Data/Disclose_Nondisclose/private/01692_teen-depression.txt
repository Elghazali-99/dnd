I'm in need of a friend.  I am thrirteen years old and I am a girl.  I have some issues but I really need someone to talk to.  I don't have any friends because i'm not comfortable talking with people face-to-face because of my self esteem issues.  I suffer from severe depression and i'm proud to say that this school year I only tried to kill myself six times.  I have had depression since I was ten.  I also have a mild anxiety disorder that i'm working on with a councelor.  So far so good.  Aside from all my mental problems, I have some issues with my family too.  When I was born my mom was nineteen and my dad was sixteen.  Now that they are in their early thirties and late twenties, they aren't the same as they used to be.  My mom is alway angry with me and using harsh tones.  I really miss the way she used to smile at me every morning, open my blind and say "Good morning sunshine!".  Now she just says "great, your up"  sarcastically.  I've actually grown to hate my father.  He is ALWAYS angry with me for something and he is always teasing my which doesn't help my self-esteem.  Thanks to him always giving me charlie horses, wet-willies, nugies, and pressure points, i'm always flinchy when someone comes near me.  Some times I get so fed up with my parents and my life that I just want to sit down and cry, which usually leads to thoughts of suicide.  Can somebody help me cope?
