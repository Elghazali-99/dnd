where do i start. I'm 17, but I was 16 when i happend... i think. When bad things happen sometimes i shut them out, so I'll tell you what I can recall. My boyfriend basically got kicked out and was living with me, everything was fine for a while, and yes we were sexually active. after a while he changed, was distant and stuff, acting kind of insane i guess. I broke up with him for a while but he was still liveing with us. one night we kissed and i pulled away and he stated putting his hand down my pants and i pulled it away and said "no, we shouldn't" and he did it again and i said the same thing but he kept going and for some reason i dont understand i just kind of went limp, i didnt move or say a word, he undressed me and i barely struggled, and he just went on, and all i could say was why, i said it about 7 times. he stoped for a second, just long enough to see the tears running down my face but all i did was turn away sorta stund, just breathing untill everything was over, my whole body felt kinda numb and my mind went kinda blank, almost like i couldnt move. a few days later i didnt even really remember any of it, he told me i over reacted and i was still kind of in shock i guess cuz i just shruged and walked away. I told him one of us should move out to the family room, but he just started getting mad and nothing really changed untill i got so emotional about everything that he left, and then it all started coming back. but maybe im just over reacting, i dont even know what to call it
