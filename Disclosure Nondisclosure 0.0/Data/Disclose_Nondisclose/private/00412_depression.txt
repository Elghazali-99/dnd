Before the holidays began my depression meds stopped working and now I am not doing well. My daughter and I help manage my mother's care giver situation. We hire, train the care givers. I shop for her once a week and do her pill boxes. She has early onset Parkinson disease dementia. We have no help from other family members. The situation is very stressful for the both of us. I have been to see my psychiatrist a few times and told him how severely depressed I am and how I struggle from minute to minute on a daily basis, but all he gives me are anti-psychotic or anti-seizure meds which are not working. I have bipolar depression and they put me on the lowest dose of lithium and I was zombied out and it had a very strange reaction with my thinking so I quit. I tried to see my counselor but it doesn't seem to help. I bought a book on mindfulness and I am trying to incorporate it into my daily life. This is so hard and I am struggling. Anyone else out there in a similar situation?
