My cousins always played games with me, but one day when I was six or seven I remember they wanted to play movie, and the next thing I know I'm ontop of one of them naked. I never had sex with any family..but they were really close. As I grew up they always got me alone, and everytime I always froze and turned into a ragdoll for them. The first guy to finger me was my cousin, and the first ******* was my brother. I could never tell anyone, I even lied to child services for what reason I don't know. Years go by and they slowly stopped. But now..I don't see any guy actually liking me. When someone asks me out I say no because I figure they're going to ask for something I don't want, but I won't reject because I freeze.. I don't forgive them.. Bu I try to forget. I can't trust anyone and I only bltame myself for letting guys take advantage of me. 
Many other guys forces themselves on me, they've insulted my body and me. I hate no one but myself, I can't see myself pretty and I see fat. I tried counseling..never told them everything though. I can't!  And it's frustrating I use to self harm because of my depression..how can I get over this self loathing I have? I can't be with anyone without fighting because I disagree when they give me compliments about anything. 
I need help..I just don't even know what to think about anyone or myself. I can't love someone unless I love myself.. How can I do that when I'm so far down into this negativity.
