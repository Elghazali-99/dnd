Hi. My dad has Stage 4 B Cell Lymphoma. He just started a regimen of Rituxan and Bendamustine. He seemed to have nearly immediate positive results for two weeks post the first round. His major symptoms prior to discovering his cancer were severe abdominal pain; significant weight loss; and anemia. Last weekend, after 2.5 weeks of no pain after eating, it returned. A CT scan yesterday showed the lymphoma 'shrinking' which is great news. But, the CT scan also showed a slight thickening of his bladder wall. It was apparently not evident on prior scans. He went in for a 2nd dose of Rituxan today; his oncologist wants to see if this treatment will reduce his symptoms once again before his 2nd round of chemo. If it does not, he needs to have a contrast-dye test of his 'gut' to check the blood flow to that area. I'm not entirely concerned about the discovery of his bladder, but I am wondering if this could be a secondary flare up of lymphoma that might require a different type of treatment?
