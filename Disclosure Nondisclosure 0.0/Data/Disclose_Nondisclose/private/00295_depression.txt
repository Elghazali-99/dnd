in February 2012 I lost my only son. I don't have a family physician I go to a walk in clinic. My physician their life been saying for several years put me on a 60 milligram dose of Prozac day. Recently in the last few months I have started experiencing severe anxiety and panic attacks. I've gotten to where I cry at the drop of a hat I have bad nightmares and my brain just does not stop. I know that I am grieving over my son. But I also feel like I'm losing control of myself. A friend of mine gave me a couple of one milligram xanax recently.I am concerned about asking my physician for a prescription because I don't want her to think that I am trying to put away the pass I just want to be able to relax a little. I am not used to taking prescription but I do realize that I am in need of some type of help. It almost feels as if the prozac is no longer working because I still get so depressed. can someone please give me some advice on how to handle this situation. Thank you very much in advance
