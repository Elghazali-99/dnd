Now that my marriage of 31 years is coming to an end, I'm finding myself at a loss for friends.  The problem is this:  all the friends we had were couples.  My husband "traveled" (now I know better) all week and I was pretty isolated because my married women friends were home with their husbands.  I basically went to work, worked long days and came home to an empty house, which was ok because I was tired during the week.  My husband came home on the weekend and we did a lot together, went for bike rides, hikes, out to dinner and movie, etc.  I thought we had a good life.  Now, I find that our couple friends don't know what to do with me.  The wives will go out with me for lunch or an occasional movie, but the weekends are pretty dull around here now.  I joined a support group at church, but everyone seems stuck in their misery.  My kids are all gone so I don't meet people through them anymore and I work for a dentist so it's not a good idea to become too friendly with patients.  Do you all find it's the same for you?
