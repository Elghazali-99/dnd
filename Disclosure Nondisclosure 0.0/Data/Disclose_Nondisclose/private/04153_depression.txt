hey guys, I am a 22 year old white male college student weighing about 130 lbs. I have been on zoloft for two weeks and the side effects are still pretty bad, without any benefits (it seems like it has been two years!). (I have tried lexapro, paxil, and celexa, but zoloft was the first AD I have taken and from my first experience seemed to produce the least side effects for me (although this time seems bad). I know it takes awhile for SSRI's to get working and initial side effects are common. I started taking 25mgs for a week and have been on 50mgs for a week. I am still having INSOMNIA (cannot stay asleep at all), HIGHER ANXIETY/PANIC, JAW CLENCHING/TEETH GRINDING, SWEATING, and constant MILD TREMORS. I am also having DEPERSONALIZATION/DEREALIZATION but that could probably be from my depression/anxiety/situation and just worse with not much sleep...  It has been worse since taking 50mgs. I have enough various sleeping pills to kill a horse (melatonin, ambien, trazadone, klonopin (personal fave), and vistiril (sp?) ) but I try to stay away from them for the most part, esp bc it makes waking up/ class the next day so difficult. Should I drop to 25mgs for awhile, tough it out, or bug my psychiatrist once again? I am not a big fan of feeling so medicated to the point it effects my intellectual functioning (which has gotten bad due to my depression/anxiety anyways) Any words of encouragement would be great! I also worry about what I've read regarding SSRI's and brain damage, but know that I need the meds right now so am trying to commit.
