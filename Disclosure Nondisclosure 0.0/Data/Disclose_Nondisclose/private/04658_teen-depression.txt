I'm 15 and I think I am depressed.
 I recently have moved and lost all of my friends whom I have known all my life. I can't make any new friends because the move brought out my shy personality. I probably have social anxiety or something... I've also had no self esteem lately, and I'm paranoid... Even if someone complements  me on something I think that they're lieing to me. And that what ever I did to get the complement was stupid. At shcool I get mostly A's, but I feel like a loser that will never amount to anything..
 I don't know if this is a stress related problem or a real problem, but I have had lots of chest pain and short breath a lot of the time. I should probably go get checked out but I don't want to trouble anyone. And even if it is something and I die, I 
really dont care... 
 Also on top of it  all my parents are alcoholics and fight all the time. There's a good chance they will get divorced...
 None of this was going on before the move....
I dunno what to do, I don't have anyone...
Should I even be depressed? Some people have it alot worse...
