um. i am 17 years old and..i have had very bad experiences with males. i was molested by an older family member from 11 to 14 years old. when i tried to tell my family no one would believe me and i just feel really bad. i know im not making it up but no one else except my close friends believe me. when i was 8 i got raped in my backyard by two boys that lived down the street, they came down to "play" and pinned me in the dirt...as one raped me the other would hold me down and beat on me then they would switch they told me they did this because i was "black and ugly"..also, last year in June i went to a hotel party, when i arrived there were only 3 girls and like 15 dudes. as the night went one i had a few drinks and layed in the bed. one boy tried to get in the bed with me and when i pushed him away he got angry and got on top of me, i was putting up a fight so he had another boy hold me down while he went inside of me and did what he wanted. after he was finish another boy did it, then another, then another until they were all satisfied. i left oout limping and crying. i didnt call the police because i was embarrassed and i knew i wasnt supposed to be there.....i just need some advice on how to cope with all of this
