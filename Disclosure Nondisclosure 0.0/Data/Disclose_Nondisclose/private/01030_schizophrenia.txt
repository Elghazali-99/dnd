My Partner has Schizoaffective Disorder/Bipolar.  He's lately become very ill and to keep this brief I'm not sure how to talk about it.  I have Borderline Personality Disorder, and my feelings/thoughts may be disliked-below I have listed.
- His Psycho-babble is 'doing my head in'  - and I'm not enjoying the fact that I have to keep so composed  - His wild, dare I say crazy plans he's conjuring for our Wedding is frightening me, I mean will he act on his Grand ideas?  I don't know what to say, apart from 'Yes Dear' - I just go along with his chat because it's all illness.
He is in a Mental Health Hospital at present after taking a huge overdose.  I've come to realize that he's been poorly for quite a few months.  I believe that I have slid the 'unease' 'pain' 'confusion'....anger even regarding his mental state as part of my mental state.  Mental Health is sure not like having a broken leg, I now clearly understand my Mothers insulting view of Mental Health.  I Love the Man to bits - How the hell to I cope with his crazy illness? :-(  Beanie0  People have been angry towards me and don't understand my mental behavior especially when I self-harm; but a cut is easier to understand than voice hearing, and psycho-babble!!  Please, please help me.
