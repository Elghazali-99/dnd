I have never been close to my mother-in-law as my husband purposely distances us from her and I am starting to figure out (after knowing her for 21 years) that she may have a real mental health issue. My sister-in-law suffers from depression and PTSD from their upbringing and recently shared some information privately with me. Their mother seems to take out all her anger and be very impulsive and controlling with her daughter, but not with her son (by husband). In fact, she treats him like the golden child and me as well. It is a clear sign of insecurity in her relationship with her son, who ever since he was around 12 spent his holidays with friends, etc. anything to not be at home. Her behavior is actually so annoying we limit contact. The story from my sister-in-law sounds like she is the complete opposite with her. She says she is verbally abusive, erratic and depressed around them. If she does actually have BPD, is it possible for her to control and direct her emotions like this? She is overly pleasant and positive (in an abnormal way) around me and our children, but we only visit for 3 hours tops - as my husband is always keen to get out of there. I guess my biggest question here is can she really change her personality that dramatically and hide the impulsivity and hostility my sister-in-law is reporting when we are around? If this is a brain disorder, wouldn't we see it? Or perhaps is this because she views us as "all good" and therefore behaves accordingly when we are present?
