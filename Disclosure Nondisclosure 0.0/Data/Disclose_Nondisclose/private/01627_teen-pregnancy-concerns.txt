Alright, for the past three and a half months i've been extremely paranoid that I may be pregnant. My partner and I. Haven't done anything since the incident since I'm too afraid to risk, and when we did do something he used protection,didn't finish, but only after did he tell me the condom was too small, thus myself becoming a nervous train wreck without any rational thought. I've had three periods and two negative tests which should be the answer there, but as I foolishly done I went online and have been searching. I've found many cases were women have vaginal bleeding mistaken for a period, even though I'm almost positive it was an actual period I'm still worried. I don't exactly have symtpoms. I was recently diagnosed with IBS so bloating and slight nausea is a usual occurrence now.I've been tracking my periods and I was do on the twenty fourth and it hasn't come yet. My nipples are slightly sore as per usual but they seemed slight darker and that's what's confusing me now. I've been struggling alone with this for the past few months.I'll catch a break and then it'll come back because I've simply read too many things that could potentially happen. I was hoping I could find some reassurance from other people on here, and anything would help.
