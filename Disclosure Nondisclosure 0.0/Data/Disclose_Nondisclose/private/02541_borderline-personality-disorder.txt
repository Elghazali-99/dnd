Could it be a wrong diagnoses!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Hi I was diagnosed with bpd almost 6 years ago, but after reading  up on wehat the illness was, I felt rather releived on getting a diagnoses, as for many years i was under the netal health and they had no idea what was wrong with me, and just advised me to stop drinking and it will all go away, which i did and nothing changed, so to get that news made me feel happy and i felt i had finally got what i needed a answer to the way i was behaving. 6 Years on and I have also been diagnosed with severe depression, GAD, panic attacks, and mild ocd.  But I feel that the way I act sometimes is very much like a bipolar, I have great days and sometimes over the top great days feeling overexciterd, for nothing, then i go through very down days and agressive behaviour for no reason, or for silly reasons, i also love to spend spend spend, my appetite will go from eating what i please, to me controlling and punishing my body and eating nothing, i have just recently been admitted to a mental health unit for the 9th time in 6 years, i am currently awaiting phycotherapy (cant spell it) and am on cipralex for depression and propopanal for anxiety, but my moods dont seem to levbel out, anyone with advice, thanks
