I have been married about 5years to my husband. He has a son, the ex left when the child was 5months old.  I am going through so much problems because of his son. This son hates me.  I do so much for him. Everything I do. Buy things, paying the school fees. Even when we buying junk im the one who keeps buying for the child. But now the pressure is getting to me.  I have been so unhappy. The son fights with me chases me away from the house. Tells me to leave. Has a problem with everything I do. Its like he is trying to be me in the house. When I talk to my husband we always end up fighting or he says im insulting him. I feel like he is making excuses for his son. His son has ADD/ADHD and that to I was the one who managed to get the help for the child, put him in a school that can help him.  But my husband is in denial. He thinks the child is going to go to study and become an accountant or teacher. He is 12 he still cant read. Only now he can manage to read two letter words. He is only in grade 3. I don't expect my husband to choose between us so the best is to leave and give them both a piece of mind.
