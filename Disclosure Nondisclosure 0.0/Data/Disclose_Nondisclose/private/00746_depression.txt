Hey hey. I am a 22 year old white male 130-135lbs. Over the past couple months I have been having severe anxiety/insomnia/depression due to graduating/career choices/professional school/dating/moving etc. all coming up real soon. I am a perfectionist, and starting to second guess my life choices (which I just started seeing a school psychologist for). I have had such GAD/Panic issues before, but it has gotten disruptive so I decided to start up on some meds again. I have tried Zoloft, Celexa, and Paxil but each made me slightly foggy headed in the long-run and gave me severe insomnia while starting out. I would guess that they helped mood wise. My psychiatrist has put me on Lexapro 10mgs once a day. I took 5mgs the first two days and have taken 10mgs yesterday and today. It has had the opposite effect as the other SSRIs. I am constantly sloppy tired like I had just had a few glasses of red wine. Will this likely subside as I adjust to the medication? I am thinking about taking it at night now since I know it won't amp me up like the others did (I don't want my sleep to suffer anymore than it has). If I were to go down to 5mgs would that still be a therapeutic dose? Or should I tough out the 10? I am kind of a light weight ;) , plus the idea of being apathetic, foggy headed, and dull witted doesn't sit well with school.
 Thanks for any input!
