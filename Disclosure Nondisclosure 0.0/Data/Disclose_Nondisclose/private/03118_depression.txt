Hi all,
 I been taking Effexor XR 150mg for the past 12 years, I started taking it for panic disorder/panic attacks which worked amazingly and still does,however, it is not working for my depression. I'm very scare of the withdrawal effects and therefore have not asked my Dr to switch me to another medicine altough he swears he can tamper me off slowly and I won't have them I know I will because most of us have, I'm also afraid of the weight gain from all or most of these medicines, Effexor never gave me that side effect, but Paxil which I took before Effexor destroyed me, I gained 50 pounds  in 5 months! and needles to say weight gain now would make me more depressed as is I'm 50 pounds overweight..
 Has anyone experience that after years of taking Effexor is no longer working and what did you switch too and how did you do it as to not feel the withdrawal? Should I increase the dose or should I request another medicine? I'm sick of feeling depressed :( thank you to all for your feedback.
