Our next door neighbors ( we live in row hones) moved away last September along with their 3 Barking dogs. These neighbors were horrendous, they borrowed money from everyone on the block and never re-payed any of it. She even took cookies from a girl scout ( 8 boxes) and said she would repay them, never did. So they left in Sept. The neighborhood had a celebration!  Woo HOO     No dogs, no asking for $$$$   Wonderful. Then Last Thurday night, we hear people in the house next door. My husband went out to see who it was.............It was them. They had defaulted on the mortgage and the bank took it over and a lady bought the house and the neighbors are now renting that house. We had been in touch and she totally lied to me and said she was moving to apartments because she did not want anyone to know where she was living because she owes so much $$ to everyone. She even tried to steal our electricity last year. Thank Gog a neighbor told us she was going to do that. SO now she is back, We confronted her about the barking dogs............ as they moved in at 3am. Her husband says nothing. He is so whipped. All we hear now is them fighting and dogs barking. She told me to keep my bratty kids off her property. Even tho she lets her dogs pee and poop all over mine. I called the police and they said to keep a record of anything that happens. She is is a nut case and my children used to call her Aunt and her husband Uncle. My children cried when we told them don't go over there at all. I am so pissed and angry. she is a big slob who bullies everyone. And when I speak to my neighbors, they are so glad I said something because everyone is afraid of her. She is a good 350 lbs and could woop my but and would. She is that type. I hate my house now. We were so looking forward to a quiet spring with the windows opened. But no more not with the dogs and all the cigarettes they smoke that blow right in our windows. I can't sleep at all because of my anger
