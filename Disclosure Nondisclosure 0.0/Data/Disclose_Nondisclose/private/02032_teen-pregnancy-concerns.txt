Hi guys, im a little worried for my girlfriend as to whether she is pregnant or not. On the 24/6/13, she and I started making out and she started to give me a handjob while i fingered her but no sperms or *** were in contact. After which i just briefly wiped her hands with a tissue and actually gotten some on my hand which i too, briefly wiped it away. After which we proceed to take a nap for about 50mins or so, i started fingering her again with the same hand. The question i would like to ask is that could she be pregnant from this? we were both in an air conditioned room and when we were napping, our hands were like wiping all over the place, on the bed, on the sheets etc.
 However things to note is that after 12 days from that 5/7/13, she had a tiny bit of brown blood that was relative to a size of a coin or a grown-adult thumb just for one moment. After that it stopped and a week later on the 12/7/13, she had a bit of brownish discharge which she told me. She has an irregular cycle as her previous period was 2 months apart while the one before that was 6 months apart. It runs in her family. Other than that, she doesn't experience any cramping, frequent urination, morning sickness or tender breast.
