Long story short. I'm. 29 years with a 8 year old daughter. I have ways been very close to my father. My daughter and I lived with him for 3 years after my fiance killed himself my father started to help me care for my daughter . Dec 2014 my daughter came to me with questionable things he was doing to her. I left everything I own packed a bag and left to a hotel then woman's shelter.  Tool her to the police station and bease she didn't disclose anything to them they closed the investigation allowing my father to take me to court for custody.  My daughter has told her play therapist but the police do not care. The court appointed shrink as advised the court she think my daughter should remain with me and visits shouldn't even be an option right now . But the courts are now letting him try to get access in the meantime because trial for custody isn't until Feb 2017. It's been almost 2 years since I or my daughter has seen my dad and she says to me "after what papa did to me why can he try to see me again " she cries to me telling me she's scared she will have to see him again. My dad also livs with his brother.  Both men are single have never had girlfriends , they go everywhere together . My daughter says when we were living there my dad would tickle his brothers back shirtless while watching tele toon and get her to help him tickle . There's so much more innapropriateness that went on and I'm so scared for her that they would even consider letting him visit her. My dad even has a cop as a "character witness" it makes me sick to my stomach
 If anyone has any resources they know of or anyone that could help. Or helpful advice . ANYTHING ! Don't hesitate to tell me. 
Thanks you
Scared mom
