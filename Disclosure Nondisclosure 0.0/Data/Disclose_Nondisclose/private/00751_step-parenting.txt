My fiance and I have been together for over 4 years. He's 45 and I'm 29. We have both been married before and have kids from our previous marriages. I have a 9 year old daughter and he has a 20 year old and a 17 year old who live in another state with their mom. It's kind of a complicated situation because, while his kids are much older and living far away I was never in a position to be a step parent, I'm just their dad's gf, but he came into my daughter's life when she was just 5, and she lives full time with me (us) and her bio dad is not in the picture so he DID have to take over the role of dad with her. The problem is that she is not an easy child to get along with. She inherited some behavioral issues from her dad along with ADHD and anxiety distorter. He finds her infuriating, and, after four years has all but given up trying to have any sort of positive relationship with her. The only interactions they ever have is when he is yelling at her. I feel horrible, heart broken, Im a mess. We love each other so much but it is so hard on me to have the 2 people who I love the most in the world constantly fighting and me in the middle. It's depressing to know that I am marrying someone who hates my kid. What do I do about this? What can I expect moving forward? I'm hoping to get some insite from other step parents, because I just cannot relate to how he's feeling. We talk all the time about how important a role he plays in her life, especially bes=cause her bio dad is not around. He says he'll try harder to have more positive interactions with her, but I don't understand what's so hard about it!
