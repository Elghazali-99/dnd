My husband has always been so nice to me. I was sent to rehab for 6 months by my family and my husband waited for me. we live together for about 3 years but never been married. i moved to mexico and thats where i met him. and he is a totally raver. im 23 by the way. i left rehab and went back with him. and to the day we still smoke weed. but the problem is that after living together for 3 years i finally left him. hes beat me up pretty badly. but sometimes it really is my fault. if i dont smoke weed and im in bad mood and he leaves the house for a 2 or 3 hours i get mad. when he comes home i start pushing things around breathing hard, i let him know im mad. i push his button. he tells me to click your mouth, or look at me when im talking to you. and i look away. and sometimes until he slaps my face or my neck. i stop being so annoying. i moved out because we have a 2 year old baby now but i miss my husband terribly because i do believe its my fault for annoying him, doing the things he doesnt like. but does he have the right to hit me? or should i stop being that annoying brat i've always been and maybe he really will change?
