Hi again All,
Well I did hypnosis with my counselor 2 days ago. I just have to say that the whole experience was truly amazing. Because my abuse all happened as a teen and an adult I didn';t really need the hypnosis to help me remember anything but my counselor wanted to try to guide me down the road of forgiveness. It was quite sureal I must say. He had me meet all of my abusers from the past and forgive them face to face in my minds eye. Now for me this symbolic forgiveness came in the form of a crown made of leafy vines. As I placed forgiveness onto each of their heads they one by one slowly faded to nothing. It sounds strange I know but the results have really been significant. The memories are still there sure and probably always will be but it feels much lighter like dont have to carry around the burden of all that hatred anymore. Also it seems that it takes up alot less space in my head. Almost like someone opened a window in there and now the breeze can blow through. I feel so much better I still can't believe it. Anyways I just wanted to share some good news with everyone and thanks to all who have been so supportive of me.
