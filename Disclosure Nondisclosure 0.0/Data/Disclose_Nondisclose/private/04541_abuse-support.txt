Hi,
 I have been abused by 3 men in my life during high school. All of them were significantly older than me. Of the three, this has been the most scarring: when I was a young teenager I was primed into a "relationship" with a *********, and this continued on for 2 years. As a coping mechanism, I developed anorexia and I used to self injure myself often. I am 21 years old now, away from the abuse, I don't cut myself anymore and I have been in therapy for a few months to help my eating as well as to explore the underlying causes of my eating disorder. 
 When I talk about what happened to me, I recount the events as if it were a story, and am very emotionally disconnected from it. My therapist says this is normal at the beginning, and wonders that I may be letting out my emotional pain on the issue in other areas of my life that are easier for me to cope with, and therefore that I'm not directing those feelings at the appropriate situation, that being the abuse.
  I was wondering if anyone else has been experiencing this kind of emotional displacement or numbness towards their experiences, and how they are dealing with it? I don't want to feel absolutely traumatized or like it happened yesterday, but I feel strange not really having any strong emotions about what happened... . 
 Thanks.
