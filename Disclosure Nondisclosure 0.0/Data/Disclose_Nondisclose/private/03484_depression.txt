Hello everybody !
I started to take Seroxat (an SSRI) due to anxiety and insomnia about 3.5 years ago , and later get cognitive problems such as memory loss, poor concentration, blunted in responsiveness , impediment in speech and so on .I'm quite certain that these problems are caused by Seroxat (surely not depression or neurasthenia), so I have been off ALL ADs since 1.5 years ago. However my cognitive functions hasn't seemed to recover over the past 1.5 years.
The symptoms that I'm suffering are exactly the same as those discribed here : 
http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Depression/Anti-depressants-and-memory-concentration/show/536037 The starter of the thread discribed his symptoms in the third post. These symptoms are now torturing me...
 I've searched through the Internet, and find many people of similar problems, and to my despair, the Alzheimer's disease like sequela seems to be permanent !!! No people seem to have successfully recovered. I'm a graduate aged only 23 ! How can I live the rest of my life with such a dumb head ?
 My Questions: 
      #1 How can I get normal ? Do you konw anyone who has successfully recovered?
       #2  Since SSRE (Selective serotonin reuptake enhencer) works in a somewhat inverse way as compared to SSRI, Can SSRE (Selective serotonin reuptake enhancer) help ? Is there anybody who has tried SSRE in order to recover from Post SSRI SEs, especially cognitive impairment ?
       #3 Is there anybody suffered cognitive impairment such as memory/concentration loss from SSRE (ie tianeptine  )?
 Sorry for my poor English, I'm in great agony, I really need help ...
 yours sincerely
