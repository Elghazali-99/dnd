I have been prescribed for alprazolarm .5 my daily for the last 1 and half years .Now I have severe nerve pain (feel like itching) in my leg,arms and ears .The pain get worsen some times and I feel depressed and lethargy.I have discussed this with my Pdoc and he confirmed that alprazolarm doesn't cause dipression or pain and he gave me lithuim (300mg)and mirtazapine(15mg) for daily use .But I still have depression and pain .
So I again had a consultation with my Psychiatrist and he  says that I have depression and depression cause nerve pain.I have been prescribed mirtazapine 15 mg per day and it is not responding so he added lithium 300mg per day but no joy and then he added lamotrigine 50 mg per day .I still have the pain as I had before .I have tried increasing mirtazapine and lithuim dosage but it also doesn't help. Can I try stopping alprazolarm and try another benzo so that I can isolate the issue ?.Or benzos never cause depression and pain?
 Can any one experienced the same ?please share your thoughts
