Today my depression reached to maximum
I do not know how many of you like Valentine's day.
I find it sad. Reminds me that I am alone. 
And the one that I love is with his gf having fun. He even organised a surprise for her and all...
So I wrote this poem..
If you feel like that talk to me.
I really feel alone today....
 "Valentine's curse"
 This is how it goes
Someone laughs and someone cries
The one enjoys and the other suffers
This is how it goes
My Valentine is far
He laughs and has fun
I am his little shiny toy
This is how my life always was
A broken Valentine's day
No one can understand
How it feels to be that alone
To think that all have someone
That all think of someone
but no one thinks of me.
This is how it goes
he will have fun
I will not
He will laugh and smile and be happy
I will be not
The knife he put in my heart, this cursed day goes too deep to handle.
This is how it goes
Love is the game that one wins and one suffers
My sky is dark
I feel it will fall on me.
I cant breathe
I can die on a Valentine's day.
So I can complete my curse.
Forever alone.
