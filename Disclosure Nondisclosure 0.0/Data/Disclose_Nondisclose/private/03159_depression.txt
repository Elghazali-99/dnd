I've been on prozac13 yrs, my therapist retired and isn't prescribing meds anymore just got cut off prozac and xanax can't find a doctor to prescribe my Prozac until I can find a new therapist close by. I'm ADHD(just recently discovered that) I suffer from anxiety and endometriosis. Its been around 5day's or so without prozac. Withdrawals are starting they will get worse everyday. I'm terrified and why won't a primary doctor give me prozac? Until 6 year's ago I only got them from a primary doctor. I attempted suicide 6year's ago from going cold turkey from opioid painkillers, got locked up for72 hour's. I'm so confused and overwhelmed and it's only going to get worse.within2week's I'll be in full blown withdrawals. I've been through it once and it's terrifying and dangerous to say the least.so I have to go through withdrawals from prozac and xanax which I suffer terribly with anxiety. I feel like doctor's are playing russian roulette with my life. Doctors are supposed to make us feel safe. What do I do? I feel confusion and a feeling of being paralyzed.....mentally. Everything is overwhelming to the point of a breakdown I'm so completely.......screwed. Never had any problems getting my Prozac. For god sake I'm not asking for narcotics it's only something that I've been on for13 year's. What is wrong with doctor's? And when did they pass a law that a primary care doctor cannot give out antidepressants? Oh but my mom's primary doctor gave her xanax but wouldn't give her her antidepressants! How does that make any sence? Please any advice or information will be greatly appreciated.
