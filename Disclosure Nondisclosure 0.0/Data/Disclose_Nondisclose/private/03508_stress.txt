If i meditate and workout, eat right, try to be happy i still feel like ****. Im going through the most tressful part of my life right now and i just wanted to know if stres can cuse you to become a different person. i never used to be quiet, or moody, or restless but i do have ocd and add, but i have coped with it forever and i dont knowwhy its doing this now. One moment i will feel perfect and the next  ill get really pissed off and i get so irritated and mad at my parents and they didnt do anything to me. I have a hard time getting my words out frm thought. hjeadaches. i forget really easy whcih pisses me off more... I dont have the motivation to workout. i even eat **** food now and i never EVER looked to food other than a source of fuel for the body. i have not been myself and today i had the chance to talk to the Father about this and i was going to but then i got mood swung and i was quiet al the way through, with intense feelings of irritation and anger. i wanted to be alone.  All in all am not a happy guy anymore. Can big amounts of stress that are pushed to the back of the mind trigger all this?? thanks
