Greetings,
 I've been having very strange symptoms that NOBODY has been able to figure out. Whenever I research, it points to some form of cancer. I did get diagnosed with Hepatitis B during the summer so of course my concern was liver cancer. I found out about this because I kept having a feeling like I was going to pass out or faint. This feeling has not gone away. Since then, I've seen a number of doctors and specialists (MD, Neurologist, Cardiologist, ENT, etc.) who could not find anything wrong with me other than Hepatitis B and suggested I had a vestibular dysfunction of some sort.
 However, sometime in August/September, I had pretty rapid weight loss. I went from 212lbs-192lbs in a matter of a month, and this was without any exercise. My doctor said it was due to stress from worrying about the Hepatitis B too much and running to all these doctors. On top of this, I've been very weak lately, lost a lot of muscle mass in my arms and legs, some loss of appetite, wake up neausous every morning along with stomach ache, which go away once I get moving.. on top of this, I've been having an issue where I can't sit in elevated levels (bar stools, stadiums, work chairs, etc.) as I feel like I'm being pushed from behind and I'm going to fall forward or just pass out and faint -- but I never have.
 Asked my doctor about it and he said I should not worry about cancer, mainly because of my age (36) and I was not having bloody stools, blood in urine, clay colored stools, real pain anywhere, etc. Everyone keeps telling me that since my bloodwork showed no cancer, I should not be worried.
 I also went to a Reiki healer who works specifically with cancer patients, and she told me she was always able to sense the negative energy from cancer patients in all stages and she was not able to detect any in me -- and everything seemed organically fine with me (Yes, I know it sounded crazy to rely on this but I am willing to try anything to help symptoms I keep having)
