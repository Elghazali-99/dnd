Hey, thanks for your advice, it's nice to know there are people out there in the same situation.
I tried to talk to him tonight, to be honest I don't know if I've started the ball rolling in a good way or a bad - he didn't react very well to me attempting to discuss how he makes me feel when he calls me names & tried to get him to see my point of view (in a nice, calm way).
 To be honest he flew off the handle at me two weeks ago yesterday - he had set the video recorder & I changed the channel without knowing - he never left a note & went totally balistic at me for it..... I walk on egg shells as he has very bad arthirtis & is in pain a lot - therefore I try to make sure taps are not too tight... etc.. in case something might set him off (which it will). Therefore I've been in the spare room for two weeks as I told him that I just cannot go through this anymore...... but I don't intend on leaving, I need him to get help for himself and somehow I need to get him to see this....
 I appreciate your imput & I really do want to support him. I have told him to think about things and to let me know when he is ready to talk.
For now I wait.........
