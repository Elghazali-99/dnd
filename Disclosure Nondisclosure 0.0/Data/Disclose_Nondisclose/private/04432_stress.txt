Yeah... kinda fits exacly how im feeling right now! SO much ANGER is crossing through my veins right now! I could acctually strike my teeth into someones body and if i could i would suck their blood of so much anger i feel right now! I have people! Their pessimistic *******! who f-ing have nothing to say good about nothing, and it always have to be their way, and whatever i have to say or think doesnt matter? I have tried to input what i thought about moving out with this girl... .and apparently where i wanna live doesnt matter!??!?!?!? So wtf can i do? I would move by myself, but i cant! So i just came back from a beautiful vacation of 7 months! And back to this no personality country! Why are most people ** so selfish? 
Perhaps ive been reading too much science fiction, but mannnnnn i wanna just claw someone and tear their head off! I am gonna drink tonight, until i can forget this sensation! And I dont care if you think Drinking isnt a good thing! Im sick of what people have to think sometimes! HAHAAHAH omg! I am so tired, i wanna partyyy ../.. i wanna just get away! OH my jesus lord of god, please! you are the only one to help me! I ask you to please help me with a job! With good people around me! and that everything goes well when i start school! That the anger i feel now, goes away, and that i can be satisfied with myself! OH and also people help me find love.. or love find me please! Im lonely! Thank you. Have a good night xooxoxo Love ya!
