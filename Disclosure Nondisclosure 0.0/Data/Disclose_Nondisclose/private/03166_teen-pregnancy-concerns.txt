Let me begin by saying i am young (15 fixing to be 16) obviously, and I'm definitely not trying to get pregnant, but i just need advice, or at least an answer. I can say that i am "sexually active" but i do make sure my boyfriend is protected.. my period usually starts every 21 of the month , but in August i got my period on the 16, i did have intercourse atleast a week and 5 days before my period was due, he was protected but when we finished we realized the condom broke and it was to late, i did research and i guess freaked myself out by researching to much, and i was to scared to take a pregnancy test, i kinda thought i wasn't pregnant so i went on. Now in September i've had had sex 4 times (August 23, September 1, 4, 8 )and without realizing and trusting my boyfriend he wasn't protected.. This time i got my period 2 days ealier from the last one the 14 of September(today) should i worry, that i could be pregnant, or am i just freaking myself out again ? HELP PLEASE .-.
