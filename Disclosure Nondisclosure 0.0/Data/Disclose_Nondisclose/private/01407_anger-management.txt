I am angry right now.  On my way back home/library from therapy went through white paint, but no notice at all.  Got out at the library and saw it.  Went to car wash, they did the best they could, but the tires and inner part all splattered with white paint.  
 Got home, called the dpt and they passed me to county and county checked...no work being done by them, so not accountability.  Meanwhile, my newish car looks like **** and I am angry.  If there had been warning or I did something to deserve this.....
 So...being the deep thinker I am in the midst of processing this I think about how people say they don't hurt others by their actions.  I say...BULL ****!!!  Someone ignorantly spilled paint and me and others who had the misfortune to travel through unwittingly now have vehicles which look like ****!!!  I paid near $30 to have full service to try clean this up.  Now if I go to a dealership...it will run into $100's probably with labor.  
 I am supposed to "laugh" about this????  I don't want to laugh. I want my car looking like it did before I drove through someone else's mess they left .......
