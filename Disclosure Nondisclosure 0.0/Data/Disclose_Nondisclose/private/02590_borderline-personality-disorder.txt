can you please advise? does my partner of 15 years have a personality disorder-shows some traits of anti social pd but not severe and some confussing?  before I met him i know he hat was frequently had issues with law (fighting with ex/ driving whist disqual etc) when I first met him he was caught pinching small items (that we could afford to buy and) from work - he was a security guard and lied his way out of it, but he has pinched stuff from most jobs without repercussion but he has held his jobs well.  I have worked hard with him on financial side of things -he fails to organise most of our bills and when left to do himself got into debts (nt lack of money - rarely opens his mail or makes phone calls? in our early relationship there was some argumengts and fighting which have not happened for last 10 years now (sine we had children) now there is no violence between us however we are unable to share any happy family occasion/moments he has to be coaxed to take son ANYWHERE (this causes arguments that I get blamed for ) every day out/holiday/family meal that we attend together there has been angry silence leading up to event and if i speak of this I get yelled at (which often brings me to tears as I do not want this for myself or children-but do not know how to handle him anymore - cant argue back as i am then blamed for arguing and tears just make him more angry - I try nt to show i am upset to try and keep peace e.g he will shout me for a meal out with friends that he agreed to yet when we arrive he is often a different person-happy as if previous never happened-they'd never know )this happens EVERY TIME also another eg. just had c-sec and baby and in attempt to avoid arguments before hols i loaded car with our luggage to avoid usual arguments but he still started on me bout the way car was packed (even our neighbours have commented on this happening over the years-i cant say anything as im told its me, its my fault)- my mother hates him as she sees what he does to us, my anxiety has increased and over the years, i sometimes thik im going mad cause he will say its all me and i dont think its me, he has never said I love you or apologized to me over all the years-all the arguments-he is never in the wrong, he shows no empathy or remorse for me over any of his actions/words (hurtful or aggresive) and always blames me for his ations, he has poor relations with his sister/mother and friends who all once cared for him (but he fails to keep in touch and they are now fed up of him and can see how he treats us), his mum recently died (they had difficult relationship) causing his symptoms to worsen- he is constantly irritable and causes arguments over simple things, he hasnt always been this bad (now when he loses temper he can be explosive and break household things)-its usually when i ask him to do things (he has never shared any housework) but i do ask him to do odd jobs that i cannot do, he will often say yes to something and be nice in front of others and than go moody when asked to do job, he pretends in front of others that he is best dad/family man yet behind closed doors(behind kids backs) I must force him with arguments to do school run,football match, haircuts, imp dr appts for sick child -(yet no one would ever know) -but the kids pick up on the vibes that daddy aint happy bout taking them he'll snap at me and them causing arguments before leaving but kids dont realise it cause but i know-but outside the house he then becomes superdad?! do  he can also take it out on me if he feels unwell,has work or money problems -often Im not allowed to talk-if hes tired/b4 work/after work/whilst telly on -its always on/ but when i complain again i am told that it is all me.  Ive not left as he is capable of some very loving behaviour (not recently between us but frequently with son) openly telling him he loves him and expressing with lots of cuddles etc-my son (thinks the world of him and accepts that daddy is often tired and grumpy),he is sensative and will cry openly over emotive stuff on telly. he has not fully bonded with second child,after my second child he seemed to suffer depression (and his mum died) and did not want to go out at all and was visably deprressed about having to work when he wanted to be home?!  But at this time I felt emotional and that I needed his support and selfishly could not show empathy for him and i felt anger at him!? could he be depressed?he has no motivation for anything he says often he has noting to look forward to as all money and time revolves around children -agaain i feel anger at his not putting kids first but could this be depression cause i know he would be devistated if i leave with the children. but is reluctant to get help as he thinks nothing is wrong and all problems are caused by my complaining, but he is reasonabley intelligant and we have briefly accessed couple counselling before but now cannot afford the costs! dont know what to think, its quite messy stuff.
