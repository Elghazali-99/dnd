I am a 49yr old female who is on LoLoestin FE BC, for 1 yr. prior to that I was on the OrthoEvra patch. I got on the Ortho Evra patch initially besides BC purposes to regulate my hormones for Migrane headaches. I got off of the ortho Evra patch because of the potential side effects and I felt my cholestrol and weight were increasing and no amount of diet or exercise would help. So I switched last July to the Loloestin fe by the following May I had gained another 7 lbs.and total chol. was up to 243(HDL 83) Very frustrated I looked for alternatives and began HRT at the time my TSH was 2.59 testosterone 10, FSH 4.9, Prog. <0.5, Estr. 21. Looked like I was in menopause, no hot flashes or night sweats though. Have been on HRT since June, feeling better Chol.own to 216, TSH 3.36, Test. 292, FSH 6.5, Prog. 5.1, Estro. 30. Weight is now up to 140 (10lbs since last July!) My questions are am I in menopause? Does it bother any thing to be on HRT and BC at the same time?  Is the combo of the 2 causing the extra weight gain or do things still just need to level out? I have heard I should loose weight with HRT now I am gaining even more! Will the HRT slow down menopause? Thank you for any advice!
