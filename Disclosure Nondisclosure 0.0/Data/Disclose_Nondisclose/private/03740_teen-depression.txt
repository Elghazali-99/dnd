Hi I'm 14 year old girl. For the past year, I have been very depressed. I cry myself to sleep at night. Recently I have built up a hatred for my father. When he talks I just feel like flying off the handle. I think because my dad isn't very understanding of emotions and he is fond of the use of profanity. I don't wanna do any school work. My mom is a nurse and she claims she knows practically everything. So, when I express to her my feelings to her she laughs and says I am exaggerating and this is just a "teen phase". But, I feel like this is more than just that. I have thought about suicide or running away. I am always crying and telling myself I am a disappointment and leave them alone. I remember that one time I feel while doing a turn while rehearsing a dance number. In reply, my brother said to me mockingly, " Did you learn that from your dance teacher?", while him and my mom were laughing at me. My mother defended him and said, "he was just kidding". She always defends him. I think because of things like that I possibly have low self confidence. I am home schooled for this last year of middle school so I have basically no friends to talk to. I am sad and the only thing that really cheers me up is going to my dance classes and religious services. I don't know who to talk to. I took a online depression test and it said I have depression and I should see a doctor. If I told my mom she would laugh and say that the test is a joke. Help me...I don't want to be depressed anymore.
