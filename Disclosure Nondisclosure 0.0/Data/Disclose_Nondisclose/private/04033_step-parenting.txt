I need some brutal honesty. I have a step son who is 4, and I've always been in his life (his dad and I were best friends when he was born, then started to date when he was about 1, we got married when he was almost 3 and now he's almost 5). Anyway, he has seen me in my underwear before, but not naked. He recently saw me in my underwear and a t shirt after waking up and asked me "what's that?" Pointing to my nether regions. I'm not wearing immodest underwear, nothing "sexy" or see through, they look like tight short shorts. But my husband immediately says "go put some shorts on" and made me feel embarrassed about the whole thing. I think questions and curiosity are normal at his age, and clearly I'm a mother-ish figure in his life, so I don't think there's anything wrong with explaining that girls have different parts than boys. It's not like I was going to SHOW him mine or anything. Bottom line, I think his questions came from a place of innocence and curiosity, and the last thing I want to do is teach him that there's anything to be ashamed about when it comes to our bodies. Again, I'm not naked around him, I'm not his mother and I realize that would be inappropriate, and as he gets older I will cover up more. Is there anything wrong with lounging in a t shirt and underwear around my step son? This is the first time he's ever paid any attention to it, by asking that question, and I feel like we totally blew it, as parents, because instead of answering his legitimate questions, his dad just told me to cover up and ignored the question. Is his dad right or am I?
