Ok, whew here I go. Recently, (for the first time in 20 years) I told my boyfriend about an incident with my father from when I was 11. He touched me inappropriately under the elastic band of my underwear against my hip..running his forefinger underneath back and forth for a few minutes. I told my mother (they were divorced) over a week later and she took me to a therapist and my father went too. I don't honestly remember much about the sessions and I've put a lot of this from my mind...deep down. I still have a relationship with my father and no further incidents occured. In talking about this with my boyfriend (like I said up until this point only my mother and father knew about this incident, not even my ex-husband) I mentioned that after they divorced when I was 8 I slept in the same bed with him on my weekends at his house, up until he remarried when I was 11. My boyfriend was seriously appalled at how inappropriate this was, I honestly did not see it as inappropriate at the time, I was just a kid afraid of the dark. I'm still not sure how I feel about it. Is it inappropriate for a father to sleep with his daughter past a certain age. The inappropriate touching happened after I stopped sleeping with him. I told my boyfriend that there was no inappropriate touching while I slept with my father, to which he replied, "none that you are letting yourself remember".  My boyfriend also points out that my father is not my biological parent, but instead adopted me after he and my mother were married. I'm honestly very confused and would really benefit from the opinion and advice of others.
