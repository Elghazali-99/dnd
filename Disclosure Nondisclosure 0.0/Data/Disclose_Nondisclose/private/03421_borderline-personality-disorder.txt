I found this forum and after much research I think my wife has borderline personality disorder. We met and married very quickly after my first wife left me and is with another man. In the beginning of the relationship I could do no wrong but as time went by, she would set me up for failure almost..... Basically, herre are a list of the things that I see fairly regularly and I'm wondering if these are regularly present, do I have a pretty good idea that she indeed has BPD? Of course, it's my diagnosis and not that of a qualified professional. The problem though is getting her to go to counseling, which she absolutely refuses to do....  Tell me if any of this sounds familiar. Someone please give me some feedback!
