I have been suffering depression ever since the seventh grade and I am now in my eleventh grade. So in all that is four years, I ended up going to the hospital for cutting and contemplating suicide. I love to watch myself in the mirror as I see my blood flow down my arm. It is a huge relief to see it because I lose myself in it. But I do not do that anymore, well I am fighting myself not to do it. Whenever I see blood, I get the craving to just cut myself up. Instead I just scratch myself now.
 I suffer from insomnia and paranoia, they go hand in hand. I can't go to sleep because when I close my eyes I get all paranoid. Plus I get horrible nightmares as well. They are images no one should have to go through. The pills I take are supposed to help but whenever I start my period I end up just going back to my 'normal' self.
 I want to know if anybody suffers from the same thing.
 People, please know as well though that depression is not a 'fashion' I would never wish this on my worst enemy. No matter how much I hate her/him I would never wish this on them. It is not a 'fashion' it is not 'cool' to have it. So if you are just faking please do not post here. I want to know and hear from real teens who really have depression.
