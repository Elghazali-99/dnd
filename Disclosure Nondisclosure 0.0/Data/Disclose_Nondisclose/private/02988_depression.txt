Hey I am a 22 year old white male. I was just wondering if depression could make someone lose interest in their studies? I am a 4.00 overachiever student about to head to medical school next fall (I think). I have accrued some physical injuries this semester that I am dealing with and trying to adjust to graduating/moving etc and developed some severe anxiety/depression issues (probably already there but have gotten out of control). I am on Zoloft (almost been a month) but am wondering if it is only making things worse. I am seeing a psychologist and have seen the psychiatrist (will check up soon). However, I suddenly have NO DESIRE to go to medical school and it scares the crap out of me. I know I could do well in school if I could just get my motivation back, but am suddenly unhappy with the idea of a profession that I thought I was once passionate about and worked very hard to get accepted to. I am the least bit excited to graduate and start school but have no idea what I would do with my life/degree otherwise (microbiology - don't want to work in a lab). When people congratulate me it only makes me feel sick. I am even considering trying to take a year off to reconsider (and work my old vet job to see if that makes me feel something again to move forward with vet or human medicine from there), but worry sitting out a year will only make me more depressed. I used to cope with exercise, but now I cannot bc I am injured. This is really bad and I am feeling trapped and stuck. Any advice? Do you think taking a year off to get my head on straight/ take the pressure off me for a little while will help? Is it possible to get that drive back and feel happy/motivated/goal oriented again? I feel like I am having a quarter life crisis and wasted my past 4 years at college now... No idea what to do. I have been stuck for months.
