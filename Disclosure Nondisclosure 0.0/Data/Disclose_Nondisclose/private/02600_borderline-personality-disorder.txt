My boyfriend and I have been trying to work things out for several years. 
we have never lived together, but, although against my faith and what i really want for us, i sleep over his home and he will stay at mine.  I rather we marry so we are not in sin.  
we had a child out of wed lock.  He is now 4. Boyfriend is a great father and a great friend. 
Has awesome qualities and i love him dearly.  
 we have broken up and had other relationships and still come back to each other.  i am convinced he is my life time partner and feel he loves me but not enough to marry me.  he claims to have left many great frinedships because of me, but they were mostly his ex-girlfriends with whom he was intimate with.  
 He has no other children other than our son.  several years ago he asked me to marry him, but i was  not sure of his sincerity, so i said no and asked for more time. Now that i am sure, He is not willing to talk about it.  He is more distant, not as attentive and i feel i have lost him.  i have become so jealous.  if he is on the phone, i feel i need to know with whom. ( he has lied to me about his ex calling him. she recently moved out less than 1yr ago)
he said he had her leave so we could be togehter.  i feel horrible about being so paranoid.  i get so angry with him and ending being moody with my kids when i feel he is talking to her or think he has met someone that gives him the joy i cannot.  i dont want to seek psychologist or psychiatrist unless it is necessary.  i fall to my knees and pray, read articles to keep me positive and mostly work long hours (he says to avoid cleaning my house, tending to laundry and even spending time with him)  
 what can i do?
