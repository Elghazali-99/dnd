Hi,
 Until a few weeks ago, I was in perfect health.  Then, suddenly, I started having issues with my stomach.  It's been nearly a month now and it hasn't gotten better.  I can no longer eat the foods that I love and I'm spending every day worrying.
 I've seen a general practitioner who told me to take supplements.  I've seen some mild improvement, but the issue still remains.  I've asked for a referral to a specialist but they seem to be dragging their feet with it.  No other specialist will see me without a referral.  
 My primary concern is that I may have something chronic, that I will have to live with.  I fear that this may degrade my quality of life and prevent me from participating in social interactions which I would have otherwise enjoyed.  I fear that this may make it difficult for me to go hiking, go to restaurants, or even just have a drink with a friend.  I cannot bear the thought of this looming over my head my entire life.  
 In truth, I'm worrying myself to death.  Sometimes I'll go a few days with minimal symptoms and think that everything is okay, but then I'll have a day that I'm just sick.  And that causes depression.  
 I'm anxious, I'm depressed, and I'm scared.  I'm only 21 and have been in perfect health until now.  And now it feels like something unwanted has just been thrown onto me.  I've gone around enjoying my life and now I have something that I have to live with and worry over.  
 I feel like no one really cares.  I've been suffering from this for nearly a month and my doctors seem to be in no hurry.  My wife doesn't seem to understand that I'm depressed or even why I'm depressed.  She tries to be helpful by saying that she thinks I'll get better.  But I just don't believe that for an instant.  If it were something simple, it would have ran its course by now.  
 Maybe I have no good reason to be depressed or upset.  All I know is that I am suffering from both physical and mental symptoms.  And I don't know how to cope with this.
