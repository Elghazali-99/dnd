Q: How do go about a schedule of tapering off and ending my intake of Prozac? (...and minimizing withdrawal symptoms.)
 I was having low-level anxiety, not depression, about financials and interacting with people who have big egos.  I was given a Prozac, without knowing about the difficulties of withdrawal that I've recently learned about.  There was no discussion of therapy, etc., other than her saying "you should look into that".  The drug did seem to help (for the time being), however I was quite functional and happy before it.
 Fast forward a few months and now I have no insurance (I was laid off and currently job hunting), I have 3 months left of Prozac refills.  I am taking a single 20mg dose per day, but I also have about 15 10mg pills left over from the initial Rx (before the doc upped the dose).  I just wanna get off the stuff and return to my previous non-pill-popping life.
 Sorry if this is a repeat question from elsewhere, but I did not find this question posed/answered in the forum.  If it helps to know, I'm in my 30s, in good health, 175lb, take no other prescriptions, have a girlfriend and several close friends (ie, I'm in no way 'feeling alone'; it was anxiety, not depression that was the reason for the Rx).
 Thanks!
