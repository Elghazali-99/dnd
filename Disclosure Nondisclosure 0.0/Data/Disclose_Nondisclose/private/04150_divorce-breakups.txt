Very, very sorry I didn't listen with the last breakup and went back to my man.  We were starting over and letting things build and we started the business together.  It was going so well and then when he got too close he retreated big time.  Confronted him and we broke up.  He has opened up more to me and I now realize how broken and damaged he is.  He cannot break out of his comfort zone as much as he cares for me.  He thinks that the tiniest things would do for me.  He recognizes that he really doesn't know what a real relationship is and that I deserve to have everything.  He let me get my anger out and we will continue with the business (we have to) and will stay friends.  It is me who I am most angry at.  I knew the signs and I deluded myself that he could provide me with what I needed.  It is going to be a long recovery with us working together.  
 I feel like I am addicted to him and keep facilating between aching to have him back and knowing it is the right thing.  This turmoil plus my first Christmas without my mother and dad are really wrecking havoc on my emotions.  He has been my best friend and I can't go to him for comfort.
