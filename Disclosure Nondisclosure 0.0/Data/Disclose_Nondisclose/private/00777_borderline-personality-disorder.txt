I would love to have some friends I could speak with since I can;t type well and am not on the computer that much. I don't know if it's allowed to ask? But I would really like to meet some ladies with bipolar (no offense guys, my hubby wouldn't be happy) who could use a calming voice or vice versa. I have 1 friend, liteally, and she doesn't think I'm BP she says I don't need "all these meds" and I'm about ready not to call as often. We touch base daily, she's a good person who has NO CLUE about mental health issues. It would be nice to hear a voice on the other end of the line and say "hey has your doc tried this or that?" or How do I deal with my husband who thinks BPD is a stigma and 50% of cases are not really BPD just docs wanting to make money by having you come back.
See what I live with? God he's no help, never has been and when I'm stable I'm going to leave. Just can't do it now with no job and freaking out on a daily basis-kinda hard to get a job. The day will come soon.
