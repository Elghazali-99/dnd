My wife has been diagnosed with breast cancer. The PET CT comments say: 
 Metabolic activity disease is seen in the following region: 
1.Irregular soft tissues mass with tiny specs of calcification on the outer quadrant of left breastThe size of mass is 2.11cmx2.6cmx2.26cm(SUVmax 4.5) 
2. Nodes involving the left axiallia of largest measuring 12.4mm x10.9mm shows mild increased metabolic activity.(SUVmax 1.0) 
The MRI findings conclusions are as follows: 
MR imaging consistent with multi centric malignancy in left breast with primary in 11-12'o clock position(2.6x2.6x2 cm) and metastatic axillary node. 
 The other thing worth mentioning in the MRI report is : 
Ductal clumped enhance ment is seen in 12'o clock position along superior margins of areola.Enlarged level I axillary node is seen which enhances intensely on contrast imaging and shows restricted diffusion, the node measures 1.4x1.1 cm. The left chest wall shows no suspicious mass or enhancement. There are no architectural distortions ,skin thickening or nipple retraction. 
 The  other focal enhancing soft tissues nodules are measuring less than 1 sq c. with the largest measuring 0.7x0.8 cm. 
 The right breast is normal. 
 Can somebody tell me the probable stage of this cancer. The histopathology report is yet to come out and the wait is killing me.
