I have been emotionally abused by my mother for years.  I am her oldest daughter and have two brothers who walk on water in her eyes.  She and my father divorced over 20 years ago and she is still single and impossible to be around.  We thankfully live in different states and only see each other once a year.  I feel like I don't have a mother; just an authoritarian, verbally-abusive very sick individual in my life.  I am 39 years old with two beautiful daughters and a wonderful husband. I swore that I would never walk away from my mother but I can't take much more. When I try and tell her that she is hurting my feelings I become "disrespectful".  She has never apologized for hurting my feelings and this has gone on for years and years...since I was a child and all through the divorce and into my adult life.  She is sick and I am so hurt, so emotionally damaged from years of abuse from her.  How do I handle this?  I do not want to take myself or my kids out of her life but it is unbearable pain.  Why does she feel the need to demoralize me, criticize me, my parenting style, my relationship with my husband?  Even if she is so damaged from her divorce, how can she feel such anger toward me?  I am her daughter.  I cannot even imagine treating my daughters like this.
