For the past week or two I've been experiencing some weird symptoms that have been very scary to me.
I know this may sound silly, but I've even considered the fact that I'm possessed by something paranormal. 
I'll be working or talking to someone and all of a sudden I'll have a weird feeling in my ears and I swear it feels like someone is standing RIGHT next to me. Then, I have an instant panic attack when I realize no one is even there..could this be an ear problem? Or something more? 
It happens a few times a day, and it's even progressed as far as thinking I'm seeing things out of the corner of my eyes 
And I think I even heard whispering at one point. 
I feel like I'm contantly being followed or watched by something. Even though I know no one is there! I sit around in fear of seeing something scary..
I do have a history of severe anxiety and panic. 
I'm nervous to talk to my therapist/ therapy group about this because I don't want anyone to think I'm crazy
Even though I feel like I'm loosing control. 
Can anyone offer any advice?
