My boyfriend has alll of the symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia. I want to be supportive of him and help him in any way I can, but it is getting increasingly difficult as his delusions keep getting worse. He is constantly accusing me of cheating on him, and he has delusions about me doing things that I would never actually do. He constantly says he saw me in a car on the street or heard my voice on someone's phone, but these are all delusions. I know that it is the mental illness and not rational thinking that causes him to have these delusions, but it gets to be so overwhelming when he is calling and texting me non stop accusing me of being a prostitute and telling me that he is out on the street looking for proof that I am. 
He does admit that he has a mental illness and has agreed to talk to a therapist, but my question is how should I respond to the accusations? I know there is no reasoning with delusions, but what should I say to calm him down when he is having these delusions? I am overwhelmed and at a loss for what is the right thing to say or do,but I don't want to give up because I am his only advocate, He doesn't have friends and his family is very dysfunctional and actually cause him more harm than good. Anyone who has experience with schizophrenia I would really appreciate your help or advice. Thank you.
