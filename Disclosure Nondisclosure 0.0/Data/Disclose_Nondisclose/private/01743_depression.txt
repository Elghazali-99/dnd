So if any of you read my last post it was called "severe depression" and I was losing my mind on Celexa. So I'm off that now because it didn't work for me. I do know it works for lots of people so I don't want to scare people into trying it. Anyways.. So I met with my psych and he suggested Wellbutrin , my issue is he  told me this is an "upper" . I haven't been able to sleep or eat for a month regularly , plus I have shake in my arms and hands. 
 My thought process is if I already have trouble with sleeping, eating, shakes and anxiety why would you suggest an upper type of anti depressant. He told me he wanted to try a different "type" of drug. Meaning I've tried Lexapro, Celexza, and Zoloft and they are in the same "class/type" of chemical. 
 What do you guys think? This is my third psych doc because I feel like they don't listen to how I'm feeling physically. So far he has been the most attentive. Meaning he calls me back within hours when I call about symptoms!!! The other ones could have cared less. Should I try another doc? 
 PS . I also have a therapist and she's great ... But she wants me to get on a med that works before we can go into trauma that I have suffered.
