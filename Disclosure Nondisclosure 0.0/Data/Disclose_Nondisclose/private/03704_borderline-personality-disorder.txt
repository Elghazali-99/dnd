Effexor, abilify, clonazepam combinationor on their own: not able to function as well to keep job as with alcohol, because of constant dry vomiting and yawning.  Can't keep job with those behaviors.  Alcohol instead:  has allowed me to keep job up to now, but don't think much longer.  Besides liver being shot, other effects.  I can't look at myself in a mirror and its clear that few students can stand looking at me; more difficult daily to pretend to be able to connect with normal people.
 I having been living in despicable squalor, and despise it, but cannot do what is necessary to de-squalorize it, because I deserve no better than this squalor.
 Just do not know how to live as most people live:  with at least some pleasure instead of constant dread and fear.  Very high traditional IQ (pattern recognition), but that hasn't been a bit of help to just getting a bit of a reason to keep on going.  Harder & harder to justify continuing existence
 Any more currently available suggestions that might help will be SO appreciated;  but I understand the limits of remedial treatments to biological conditions.
