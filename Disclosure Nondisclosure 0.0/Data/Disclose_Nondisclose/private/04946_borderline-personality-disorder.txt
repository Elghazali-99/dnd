For as long as i can remember i've been distant from everything, like i'm not fully here. its like having a metal fence between me and everything. u can feel inbetween the lil metal pieces, but u cant fully grasp anything. its like maybe im trapped in someone else's body. cause this body lives without me. i've been through cutting, i can still do it, but it doesn't matter anymore. i don't find interest in anything. i dont enjoy sex. i'm only 19. up to about 18 i've felt much younger. i'm disappearing. please tell me what's wrong with me! ITS NOT DEPRESSION I KNOW ITS SOMETHING MORE. IT'S TAKEN OVER ME! I don't wanna end up like a lifeless vegitable. i don't wanna completely disappear. Who am i? i honestly don't know who i am anymore or what i like. if i ever knew. This has affected me all around. i went to adult behavioral health at fort campbell, ky. they just threw me in cumberland hall behavioral health in hopkinsville, ky. i was there for almost 2 weeks. i just recently was involuntary seperated for this. they dont listen at all to even try to help. that's y so many other soldiers commit suicide. Behavioral Health was a waste of time. now i'm just miserable, emotional, totally out of it. i just want out of this body, mind, i even think about suicide more lately.
