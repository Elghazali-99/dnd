After a few months of bad headaches and strange body aches, my PCP put me on 10mg Celexa. Within two days I called telling him I was getting weird muscle spasms, twitching and pain sensations in my chest, arms and legs. He assured me this was not from the medicine (even though it's described in the side effects) and urged me to keep giving it a try. I did, for close to four weeks. I still felt awful so then - probably foolishly - stopped taking it cold turkey. In the time since, my anxiety has spiked, particularly in the morning/during the day, I get episodes of spiking blood pressure, feel like I have heart palpitations, still have random leg twitching and arm pain, and have trouble sleeping at night because when 4am rolls around my heart starts pounding! Am I still experiencing withdrawal even though I was on such a small dose for such a short time? My doctor now wants me to try Cymbalta, but I'm terrified to because I'm not sure he really understands what's going on here.
