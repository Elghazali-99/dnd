Hey all! So, I started smoking (cigarettes) about 1.5 years ago, and have smoked marijuana for approximately ~10 years. In terms of cigarettes, I generally smoke about half a pack, to a pack per day, give or take (really just depends on what I'm doing/how I'm feeling that day). I had gotten a cold last December, and my cough never went away. Went to the doctor, and he said it's probably just a lingering cough; to this day, the cough persists. Then, after a night of partying/chain-smoking cigarettes, I woke up the next morning to EXTREME chest pain.
 It went from the middle of my chest, to around my left shoulder blade, and then it ended going down my left arm. It legitimately felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest. This feeling went away after approximately 4 days, and I never had it checked out. Next up, I've lost about 60lbs since last February, and while I was exercising/working out, the exercising only lasted about two months, so I highly doubt I lost 60lbs from two months of exercise. Lastly, while I never really have shortness of breath, I do tend to have a wheezing sound every now and then when breathing.
 I'm basically just wondering if I should bother going to the hospital or not, and if I should be worried at all. I've already decided if I do end up having some type of cancer, I will not be receiving treatment (half the reason I haven't seen a doctor yet, it doesn't necessarily matter). I am, however, quite curious.
 Thanks for any/all help :-). Happy 4th everyone!
