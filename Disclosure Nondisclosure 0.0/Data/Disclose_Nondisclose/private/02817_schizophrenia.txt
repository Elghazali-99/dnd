hi im a 20 year old male from UK and have not felt "normal" since i was around 14 and started smoking cannabis
i went "weird" all of a sudden and stoped after after smoing it for a couyple of years
i was obsessed with having schizophrenia and still am, however i have been told off many doctors and therapists that i suffer from anxiety
as im getting older things are getting worse
for some reason now i say the same phrase out loud (a swear word) and can not controll saying it, i feel like i have too say it and can feel it boiling up inside me if i dont
i walk funny and always have an urge to tap my foot against my other when im walking.
i alwsys touch my chest and my elbow for no apparant reason ??
i always feel like im not in my body and feel like i have no feeling, but i cant tell if its just a stupid thought that occours in my head or it actualy does happen, but whateva it is its scary and annoying.
for around the past 6 months/ 1 year i am always moody and always shouting at everyone, i am just so irritable and mad.  i recently think i have a brain tumour as the symptoms of them i have such as... personality changes, feeling numb and weird sensations,Swearing and behaving in a way i never used too, being aggressive, alwasys feel out of it and just really "strange" ( i dont no if this is a symptom but it does happen all the time)
i have seen doctors and speicialists and i just dont no whagt is wrong
someone please help
many thanks !
