Hello,
For the last 3.5 years, my life has been one s*** storm after another. It started when my mom passed away at the age of 52. My sister and I  had to handle most of the funeral arrangements, because our Dad was not able to do it mentally or physically. Then, my husband's ex wife turned us into human services 4 times. We went through all 4 times unfounded (but stressed even when you don't do something wrong to warrant it, you still feel some stress). Thankfully, that has stopped!!
Then, my Dad passed away on my birthday 4 months ago. It was torment watching him die and not be able to help him :(
Then, my husband's best friend died, and now his grandma. Between the 2 of us, we have 5 children who keep us very busy. Our oldest got in trouble at school... I just keep thinking does it ever end? I know life has its ups and downs, but I am wondering if we have had more than our fair share the last few years anyhow. 
I went to counseling after Mom died and am using those coping tools, but it just seems like there is little break in between stress (I call them **** storms).. My husband and I are exhausted. I know we should go to counseling, but counseling doesn't stop the crap from happening. 
We can't take any vacations or time off, because of time used for funerals, etc. 
Not sure what the question is here, but I just needed to vent!
