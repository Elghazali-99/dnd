I'm a 47 year old male and she's 40. I love her and want to be with her. We broke up about 3 months ago and had no contact during that period other then one series if texts after about a month and I did ask her to come back home. . She said no so I've tried to move on. . And yes that does include dating someone else and we have had sex. She has also dated someone and says they didn't have sex because she says he wasn't able due to health reason. . She volunteered that info. .I didn't ask her. She is yet unaware of what I done because she hasn't ask me as we kinda dropped the subject after a long talk.. but I will be honest with her if she asks and I'm sure she will.  I don't think she's telling the truth because they pretty much lived together for about a month. . I would rather had the truth then be lied to about it if she is lying. I brought her leaving to start with on myself so I understand why things happened like they have. Anyway she contacts after the months apart and wants to try again. . Says she still loves me and can't seem to move on.. and I do still love her..I think about her most all the time and ştay depressed without her. If we did try again it would be out 3rd time. . Would we have any chance at all?  I have made some changes and have learned a lot. . But can I trust that she has?  Would we ever be able to trust each other with knowing all this stuff in the back of our minds? My heart says try again but part of me says don't do it becasue I will end up hurt again.. but then I hate to walk away from a woman that after 3 months still had such a strong hold on my heart.
