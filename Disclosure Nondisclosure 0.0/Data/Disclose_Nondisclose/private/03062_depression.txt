hi, just wondering in session today something happened and I need advice. my therapist who I have seen on and off for a couple years, answered his cell phone in the middle of our session. I guess apparently some pipes burst in his house and his wife was calling him, so he is taking the phone call right there so I say should we do this another time? and he says ill be right back and leave the room to take his call. Well I got really upset so I just walked out and went home. He called me about ten minutes later and left a message he apologized for the short session and wanted to reschedule.  But to give some background I self harm have had problems with suicide ideation and the past week my anxiety about choking has got so bad I stopped eating solid foods. this whole experience has wrecked me I keep thinking wow you cant even pay someone to give a **** about you. I don't even know what im doing maybe I just cant get any better, anyways is this reasonable for someone to do this to me or is he just a lousy therapist?
