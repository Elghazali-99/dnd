HI, I have a close friend who is at the end of her tether due to her 21 yr old daughter being diagnosed with BPD. It is destroying her family and two younger sisters and even her father of whom she has filed for accusations of Rape, who is still on bail even thought she has tried to retract her statement and several others have also been accused of raping her. She has tried to commit suicide on several occasions now and is at ther moment  staying in an all girls psyhc home, of which she can still come and go. My friends problem is that she seems to be getting no true help and no one is listening to her. She feels as though her BPD has been brought on by the medication, Citolopram, sleeping tablets and sometime has Arazopan. Her mum, my friend, does not know where this will all end and does not know what to do. I work with her and see how she is being destroyed by the stress. Can anyone advise her on the meds she is put on and how her mum can deal with the future. PLEASE!!
