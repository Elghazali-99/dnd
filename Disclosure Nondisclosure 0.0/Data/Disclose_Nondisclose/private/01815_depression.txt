Called dr. to ask how to do this today. Whenever I've missed a dose, by the afternoon I feel nauseus, generally yucky, and start getting those "brain shivers". I take 50 mg per day which is the lowest dose, and it's extended release. Doctor advised to cut down to 1 pill every other day for a week, then every 3 days for a week then stop. I'm skeptical as I've read bc of the short half life of Pristiq, this basically causes you start the withdrawal process from day 1 again on the days you are skipping a dose so it's a waste of time. I've also read that cutting an extended release pill in half isn't really as bad as people make it sound and that this approach is more effective. 
 There is no way for me to take off sick at work if I get really bad withdrawal so I want to get as much info as I can before attempting this. I'm a CPA working > 80 hrs a week until Apr 15 so I can tolerate feeling a little bad, but nothing toooo intense. Does benadryl really help w/ the brain shivers? Can't remember where I read that.. 
 I've been taking this for about a year if that's relevant. Other medications are zyrtec, loestrin (birth control), and levothyroxine (thyroid hormone replacement). The reason I need to stop is because I am experiencing the symptoms listed on the black box warning (suididal thoughts, sudden mood swings of aggression, hostility, etc). I tried increasing the dose for a while, but things didn't improve. When I took another look at the side effects of Pristiq, it dawned on me this could be the cause.
