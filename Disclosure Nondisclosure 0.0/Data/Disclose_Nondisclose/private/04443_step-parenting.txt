My husband and I have been together for going on 3 years now living together and have a wonderful relationship. We dated on and off for an additional 3years prior in which time he had a child with his ex. He was not seeing his son at the time we got together and for our whole relationship up until about two months ago when we had our own son. His son is now four years old and stays with us every weekend. I can't help but feel overwhelmed by having a four year old all of a suden when neither of us have experience with a child that age. I also find it very hard to show any affection for his son and it bothers me that my 2 month old is put on the back burner every time his other son is around. My husband buys him new toys and things every weekend even though we are very tight on money right now. I think he feels he has to make up for time lost, yet if I tell him we need other things he tells me we can't afford it. His 4yo is completely dependant (wont put his own shirt on and every other word is daddy this daddy that?). If I ask my husband to change the baby or take him for a moment the 4yo gets extremely jealous.  I feel horrible but I can't help being resentful towards his other son. I know it sounds bad and sometimes I feel bad but my priority is my baby and I feel like the 4yo doesn't like me anyway. He completely ignores me when I talk to him and if my husband takes him somewhere without me and my baby he starts saying how just him and his daddy can go. It has already caused an argument with my husband and usually we don't argue. I'm scared this could cause real problems.
