have extreme deppresion and anxiety. I am 16 and no matter what I seem to do, I always am stuffing things up. I cut my wrists and my thighs alot and now they are getting to hard to try and hide. I have to see a therapist and take medication. I have tried to commit more than once but never seemed to fully go through with it. I seem to be, not strong enough to stay but not strong enough to go. What can I do because my therapist isnt helping and the torment keeps going. I only moved schools at the start of this year to get away form it all, yet it still seems to go on. I am on the edge of doing something really stupid and that I cant take back but I dont want to. My mind takes over my whole body without even realiseing it. I am mentally unstable and cant seem to cope with anything I do. I sit there at night and I make myself throw up because I hate myself. I sit there and hurt myself because I hate who I am. I want everything to just go away and change for the better but I dont think my mind will let me. It is like it just takes over and without even realising that I am doing things until after the are done. Someone please help me :'(
