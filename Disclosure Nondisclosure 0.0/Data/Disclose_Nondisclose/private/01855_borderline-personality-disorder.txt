hi people out there! i have never sought help online before, but i don't now what else to do anymore. i don't know what's wrong with me. during the last year suddenly the word bipolar got thrown at me a lot... i think it's possible, but who am i to tell? Three years ago i had my third go at therapy. she gave me zoloft which made me better, and then even better until you could say i was too well. long story short i stopped therapy in what in retrospective i would call a manic episode. she didn't even bother to suggest it might be that, insteat she took my behaviour personal and got insulting. that was me done with psychiatrist for a while. then i ket on ******* up everythign i touched for three years. last summer i went to see a new doctor in my homecountry. he said yes, i might be bipolar, but since i live abroad he couldn't give me proper med. however, he did give me a pack of seroquel to sleep since i seem to be immune to valium. i rationed the one pack of seroquel for months only taking it when i was very close to doing something stupid. but i got worse, a lot worse. since i've stopped tking seroquel i'm a bit better. still depressed, but not really suicidal anymore. i'm now very angry at that "psychiatrist" who gave me these pills without checking up on me and even neglecting to mention this particular possible sideeffect.
 So basically: what can i do? are there any psychiatrists out there that arent complete nutjobs themselves? How can i ever trust one them again? i'm really tired of living like this. i am a good person, but i can't trust myself. i sought help many times and nobody wants to help me. i have dreams and ambitions and great potential, but here i am aged 26 and still needing money from my parents. i'm so embarrassed and i just what to start living MY live instead of that of my inner demons. i want to be ME
