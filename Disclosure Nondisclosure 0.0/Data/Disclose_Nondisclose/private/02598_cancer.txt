Hello, 
 I have a question about Fentanyl. I have to mention that I'm from Germany 
but I signed up here because there's not much to find about Fentanyl
on German websites, so excuse me if I make any grammar mistakes. 
 About a year ago I had surgery and chemo to get my tumor removed. Ever since 
I've been on morphine until it suddenly stopped working. My doctors then decided
to put me on Fentanyl. That was 7 days ago. It caused constipation, sweating,
and I was just sooo tired all the time so I decided to try a day without a patch. 
The first day was okay so I decided that I should just stop taking it, since
it didn't completely kill the pain but gave me these uncomfortable side effects instead. 
In the night after day 2 I went to bed, turned my lights off and closed my eyes.
After about 15 minutes I felt this annoying feeling in my legs and arms that FORCED me
to move them, so I had no choice but to get out of bed and walk around the house for 
almost an hour. When I went back to bed I thought it'd be over and was looking forward to
a relaxing sleep. But it started again and sleep was not an option. 
 My question is: 
 Is that normal? Because I've only had 50 uG patches (I'm only 21, they said
it's better to give me a lower dose) and only for one week. 
I can't imagine that these are already withdrawals, are they? I don't really
want to continue with these patches because if these things happen after 
one week, I don't want to know how horrible it would be to get off Fentanyl
after taking it for multiple months or even a year... 
 Greetings from Germany,
Toby
