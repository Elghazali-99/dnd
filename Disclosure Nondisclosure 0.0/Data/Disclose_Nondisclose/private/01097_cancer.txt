I have completed 6 mo. of Chemo infusion therapy for colon cancer. I had an operation in the middle of the therapy to remove the colon cancer. From the beginning of the therapy I had 3 finger tips go numb. As the therapy progressed the numbness spread to all the finger tips in my hands. I had a month break in the therapy before the operation. Five weeks after the operation and before resuming therapy I woke up to the outside of my right foot  and the 2 small toes went numb. During the last 3mo. of therapy the numbness in my feet slowly spread. Now both my feet have numbness in all my toes and balls of my feet. I have been taking 900mg/day (300mg 3 times/day) of Gabapentin since Dec. 5 for the numbness with no improvement. During infusion I was hooked up to a 2hr. infusion of some chemicals before I was hooked up to the portable chemo bag. I was on the bag for 2 days every 2 weeks. The doctor was concerned about the numbness and discontinued the 2hr. infusion. I wondering if this numbness improves with time or will it be with me forever.
