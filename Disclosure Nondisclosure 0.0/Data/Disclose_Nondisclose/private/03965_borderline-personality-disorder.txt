My son is in high school, about a year ago he started dating a girl and it got serious very quick. I know that they were sexually active. I encouraged him to take it easy and that he was too young to have a long term relationship. He cut the relationship of and has only talked to the girl a few times. After that he has lost all interest in a social life. He stays home all of the time, and plays Xbox he has however gone back to martial arts classes 4 days a week.  He quit baseball after 10 years of playing, and has lost all hope of baseball in collage. He doesn't seem depressed, and will not talk about his change of life style. My son is 5' 7" about 160 and looks like a small Arnold Schwarzenegger. He doesn't hang out with friends or talk on the phone to friends. He called me a few weeks ago and told me his truck would not start. I asked where he was, he was at a local park, he had ditched his first hour and went to a park " to run". I have heard that sometimes gay men hang out at parks in the middle of a work day hoping to pick up like minded men. Doctor I'm concerned he maybe having questions about his sexuality. Can you give me some guidance?
