When I was a teenager, my mother chased me through the house with a butcher knife trying to stab me. I evaded her by locking myself in the bathroom. She slid the knife underneath the door hoping to cut my feet. Although I was unharmed, I slept on the bathroom floor that night. I was too afraid to come out so I didn't call police. The next morning I told the guidance counselor at my school. The counselor reported it to the Department of Human Resources. Nothing was done. I just had to live with it.
 That was when I was 15. I am now 26. This is the strongest memory of abuse I have. The memory of it is like a video clip in my brain that plays at random times. Sometimes I count or beg God to make it go away until the memory is over. 
 I had a lot of hope when I was teen. I thought everything would be better once I became an adult and started living on my own. I have my own life and my mother has no way to contact me. However, the memory is still there. At times, all I crave is revenge. I am resentful of other people because most people did not have to go through what I did. I have become misanthropic and distrustful. When I lost the last of my friends, I actively avoided making new ones. I used the internet to inquire about what legal options I might have but I found out from multiple sources that it was too late, the statute of limitations was over, and the best recourse was to go to counseling (which I can't afford).
 How do I help these feelings of bitterness and revenge?
