im 16 weeks pregnant and im OVER the moon about this baby but im so depressed, i seem to cry coz i just wana hurt my bf soo bad and my dad! 
 my bf (turned husband only recently) has noticed ive been very very reluctant to touch him when he wants to get intitmate.. but i suppose that has to do with the fact that ive caught him sneaking behind my back and talking to other girls online, all sexual behaviour of course, but tells me it means nothing and loves me, even though its been happening for 2 years, thats how long we've been dating too
 my dad constantly cheated/s on my mum til this day and tells my mum the same thing my bf tells me, and i hate myself for falling for it.. but he tells me hes "different" .. i dont wana make life difficult for my bubba.. but i cant develop that trust that i have for my bf. but the thing is i dont care about him like i used to, i do love him but i know in time he'll do it again.. maybe its my insecurities but i see my dad in him sooo much and i DONT wana end up like my mother just waiting til the day that he tells me that he has cheated again and again and again.. 
 i hate myself for that soo much i cry coz i feel sooo embarassed with how hes treated me and how thoroughly BLIND i was/am.. i just really hope that someone can please help me overcome this and leave the past as the past.. im soo stubborn and i would hold a grudge til after death thats how much i could never forget the "small things"  i have soooo much anger but i hold it inside..
  someone please help me to figure out what to do..!! i dont wana my life to be bad, or even the baby realising theres tension between mum and dad!!
