I am hoping someone will have dealt with a similar situation...
 My husband's 19 year old son from a previous marriage barely speaks to my husband. It is a LONG story but he blames me for his father leaving his mother. Nothing I would say to him is going to change that and his viewpoint is completely valid from his point of view (and I would never share with him what I know about his mother: his father should have filed for divorce the first time he left her back when "M" was a baby. There is a reason his father has custody of "M"'s sister (now 10, she was almost 7 when they split up). 
 When "M" found out my husband and I got married, he told his father that he was dead to him and didn't talk to him for many months. They saw each other in person in January and things went okay but nothing since then. The son lives in another state. When my husband calls him he gets voicemail and leaves a message but his son never returns the call. If we text his phone and ask him to call to talk to his sister, he will but usualy he says "Hi I've got to go" if my husband gets on the phone.
 Anyway, we are now expecting a child and my husband is afraid to tell his son. Everyone else in the family knows, but those I have talked to I have asked not the tell "M" because I feel that if he finds out from someone other than his father he will be even more upset than he will be anyway. I want my husband to talk to him soon...and suggested that he emphasize that "M" will have another little brother or sister....rather than saying Chis and I are expecting a baby.
 Any suggestions from anyone?
