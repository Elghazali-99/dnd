I am a 28 year old, 7 month  postpartum, breastfeeding mom. My 7 month old daughter is approx. 21lbs (she's a chunker). I have to carry her up and down the stairs numerous times throughout the day for naps and bedtime, and do pick her up off the floor and carry her during the day. She has also been a very fussy high needs baby, dealing with colic early on and just continuing the fussiness through teething and such. I have been very stressed and anxious dealing with her.
 Well about 3 or 4 months ago I began dealing with lower back pain and hip pain which I originally attributed to the return of AF after giving birth. My period did eventually start 2 weeksish later. While I got. Little relief the pain did come back, accompanied by neck pain, joint pain and other muscle soreness. I also began to experience some traveling sharp shooting pains that I would feel in my arm, my feet and even groin area. Lastly... I have had one or two episodes of tingling in my elbow and down to my hands. All these things have given me great anxiety that maybe there is something more wrong. I feel like part of it may be stress due to dealing with an extra fussy baby (along with a 3 year old), and part of it having such a big baby to carry around. But part of me can't shake the fact that maybe there is something more serious wrong. Anyone have those symptoms due to extra stress??
