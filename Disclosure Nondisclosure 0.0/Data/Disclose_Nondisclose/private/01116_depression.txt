Hi. I had breast cancer. Went through 1 1/2 years of hell & have experienced major depression. This seemed to correspond to the menopause I was put into w chemo (at 38). At the time my onc put me on Remeron which worked well but I gained 20# (I was 112#). She referred me to a psych doc since I didn't like weight gain & needed his expertise.. I am now on tamoxifen which limits the antideppressants I can take. I've tried lots!!! Effexore, lexapro, celexa, viibryd, &fetzima  made me almost dysphoric serious depression w suicidal thoughts (which I NEVER had before). So we tried nortriptyline & I couldn't tolerate the anticholinergic symptoms. So I'm back on Remeron & basically starving myself so I don't gain weight & it is MISERABLE. I should mention as soon as I was off remeron in past I dropped back to 11# even on tamoxifen so the tamoxifen isn't the culprit. In my teens I was on serzone & my doc now is considering it since I've tried ALL others that don't inhibit cypd26 enzyme. In my teens it worked well (took for about a year & then moved on. Not having depression til now). Loooong story short: how bad is serzone? Almost every drug I'm on is black boxed for one thing or another. But are these risks of liver problems not worth it? Not to mention...the remeron isn't working like it was did. I'm still a bit depressed but not crying constantly, etc as before. Thanks for any info!
