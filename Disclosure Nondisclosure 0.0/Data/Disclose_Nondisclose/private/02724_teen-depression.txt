I feel like I'm on the brink of actually cracking. I'm a 17 year old girl with a lot of stress from graduating high school, friends, boy issues, the same old stuff. But then I have the deep stuff that I've been locking up inside me. 
I've started crying every night for no reason. Anything can trigger my crying, last night it was cause my best friend put on her MSN when her and her boyfriend first started going out. They just get progressively worse and can go on somewhere from minutes to hours. 
I've also been getting panic attacks that start from something so small and they just grow. Some days they get so bad I stay home from school and get them through out the whole day. I worry about everything, even the stuff I shouldn't be worrying about. 
Last year I've also started starving myself, thinking it could help with my self esteem issues. Boost up my confedence. I was 142 around this time last year (I'm 5"7' and a half), now I'm 115. I still have the need to lose more and the pressure from my family and friends to gain the weight but I hated myself for being as fat as I was before and now I still have the same feeling but I'm getting told two different things, from my mind and from people. 
I've also been feeling like I should just end it. That life could not get worse than it already is at this point. I feel this black hole I'm living in is just getting darker. Even though people say it will get better, the light at the end of the tunnel is just not coming to me. 
Why do I feel this black hole surrounding me constantly and I can't get out. I want to find the light at the end of the tunnel and I want to be a happier person. I just don't know how to get there.
