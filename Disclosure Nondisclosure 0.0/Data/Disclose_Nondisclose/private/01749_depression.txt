My name is Jules. I am 29 years old and I have a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, panic disorder, post traumatic stress disorder and agoraphobia. I was a happy, healthy, loving and productive single mom. I worked hard, and I cared for my daughter perfectly. For 2 years. Then one day I woke up and felt like I was just going to die. I have been through several MAJOR traumas in my life. It was like I hadn't fully dealt with all the pain, and that day, it all spilled over and drowned me. I called in to work and quit my job. I laid in bed all day and wept. And the next day I didn't get out of bed again. Then the next. It has been two years now. I have gotten up maybe 30 days out of the past two years.....and that may be an over count. I have gained 50 lbs, I am hardly a mother at all. No matter the plans I make in my head for the next day, I just cannot bring myself to get up. I feel guilty about not caring for my baby girl, and it makes me even more depressed, and then just adds to the pain causing me to stay in bed. I see a psychiatrist once a month and a therapist comes to my house once a week.I take 19 pills a day. And yet, I am still not able to get past this. There is just too much hurt inside me. I want to be that mom that I used to be. More than anything in this world. My daughter is so amazing and I am missing such a vital time in her life. I read other people's posts about being in bed for 2 or 3 days and how horrible it is....and I just think....if they only knew what it was like. I have no friends, and family has all given up on me. I just get so lonely, I wish I had someone to talk to. Anyone.
