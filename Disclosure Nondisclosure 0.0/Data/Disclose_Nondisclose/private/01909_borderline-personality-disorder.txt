I was diagnosed with BPD after spending 3 months in hospital over 5 years ago and put on medication and completed a year of DBT Therapy. A Two years. later a Consultant told me I no long fit the critiria for BPD and scrapped it from my record. I was also diagnosed with recurrent depressive Disorder at the same time as the BPD.
 I came off a lot of my medication and lead a normal life apart from alot of really high weeks when I would feel like superwomen and nothing can touch me and i would be over the top with happyness and talking alot, but it would always end in bad irriation, aggression and paranoia. I do not get depressed alot but when i do it hits me really hard and last for  few weeks, but the high feeling soon returns.
 I have had a bad year this year with the death of my nan and dad, and also my auntie has been diagnosed with Terminal Cancer. I think this has set of a full blown mania episode with phsycotic episode, excessive shopping, suicidal thoughts, and a high sex drive.
 Do you think i have Bipolar, and not BPD ???
