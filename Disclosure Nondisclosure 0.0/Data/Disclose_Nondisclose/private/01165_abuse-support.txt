I am male, 34, from India, married for last 10 years(wife 2 year younger to me). I have a 7 year old son. I am fighting the  loosing battle alone & I need help.
 6 years into the marriage I came to know that my wife had incestal relations with her brother. My father in-law is a alcoholic  & mother in law is a emotional blackmailer. I broke ties with my in-laws family but promised to fight this battle for our kid  who was 3 years old than. I want to give my kid best in life, which I missed as  my father died when I was 11 years old.
 I even shrugged aside possibility of kid not being mine biologically. We (me & wife)had many session with psychiatrist. Time  is best healer & I was getting over the agony & pain. However my son keeps bed wetting (at night), I recently have kept notes  of the dates. One data is he bed wets when my mother(her granny) is not around house in day time, i.e., when my son is alone with my wife. Is the cycle of abuse hurting my kid too ?
 I am in this marriage only for my love for my son. I am already suffering, having difficultly maintain relations, trusting  people. I am already fallen behind in work. Its taking a toll on me both physically & mentally. I am being paranoid ? If I get out of this marriage, she may take the child to that abusive family(her parents) as they are financially more strong. That would be hell for my kid ! 
 Its all jumbled up, please help.
