My fiance and I have been together for almost 5 years and love each other very much. He has two teenage daughters. If I had known what his ex was like when I met him I don't know if we would have gotten together or not.She has depression and is bi polar.She is making our lives and her kids miserable.So much so that the 14 year old is becoming suicidal.She took off on the kids for a week and a half and is now back.We have taken the girls in of course and it is hard... Unfortunatley their Dad has felt so guilty because of their Mom and how she is.He has been apart of his daughters lives in a big way and will always be there for them.Both girls have issues as well and now my house is a war zone.They have also been spoiked rotten and expect everything handed to them because that is how they have been raised. I on the other hand am a Mom myself and raised three children with rules, boundaries, guidelines.Worked for all three and they grew up to be amazing individuals..... My house s in chaos and I am feeling like an outsider in my own house and do not know how much longer I can keep going. I feel for the kids, my fiance and their Mom but t gets frustrating when no one will get the help they so desparatly need.I have talked to my fiance about therapy for everyone concerned.e is all for it but his ex is fighting us on that issue and his daughters refuse it. What can I do to keep everything intact.I am not a worrier by nature but it is getting stressful....
