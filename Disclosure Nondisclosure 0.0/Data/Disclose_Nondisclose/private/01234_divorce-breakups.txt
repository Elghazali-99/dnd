We've been together for almost a year. Best times of my life. We were in love, we connected in a very emotional, physical and even spiritual ways. I have never been this intimate with anyone before. I was married with no kids when we met, now I'm separated, not because of him, I was just unhappy. But that changes the dynamic of things since he is still married. He is a lot older than I am and he has much more at stake to break up his marriage, with kids, business, etc. His relationship with his wife is similar to what I had with my ex, more like friendship and partnership but no romance, passion or sex. 
 He believes that we can have a long and happy affair when we were both married and unhappy. Now that I'm not, he does not want to be in a way of me finding someone I can start a new life with, especially if I want kids since he is past the age of having kids again, and he has had a vasectomy, not sure if it's reversible or not. I honestly not sure what I want. I feel like I need to choose between being with him but living with guilt, loneliness, fear, or starting a new life without him. What if I don't want a new life? What if I don't want kids? Then can I be with him forever? But even so there is always the risk of getting caught.
 I've tried breaking it off a few times in the past but always gave in and contacted him back. This time I hope it's for real. I feel somehow that he has made his decision by choosing not to leave his family for me, and I need to make mine by choosing not to live in a shadow for the rest of my life. But now realizing I might not see him, hold him, kiss him, talk to him ever again hurts so bad! 
 I don't really have anyone to share this with so it is really hard going through this without having a support system. Hoping maybe I can find that here with people who has been through what I have. Many thanks for reading this, any comments or suggestions are kindly appreciated.
