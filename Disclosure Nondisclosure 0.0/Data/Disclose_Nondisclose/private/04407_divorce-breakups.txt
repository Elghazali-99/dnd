I've been married now for 13 yrs, the wife and I have been on a up and down emotional ride untill now. She has been looking for this so called freedom in her life and seams to think that I prevent her from having!  Since the early part of our relationship I have given her my heart and sole but here in the past year she hit me with the I want a devorce! Back hand!
 We have done counceling just over a year now and still I see that im the only one that is willing to change!
I feel now that we have done the counseling that I don't care to be with her after hearing her tell me now that she is not sure if she could change for us and our family (2kids). 
 I now have told her that I was taking my personal earnings and putting it a solo account and that I would pay for half the bills and that she could do the same so that there would no longer be any dispute about money! Now for some strange reason she has been more tentative to the emotional and sexual desires that I've been looking for all these years and now I am dismissing her approach.
I look at this and say to myself, is this the only reason im here? Am I doing the right thing by withdrawing myself? Very sad if im right!
