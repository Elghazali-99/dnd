My bf has severe BPD and has finally accepted it and claims to be willing to get help. I wanted to stick by him and support him through it, but he has been so abusive to me both emotionally and physically (which causes me to retaliate in a similar manner and become an abuser myself, giving him the ammo with which to place all of the blame on me) that I'm not sure I can hang in there. Last night he nearly choked me to death several times and threatened to kill me. This was the first real instance of physical abuse, as it has been all verbal in the past. 
 I'm taking myself out of the situation by leaving town, but I feel like that may hurt him more than help his condition. I want to help because he's expressed the desire to help himself, but I just don't know what to do. Should I cut off all contact with him? Should I remain his friend and try and be there for him despite our temporary (possibly permanent) separation? Sometimes I'm not sure he loves me for who I am but rather can't stand the idea of being alone. Thx.
