I am moving, I not only have BPD but I also have multiple personalities. I Have been with my current psychiatrist for 11 years and our relationship is now coming to an end. He is probably the best relationship I have ever had with the opposite sex, I have always felt very close to him and we have always had a good relationship. In the past year I have become very aware of my other personalities and it has made my life very difficult to live. I have actually felt like I'm I'm getting worse than better. He has told me in the last couple of months there is nothing he can do to help me. So last week during our session he asked me if I was going to miss him and I switched into a young child, I don't remember much only that I walked out of his office while he was yelling at me where are you going! Yesterday I spoke to him and  I had taken an overdose the following day and he said that if I had been seeing a private psychiatrist they would have told me they wouldn't see me anymore because of my horrible behavior, cause I never called him that day to let him know if I was dead or alive? What do u think Don't u think he should have been the one to call me? Cause when I told him that he said "so u think this is my fault u took an overdose?" But in the state I was in who asks am I going to miss him? Isn't that an obvious answer?
