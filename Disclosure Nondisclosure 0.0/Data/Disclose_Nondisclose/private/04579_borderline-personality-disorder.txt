I feel like an idiot writing this note write now. But im going insane here. Its like 1.20 in the morning. Ive just took my sleeping pills but sleep is the last thing on my mind. I want to scream and run and shout and just do SOMETHING! I dont know what though. I don't know whats wrong with me. All the illnesses i have been diagnosed with do not say that this is a symptom, or the times when i feel i am going to blow up because my head will not stop buzzing? What is it all. Is there anyone here that understands what i mean? 
 I will go off into one of my attacks over the stupidest thing, someone saying something i dont like, even my faverouite person being kicked out of x-factor and il start. I just go to the floor, kick, scream and shout. Go mental. Before i was trying to make a sandwich and i couldnt get the cheese to cut right and i threw the whole plate. It was as though i had done something terrible. I was so angry at my self. It bubbles from my stomach and i just cant get the feelings through my mouth. They just stay stuck there and when i do try adn say something everything comes out backwards making no sense. I just want this to stop. I want my life back. I need to know what i can do.
 Im scared that people are after me, maybe not even people, im so lost and confused, yet some days i can function completley normally. I feel as though im not ill enough to be here but not well enough to be in the real world. But i can feel it all getting worse day by day. 
 I cant face more hospitals, Ive just turned 18 this means adult wards, if i dont get help from my community team im gonna get trapped in the system. This is such a rant i know, but i have no one elses to speak to right now, im grasping at straws just hoping one person will understand and say its this charley, suggest this? I dont know. All i know is im scared and i refuse to live like this any longer. If it doesnt get sorted im gone. This is no life x
