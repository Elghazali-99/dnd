So lately it's been one emotional roller coaster. I have had two miscarriages in the last year, bought a house and decided after the second miscarriage to get married. After the first pregnancy boyfriend wasn't so attentive but after the second one he was a bit more attentive to my needs. Needless to say here I am lonely, angry, sad and all alone. During the second pregnancy only a few people knew I was pregnant because I don't do well on the emotional side of managing feelings. My whole life (30 years) has been spent managing phony relationships with people. It's only now that I have acknowledged that. I was previously in a 12 year relationship that ended bad and even with that I had to be strong by myself. Now I just can't seem to be strong, crying, sleeping all day, not eating except one meal a day, now I even find myself wanting a drink and wishing I didn't have to work because more pretending I have to do. All I ever wanted was to be happy and even now in this new relationship (3 years) I can't seem to have that. I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to lose my bright and happy personality all while trying to maintain some self balance. Because right now I feel so off balance.
