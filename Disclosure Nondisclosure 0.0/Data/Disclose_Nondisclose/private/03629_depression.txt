I am doing job and have really nice family who support me. i was in california and just moved to phoenix, az. Since 23 september 2015 I can not sleep at night even for two hours. In morning i do jogging, Whole day I do job, in evening again i do exercise to tire my body so that i can sleep but it's in vain. I did try with little yoga and breathing and even i took aroma massage. i have read somewhere and accordingly i take warm milk before going into bed.  
i understand everything that stress has side effect on my body but my mind is continue in race, it doesn't stop for a minute and i couldn't sleep. my mind has lots of present and future thinking and worrying for my family. i dont know what to do. this happen first time with me. please help me out how can i sleep? i really want to sleep. if there is any OTC drug than let me know which i can use without any side effect for one or two day to get sleep (day before yesterday i took nyquil to get sleep but it did not work on me)
