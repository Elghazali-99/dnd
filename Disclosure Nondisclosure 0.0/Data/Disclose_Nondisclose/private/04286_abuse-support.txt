Hello all,
 I just joined this forum tonight.  And it's a very embarrassing topic that brings me here.  
 From 2 years old until 7 years old I was molested by my babysitter and her husband.  From my 10th to 11th year I was molested by my mother's boyfriend.  I've been raped three times.  When I was 19 I married an emotionally, mentally, physically, and sexually abusive man.  (I finally broke free of him at 26 - nearly 3 years ago.)
 So here's my issue that I want to talk about...
 I wet the bed.  Not every night, but often, more nights than not.  Many psychologists and psychiatrists over the years have told me that bed wetting is common among children who are molested.  
 I'm finally at a point in my life where things are going well.  I'm mostly happy.  But this bed wetting thing really brings me down, as you can imagine.  It's embarrassing, it's stinky, it's messy, it's horrible.  Worst of all though is that my boyfriend sleeps on the couch.  Obviously I completely understand why.  I don't resent him for that at all, believe me.  But I would love to finally get this problem under control so that we can sleep in the bed together.  
 What I am wondering is if any of you have dealt with this problem?  Do you currently deal with it?  Have you overcome it?  I know how embarrassing this is, so please feel free to PM me if you don't want to comment here.  
 Supportive comments are really appreciated, please don't make fun of me.  This was very difficult for me to write.
 Thank you.
