Hi
 Im 16 and i want to know if what i experaince is early Schizophrenia or something different, i have posted on another thred but thought this might help abit
 Right i just thought i would make like an overall idea on what i experaince - 
 Since i was about 10 i had strange thoughts of things going fast which led me me being depressed and scared, when i got slightly older certain songs used to worry me if they went fast, i was ok for a couple of years then as i was about 15 they came back but worse i used to imagine Everything going fast like random things, i couldnt see them i just imagined it and i knew it wasnt real, i got very scared and got put of my education, i went to see a doctor who said you will be fine in a couple of weeks, after a few months i went back and was reffered to a Mental Health worker / Counseler, working with her for about 8 seession, she informed me it could be due to my Car Crash i was invloved in and she said it was also anxiety and we practiced a few calming techniques, i didnt find this very helpful but it was nice of her, after about 4 months they came back but ithought worse, with these attacks i imagined the fast things but i could also imagine the whole world being like a fast roller coster, and i could imagine being shot back, i then could imagine situations going fast, i sometimes get sick with these situations and very lightheaded and dizzy, i also can get headaches and be very very scared, also very hot and cold and change of skin colour, i can get paranoid with this and sometimes rearely hear random thoughts in my head that could be songs or Words. 
 I still experainc e these things badly and feel i have no support whatso ever althought my family and girlfriend sometimes try to help it doesnt work i am now very negative about life but i am usually very happy and chatty 
  i am going back to the doctors in a couple of weeks
 Many thanks
 Callum
