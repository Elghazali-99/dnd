i am new here, so hello e1. i am 41 yrs of age..2 yrs ago i had surgery to remove cysts, fibroids, and scar tissue from the cervix which was almost closed because of the tissue. during surgery my right ovary was removed because there were 3 cysts on it. blood work b4 the surgery did not show pre-menopause, but 2 yrs later, blood work does show pre-menopause. every 2-3 months i seem to have abnormal periods, which scares me, so dr sent me to gyn (male). he was incredibly rude, basically told me he doubts the tests are correct because i am too young to be in pre- menopause. during surgery 2 yrs ago, i also had a biopsy of uterus, and 4 tissue sample tests done of everything in there...all was negative. this new gyn tells me he wants all these same tests done again...he said just becuz i didnt have cancer 2 yrs ago, dont mean i dont have it now :( i thought that was a rude way to put it. i asked him if pre-menopause can cause my periods to mess up, the show up on time, but i seem to spot several days after ( one month was everyday til next period) that period was normal...he said, i dont know, i guess i can. very snotty and rude. he wants to do a biopsy of uterus, and failed to tell me it hurts, so to take something b4 i get there !!! i understand i could have cancer after 2 years, but he has me soooo scared !!! he is also mad that my dr hasnt done a pap since the surgery ( 2 yrs.) my dr told me that it is recommended evry 2 yrs now if you have had 10 yrs of normal paps. so im confused and freaked out. did my dr give me wrong info, and could it be too late? could cancer be there and spread to other organs in this amount of time...i just had mammogram last month and it was normal, so thats 1 less worry. plz let me know what u think...and did having 1 ovary removed put me in pre-menopause? my mom had her last period ever at 43. so is this surgery induced, or am i following her?
