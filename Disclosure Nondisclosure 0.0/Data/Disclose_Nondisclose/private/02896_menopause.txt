Hi!
I have recently gone to see my ob/gyn in early May,suppose everything chkd out fine with the pap test..
I had asked him that lately my periods were getting lighter but still had it every month,do you think I am starting menopause? I am 47.He seemed to think I was to young for that yet,however my mother started at the young age of 41 n by 42 was completely done,my 3 older sisters were all in their 40s when they started n finished,so I didn't think it was to early for me to start at 47! in fact my sisters say that im the longest to start.
So he gave me a blood test to see if I am,the results came out that im post menopause! the very beginning.That to me means im NOT SUPPOSE to be having periods even being light right? but im having it every month although the discharge is brown like when your ending.
I have not panicked because I figured he would've called me if anything was wrong.No phone call.
 Just yesterday I began my period again like I do every month even if my numbers say im POSTMENOPAUSE.
I am scared this month because my period is heavy! as it hasn't been for a while now.
 I will call my doctor tomorrow,n see what he says,but has anyone had this problem or similar?
You all know what im thinking,the worse yes,cancer.
 HELP!!!!
