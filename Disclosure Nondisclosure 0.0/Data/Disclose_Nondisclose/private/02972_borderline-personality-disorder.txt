My ex is borderline - no doubt about it. We were together for about 2 years, lived together for the last half. We broke up the beginning of 2011 but she wanted to maintain a friendship and I wanted her to be happy with whoever she wanted to be with. Now, over a year later, we are still stuck. We have vacillated endless back and forth. Anytime she wants space I agree and try to give it to her but then doesn't want space and complains that I'm being mean. I'm completely exhausted, but I do love her and want to be there for her, but I want to move on as well. I feel in between a rock and a hard place and I guess I know what would completely solve it: to have no contact, but I don't know how to do that because I do love her and know I am her solid attachment in life at the moment. I'm still in love with her though and would be with her, but all she wants is friendship due to her believing being with another woman is wrong - which is kind of torture for me since I don't have a problem with it. This is just the short version of it...Anyway, encouragement? words of advise?
