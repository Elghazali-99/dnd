I have know my ex since I was 13 years old, and I am now 28 and he is 32. We have two children together ( 2 and 6). We have tried to reconcile several times and it doesn't seem to work because he is still a little immature, being lazy, not helping with chores around the house, etc. and I am a neat-freak who like things done a certain way. We have no infedelity issues (no cheating, etc.) but we have control issues over who wears the pants. We broke up again in August 2010, and since then we spend a lot of time together doing things with the kids. I am celibate and he does respect that part of me now. We spent Thanksgiving, Christmas, Birthdays, etc. It almost feels like a relationship just no sex! We even sometimes find ourselves cuddling next to one another. I told him a month ago that I would never attempt to reconcile with him ever and that I just wanted to be friends and since then I can't help but question is he the one, or am I being friends and doing all these activities with him to keep him close all the while missing out on the real man who God has for me? We have played this game for so long that now I don't even know how to tell him I still love him! We play this game of not showing feelings, but pining for each other in secrecy!  We both haven't been seeing anyone. I'm wondering are these feelings ones I should not ignore, or should I just move on and stay silent because this just isn't meant to be?
