I live with my boyfriend and his mother in a house I own. I am 29 years old and have discovered both him and his mother have symptoms of bipolar. She is being treated with Seroquel and he has yet to be seen by a doctor. I have made an appointment for him next month. When he wakes up in the mornings by an alarm or by me and not on his own, he gets very angry. He`ll throw his phone and say things like he might as well drive off a cliff. He slams doors threatens to kill the dog and cusses. Eventually he`ll say sorry, but this keeps happening in cycles. Sometimes he`s very angry at night as well. He started his laundry and fell asleep, so I asked if he wanted me to finish his laundry. He said I don`t *^(I^(%! care if you throw it away! ...Its seems when he gets depressed he gets angry and when his mom is depressed she crys and crys over the littlest things. I`m so stressed out my hair has been falling out so much my hair stylist said I should see a doctor to check my thyroid. Anyway...my question is is his behavior abuse? It keeps happening and it makes me so angry, but I keep my mouth shut so he doesn't get angrier.
