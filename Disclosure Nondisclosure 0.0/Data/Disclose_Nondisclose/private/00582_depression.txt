Hi everyone.Im 23 and i suffer from anxiety,PD,GAD,OCD ,agoraphobia,socialphobia for a long time.My problem its that im engaged and im together with my fiance for 6 years now.I told him about my mental/emocional problems but he just can't understands me,he says ''its all in ur mind,just don't thing about it''.Everytime he invites me to go to his family my anxiety get WORSTTTTT ,i say i can't come but he forced me to go and say ''are u comming  or im gonna leave u''i mean he is so selfish ...but when  i go ,i'm afraid im going to do things out of control or i'm going to be crazy and hurt somebody (which i never could do in normality) than my anxiety goes in higher levels.I asked him to help me to deal with it but he doesn't even care,just says you have to do things that make u anxiety and face them,but I CAN'T.He said that we have to marry next year but im not ready to do it.Should i broke up with him,even i can't live without him because he is my first boyfriend and if i broke up ,here where i live im gonna be judged from everyone.I have no support from anyone,even my family.I'm lost,I'm tired of this life :'(
