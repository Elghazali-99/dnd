Hi, maby someone here can help me Im 20 years old(female) now but when I was about 6 years old me and a older female cousin(by almost 2 years) would spend the summers together. I recall being very confused the first time I was sexually abused by my cousin. She was a bit bigger than me and a bully. I was scared so when she said to never speak a word of it I didnt because at times she would even hit me if I made her was mad enuff. After awhile I begin to become very shy, didnt talk much and didnt like to be out of site of my parents. The most trubling experience I remmbr is when we move into a different neighborhood.  I than met my now longtime childhood friend. One weekend my cousin, friend and I had a sleepover and my cousin said lets play a game we all agreed. We built a fort and went inside she told my friend to take her clothes off and I knew right where "the game" was heading... She made me take mine off to and she made us both do oral and she hit me with a belt because I begged her not to do it to my friend. I was afraid she would tell her mom and we all get in trouble and my cousin
