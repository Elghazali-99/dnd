My family is the best thing that ever happen to me, then my relatives are the worse thing that ever happen to me, growing up the people (my friends and relatives) around me made me think I was ugly so I was in the trance of believing I am ugly so as the time pass i would dropp my friends  and avoid my relatives, then I turn 18 in which everyone thinks i am hot but mean because I hold so many grudge against everyone that ever did me wrong and through it all, i've become a great actress and an excellent liar.So I try my best to stay away from mean people and get on the computer and chat alot but someone called me a N _ _ _ _ r and i feel awful and everytime something like this happen i feel like hiding myself away from the world. i don't want to be mean any more, i don't want to act anymore, i don't want to lie anymore i just want to be a good person but eveyone just push it. I have act so much when someone I know die I dont know if i'm crying or pretending to cry.
  Please please help
