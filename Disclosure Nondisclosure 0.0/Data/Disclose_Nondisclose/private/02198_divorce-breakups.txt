Hi,
 My girlfriend recently went through a case. She told me it was because her son was turning 16 and her husband filed so she couldn't possess the new car he was getting bought by his father. I didn't believe it and searched the public records. This came up. This was only a week process. This surely couldn't be a full divorce could it? Is this just a follow up on a previously filed divorce?
