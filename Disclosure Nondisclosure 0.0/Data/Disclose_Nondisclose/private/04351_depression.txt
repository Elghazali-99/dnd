Ive been suffering from severe depression and anxiety for a while now. Though most of it stemms from my past, and im not quite ready to open that pandoras box.  My question, however, is my doc prescribed me Lexapro and Abilify, i need to know if aanyone out there who has taken these meds can tell me what side effects to expect and how long does it take to get into my system.  I have not taken the Ablilify yet, cause, quite frankly im scared to.  Having not been able to find anything on it besides what clinical side effects "might" be, im leary to take it.  The lexapro ive been on just over 6 days now, and i am also curious as to whether anyone else felt seemingly more depressed when fist taking it.  Also, as personal as this is, did anyone notice any sexual side effects, as in, im finding it harder to achieve orgasm.  Anyway i know im rambling and thanks in advance for any and all help you give.
 Take Care

P.S Should i start taking the abilify and you think it will help lvl out the roller coaster ride i seem to be on emotionally?
