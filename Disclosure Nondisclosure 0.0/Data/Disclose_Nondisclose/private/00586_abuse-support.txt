Hi i'm a 17 year old girl. and i don't know whats happening. I've lately had to undergo some therapy for depression, and I've had a lot of memories brought back up. A lot of them have to do with my father whom I have a ice thin relationship with. Anyways when I was younger I had to live with my dad during the weekdays and my mom on the weekends. Now its reversed. So I've recently been starting to think if my father loves me too much. When i was younger he always wanted to be taking naps with me, I would either sleeping on his chest or next to him, he liked to hold me. He also use to cut my hair up until i was in 5th grade, he'd make me strip of my clothes while he cut my hair. My dad is always telling me how much he loves me, he always wants to be near me, and is very possessive of his time with me. He'll sometimes make comments on how big my butt or boobs are. He'll even say that if he were my age he would love to be dating me. He always calls me his love. If I'm trying to lay on the couch he'll grab my ankles and lay them across his lap and hell stroke my legs. He always tries to bring sex up with me. He still comments that after a scary movie if i'm scared i can come sleep in his room. When we go on vacations he'll always get a king size bed, he says its big enough for us to share. I always sleep on the pull out sofa though. he will sometimes will be trying to tickle me and he'll always move toward my butt area. I once said i was too hot, and he said "well do you have the hots for me" Hes always saying he loves me soo much. I don't know maybe i'm being paranoid, i'm no expert but is any of this weird or.
