I dated a man for a while who, after we broke up, became my best friend. He has a lot of "issues" to say the least! His wife left him for another man, the wanted him back, then ran him off again when she got back with the man she dumped him for in the first place and yet he says he still loves her so very much but at times he is so hostile towards her. He'll hate someone for a while and next thing you know, the person who "wronged" him is the next best thing to sunshine. I have at times been joking with him about something and he will feel that I have somehow "assaulted" him and was trying to hurt him or embarrass him, which couldn't be further from the truth. He will get incredibly angry, talk to me like a dog and then beg forgiveness after he calms down. He also gets angry if he thinks he has hurt someone (emotionally) and then hurts himself, usually by punching himself in the face or mouth or ramming his head into the wall. He is fairly untruthful at times and I think he's somewhat promiscuos though he denies it to the hilt. He says sometimes that he wants to die but that he would never kill himself because of his religious beliefs. Otherwise, he is one of the nicest people you'd ever want to meet. Very intelligent, witty & funny. So, does this sound like BPD?
