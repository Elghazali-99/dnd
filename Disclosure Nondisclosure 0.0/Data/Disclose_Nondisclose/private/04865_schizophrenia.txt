My husband has been acting very paranoid lately.  It all started with him feeling pressure across his chest (ribcage), loss of appetite, then he began to feel that he was being watched.
 After the first week, his chest began to feel better and he regained some of his appetite but the intensity of his paranoia increased.  I have taken him to see our family doctor but was told that his symptoms were stressed related and that he should do exercise.  That didn't make any sense.  My husband has always been active and before all these he was doing exercise every day.  Started from the second week he could no longer drive his own car (he's using my car), sleep in his own bedroom, or go anywhere without me.  Now he believes the police is after him and that our house is being bugged!  He even considers going to the police station with his lawyer to ask why he was being followed.  
 I read his family history and don't recall seeing any records of mental illness.  His mother did have a short episode of paranoia while she was very ill in the hospital but she recovered shortly after.  She is now suffering from dementia but she is almost 90 years old.
 I am feeling very helpless because our family doctor doesn't think his condition is serious enough to see a specialist.  But I can see my husband's symptoms get worse by the day.  
 Is he suffering from paranoia schizophrenia, or I am too being overly paranoid?
