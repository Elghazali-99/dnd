About 1 year ago I stopped taking Effexor XR and Depakote ER a little too quickly (I had been taking these drugs for 12 years, and had reached the max dose at this time) and was thrown into hellish withdrawals. Even with the help of Prozac I could only stand this for 2 months. I was given Cymbalta 30mg to stop the withdrawals. Three months ago I went into my dr. complaining of extreme fatigue and confusion. Dr. assumed it was merely depression and doubled my dose (I should mention that at this time I was attempting to combat the fatigue with caffeine and was up to 4-5 cups of coffee per day). HUGE mistake. My symptoms suggested serotonin toxicity; I had to stop after 4 days at this dose. I have quit coffee, but since then I have been unable (I am not exaggerating) to take even the smallest bit of Cymbalta without the horrible symptoms returning. My body is also unable to handle minute doses of any drug or substance that acts on the nervous system (examples: alcohol, ibuprofen, certain herbs). I have no choice but to quit Cymbalta cold turkey. This frightens me as I know that sudden withdrawal will be hard on my already compromised nervous system.....I need help as I feel I am running out of time.
