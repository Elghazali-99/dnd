I'm 17 years old and in the past 5 months I've tried 5 different antidepressants. They all turned out horrible and made my social anxiety and depression much worse. I'm currently on my 6th medicine, Lamictal, and am terrified to increase the dose. I'm at 25mg, which my psychiatrist said is an extremely small dose, but I don't want to increase it. It's not helping me at the current dose and I'm still severely depressed. I think I'm sensitive to these medicines and that's why I wish I could stop taking them. However, my therapist assured me that trying all of these antidepressants will eventually pay off and I will find one that works. I still have my doubts because it seems every single medicine I've taken has done more bad than good. The first one I tried, Lexapro, made me feel like I was going insane. I could go on and on about the horrible feelings that medicine gave me, so I'll just say I haven't been the same after taking it. I only tried the following 4 antidepressants because I was still hoping I would find the right one. Now, I'm losing hope and don't know what to do. 
I've had a therapist for a while now and every time we meet it's basically me expressing how worried I am about what's happening to me. Whenever I actually have a therapy session, I feel frustrated. All of the methods she's teaching me seem useless. I know how to take deep breathes and how to think differently in situations. I just can't control my anxiety/depression anymore. 
My mother mentioned hypnosis as a treatment of depression and I was curious if anyone has any information on this. Also, is there anything else I can be doing to help myself? I've tried meditation and exercise, as well. I'm seeking relief at this point and I'm willing to do almost anything. I never knew that it was so difficult finding an antidepressant that works for you. The past few months have been hell for me and I just want to feel better in any way possible.
