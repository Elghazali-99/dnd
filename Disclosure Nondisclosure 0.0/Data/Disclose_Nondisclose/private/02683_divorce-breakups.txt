I'm a illigal inmigrant  and my boyfriend knew  this from he beginnin, I didnt want to get in a realtionship for the same reason but we both fall in love, he is great and he always said I make him happy that i support him as nobody have including his own family and i felt same about him I love him so much, he knows me and my family here in USA and also know I wasn't never behind anything in specific(thats what he said),  he is a musician I'm a photographer we have lot in common we had so much fun and always could talk about anything I help him in all i could I couldn't  been more sincere with him... after two years I'm deciding what to do with my life and i want to hear how he felt, he said he love me but he has limits and he wouldn't move in with or married me just because he was afraid that this would destroy are beautiful relantionship?  i can't stay forever here under this circunstances. last nite we had a very emotional breackup from wich I'm feeling lost, terrible sad and disappointed. Is not the first time we talkd about it but we always  try to put the subject in the side and try to enjoy what we had but we never had a final decision but it is the first time he mentioned about having those limits and standing so sure about all the marriage thing and i can't even blame him for that or me its just how things happened but if the situation was reverse I'll do anything for keep him wt me... I'm so sad i miss him so much already we had cpl chats douring the day and we both feel miserable but i dont know what to do/ seems like i won't have a happy ending with him and neither if I leave but i wont deny i feel that he give up on me and our relantionship...and i think he's no telling everything? or  is he expecting me to put all this in the side again who knows for how long?...  I'm just lookin for an oppinion or advice, thanks
