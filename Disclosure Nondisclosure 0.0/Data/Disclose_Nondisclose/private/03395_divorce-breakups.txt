I have been married since a year and a half. My husband and my MIL were too good in the beginning. i felt as if i am the most luckiest person as it was a second marriage for both of us and a quite late one. But slowly my mother in law started poisoning my husband that i dn't value him and since i am more educated than him, i always try to boss on him. Morevover, though i am working woman, i am not allowed to spend money for my own comforts. MIL is totally superstitious  and believes in lot of blind faiths. She stopped talking to me without any reason 8 mths back. Refused to touch food that i cooked and made my husband cook for her right in front of me. She got operated and i was nt informed. My husband has no guts to say anything to her. He is totally mama's boy. After a certain point of time, i ws so frustrated that i tried commiting suicide. After that I was driven out of house through false talks and nw they want me to giv in writing that whatever i did  was my fault and they are no where involved. I am staying seperately since last two mnths. My parents were called and there was a heated argument where lot of things were said. I love my husband and called him and agreed to all his conditions but still he is nt ready giving any clear ans. I spoke to my MIL and apologised but she bad-mouthed me. Please guide me what to do?
