My mother has always been obsessed with my brothers she thinks we are just slaves to serve them, She is very wealthy and wants my brothers to succed, she uses all her power to achieve it she excuses everything to them and make me resposable for everything. 
I am a very good person and have done very well investing my wealth and have a lots of friends and a stable family with much love from my children and grandchildren I was terrorized by her last year I went to see her and my jealous sister was there and when I tried to talk to my mother explaining her may sister came in and try to hit me and again my mother thinks I was responsible for the event also she has been manipulated from a doctor that does not likes me because I speak out the bad things he does he lets my mother go to an extreme in her blood pressure to after tell everybody she ows him her life
Last year after the incident she had some guard for four months at the entrance so I could not visit her and with my sister wrote a letter saying do not call or visit her and she said to my family the doctor does not let her see me then I decided not to go never again I just have been nice sending flowers and presents on her birthday but she now again talked with everybody my friends and family making me responsable for not visiting her and saying the security person was not for me I have been very very sad I cant think about it without crying but I just do not think and just see all the good things I have but she is old and my sons say I will regret if I do not visit her if she someday pass away but she insist to make me responsible for all bad things in her life and I have done absolutly nothing
I have tried not to get caught and not to respond any agresion I am nice but just do not go anymore.
