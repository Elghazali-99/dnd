I have been in a relationship for the past 2 years.  At first this man was as close to being perfect as can be.  Charming, sweet, generous...the kind of guy everyone would want to be with. To make a long story short...I found out after 1 year of being with him (and moving in with him) that he has been lying to me about EVERYTHING since the day we met!!  I confronted him and made him admit his lies to me and I told him I would try to close this chapter and start a new one if he promised to stop the lying.  
He did okay at first and then I started to notice that he was lying to me again!  I think he's a pathological liar.  He not only lies...he spends ALL his money on nothing!!  He's totally irresponsible!
I have become very "turned off" by him and am unable to be intimate with him.  I'm not even able to kiss him or hug him anymore and I told him this.  I told him not to touch me because I can't give him what he wants from me as far as affection and intimacy go.  
A couple of nights ago...I woke up to him touching me everywhere as though I was awake!  He was even talking as though I was awake!  It scared me and I didn't know what to do, so I pretended to be asleep and thought he would stop but he didn't...he just kept touching and kissing me everywhere.  I'm freaked out by this man and I have mentioned to him that I think it would be better if we broke up.  He was very upset and again when I was sleeping, he was talking to me and he mentioned that he can't live without me and that he would kill himself.  
I'm don't know what to do or how to go about breaking up with him...does anyone out there have any suggestions...has anyone ever gone through something like this?
