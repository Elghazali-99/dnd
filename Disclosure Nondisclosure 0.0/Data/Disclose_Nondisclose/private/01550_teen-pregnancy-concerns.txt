i had intercourse for the first time (6 days ago) and only 4 days afterwards i started feeling the constant urge to urinate but i would only pee blood (light red) this really scared me. I am currently in a country where sex before marriage is a huge taboo so i don't have access to any doctors that i can trust and would not cause me loads of trouble. Anyways, after freaking out i started drinking loads of fluids because i thought it may be a bladder infection ? and i think it worked because that same day i didn't have any symptoms anymore. however i'm still concerned. One thing i almost forgot to mention; we used a condom but didn't use one the first couple of 20 seconds. he did not ejaculate though. My questions are; How likely is it that i am pregnant ? and what can you tell me about the bloody urine that i frequently had for one day, four days after having intercourse? 
 Any advice would help a great bunch since i am very scared right now and am not able to think straight. The fact that i can't tell anyone in my community because of the consequences it could have on my safety makes everything worse too.
