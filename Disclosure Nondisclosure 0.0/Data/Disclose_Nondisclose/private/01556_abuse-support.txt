I can remember being a bad person.But after compliants and request for change by my former girfriend ,I progressively changed.Now so much -that my former life is gone.Evrything I do is for her or her family and somehow I never am left time for mine.I isolate my self from her whenI can-I have totatlly emersed myself in work.I faer the public and walking around outside of work I feel lost.I tried dating but cannot relax , I feel inadiquate.I feel completely at a loss as I used to ***** in traffic now hardly out of fear=it causes war when I do and everything stops ie nothing gets done. 
 I should point out -I am living seperated from this person but feel I cannot affford a place on my own. We are supposed be renovating to sell-always something being added.Now I feel like I can do nothing right.I am told I am stupid ,retarded-crazy,not a man.
 In spite of all this _ she drags me everywhere-like I am her boy friend-but no perks .
 I think I know the answer to this but-I need resorces -bad _I think I am losing grip.
 I feell like I cannot leave her -she has no one -dying parents and she was abused as a child( not by family)
 your thoughts- I have no money so please do not ask-I support two kids from a previous marriage( wife decided to cheat with mt best friend.( yeah just keeps getting bettter.
