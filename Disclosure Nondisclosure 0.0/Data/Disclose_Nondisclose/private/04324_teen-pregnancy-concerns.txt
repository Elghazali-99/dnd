Warning: Very intimate content, sorry. So I started my period May 30, 2014. Now keep in mind my periods are fairly normal they are usually very heavy and come at the same time each month. well it came at the same time but started noticing symptoms of pms I guess, a couple weeks earlier normally, its only one week earlier. Also on May 26 my fiance and I took a shower together but he didn't penetrate me. He tried though. And Friday when I started it we had sex(sorry tmi), we also had sex yesterday Monday June 2, 2014 and same shower deal again. Well my period was only heavy for two days this time, I'm now on day 5 and all I've had today was just Brown (old blood I'm guessing) but I still feel sick, I'm nauseous, I have an upset stomach my boobs are swollen and a little sore, I have body aches, I'm bloated like crazy, my body is warm and I have had diarrhea all day. we had sex today also, June 4th, 2014, and I look down and I'm bleeding. Not a lot of blood just a little but still. He uses a condom because it's not a good time for us to have a baby, I'm in school and he's about to get deployed plus I lost my job and am living with my parents soo yeah. Is there a chance I'm pregnant or do I just have lady probs?
