So I will give u a quick background check of me, I'm a 36yr old female and have been suffering from panic and depression since I was 17... I didn't leave my house for almost 3 yrs unless I was with my mother(safety blanket).. Ended. Up getting over that without meds :-) yay me lol.. Fast forward to 2005, my son was born he's perfect but I wasn't, when he was about 4 months old I started getting extremely depressed and tons of anxiety.. I couldn't cope so the dr put me on celexa, it worked amazing :-) was on that for about 8yrs alittle depression while on. It but nothing to bad, I musta got immune to it cuz it just wasn't helping anymore, so my dr switched me to cipralex, which I've been on now for over a year... So in the past yr, I've gotten extremely depressed, it will last about a week then go away... Now skipping to dec 20th, wake up, sit up, and the whole room starts spinning on me :-( of course started having a severe panic attack cuz I didn't no wtf was wrong with me.. Find out almost a month later that I had a sinus infection that caused vertigo, I dealt with the dizziness for a month which really sucked cuz my anxiety was through the roof...Fast forward alittle bit again, into February now, for the past 3 days I feel like absolute crap!!!!!!!!!!! I'm off balanced(alittle) foggy head, extremely tired, my mom sys stress but I feel like something is wrong with me.. It almost feels like I'm alittle hungover, even the thought of having a cig makes me nauseous, I feel like my hands are retaining water.. Ugh just wish it was easier to explain cuz I just can't take it anymore,,, I no u guys will say to go c my dr. But when I feel like this, I don't wanna go anywhere, or do anything but sleep..  Plzzzzzzzzzz someone help,my am I feeling like this??????
