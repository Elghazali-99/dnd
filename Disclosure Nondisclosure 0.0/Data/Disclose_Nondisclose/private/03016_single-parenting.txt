i say newly single but the relationship i had with my ex was full of issues, control and verbal abuse were common place which resulted in myself never being able to trust him and so the relationship was on and off a lot...i would be determined to get out of the cycle, but through lack of confidence would always go back, he was incredibly charismatic, persuasive and said exactly what i needed to hear. It is only now that i am finally breaking free that i can see the level of manipulation and the hold he had over me, scary!
 anyway im writing here as being single now brings more parenting issues along with it, i have a son of 10yrs, and 2 daughters, 1 is 7yrs and the other is 3. My son is now starting to deal with his anger the same way my ex partner did, by calling names and exploding! and my two daughters continually bicker and whine at me.
 I am struggling and feel i really need an action plan as were at a junction and i feel they are testing their boundaries with me, and it could go two ways, we are coming together more as a family and i have made real efforts to be pro-active in there social lives as i have just learnt too drive, im taking them swimming and bringing along their friends, inviting their friends round for tea after school, driving to the park etc, which is going well but flipside to this they seem to be testing me more and im struggling with how to deal with the constant argueing between them, sibling rivalry and lack of respect.  
 We  moved when the relationship ended and returned to our old home town which we  had left because my partner didnt like it, so although they know kids and have friends here, theres been a lot of change and disruption for them recently.
 Basically i would love some tips in effective punishments..i find i just end up ranting and raving and am feeling quite out of my depth being assertive and making them  see i mean bussiness, i make excuses for their bad behaviour and in the long run am not doing them or myself any favours so...
any help would be appreciated thanx
