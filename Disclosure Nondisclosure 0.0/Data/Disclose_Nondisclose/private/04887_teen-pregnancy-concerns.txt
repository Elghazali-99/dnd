I was on birth control for three months, then my fianc√© and I decided we wanted to make a child. I stopped my pills before the third pack ended, and we immediately began the process. It's been a little over a month and I have taken two negative tests. However, I have not had a period. I've been having these symptoms: swollen and sore breasts, odd cravings, nausea, cramping in the pelvic area, constantly having to pee, constantly hungry, slight headaches and sudden imbalance... Today, however, I had slight bleeding, more of a light pink looking fluid, but barely any of it at all. I was wondering if the tests could have been false negatives, the first test I took was near the beginning of the process and the second one was a week ago. The last one I took, I swear I could see two lines but one was VERY faint. Any ideas/suggestions? Also, I am taking prenatal vitamins as a precaution and they are pink. Could they be the cause of the pink fluid? And do you think I could be pregnant?
