When I was sixteen I was heavily into drugs and drinking not to mention promiscuity.
But while at a friends apartment late at night, there were two other people there besides my friend ryan who owned the apartment.
The boy Sam who was 19 at the time, has always been a little to close for my comfort, but I never thought to much of it.
That night we had bought a case of beer and while I had two or three (I'm an extreme light-weight), Sam only sipped on one.
 I knew I was drunk because I kept crashing into walls, after the second crash into the wall, Sam offered to take me to Ryan's room to sleep.
At this point, Ryan and the other girl that was there were gone in search of a gas station that's still open so Sam and I were alone.
I said no a few times, but I finally obliged because I was just to tired to argue.
 Sam helped me into Ryan's room, and layed me on his bed before walking to the door and shutting off the lights. I closed my eyes and heard the door lock so I assumed Sam has left and locked the door.
 That was until I felt his arm under my legs, lifting me so I was on the other side of the bed.
He than started kissing me and touching me but I was so tired. I didn't say anything because I was scared, I didn't know what he was doing, or if he knew that I didn't want it.
 I passed out, and woke up with him ontop of me. I wanted to get him off but I was to tired to move so I went back to sleep.
When I woke up again he was still there, bbut by this time I was a little more awake so I pushed him off and got up to put my clothes on.
 I have vivid memory of taking my pants and underwear off, which makes me wonder if this still qualifies as rape or If I'm right and it's just drunken sex.
 Can anybody help with this?
