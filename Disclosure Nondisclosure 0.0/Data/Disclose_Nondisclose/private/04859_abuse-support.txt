 Ok, so I was roofied.  I blacked out and was without my friends for approximately 40 minutes.  Toward the end of 40 minutes I remember sitting outside--a stranger was comforting me (i.e. hand on back) telling me it was going to be ok.  I *think* I tried to kiss him and he refused.  I remember passing out, outside by myself.  I was outside of a bar and my friends were inside.  Him and my friend talked on my cell phone (I don't know who called who) and he told her she needed to go get me.  She did.  The next morning I had no bruises, scrapes, and my clothes were intact.  (I bruise very easily) There was vomit on my shoes.  I didn't *feel* like I had been raped.   But I don't remember anything in those 40 minutes and no one I know was there to fill in the blanks.  Do you think it's possible to be raped without any physical signs (e.g. bruises) and without *feeling* like you were?  Thank you for you help.
