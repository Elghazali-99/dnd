How many voices do you hear ? for me it's usually 3 talking amongst themselves and at times about me  and to me , they become nasty and degrading ( teasing me and stuff like that ) sometimes too .Other time's it's like being in a busy shopping centre inside my head , i also find it hard to tell the difference between racing thoughts when i'm a little manic and the voice's , it all just sounds like loud  noice , I just recently got diagnosed with Schizoaffective , but for the last few years it was bi polar 2 and social anxiety , and avoidant personality disorder , but the thing is i've alway's experienced psychosis on and off even if it's only mild sometime's but i seem to get it worse when depressed , i hear voice's ,dog's barking, phones ringing ,cars pulling up ...etc and really paranoid of detective's and government spy's putting me under surveilance and following me every where i go , and i sometimes hear the wrong things when people are talking to me and have to ask them to repeat themselves . i even think everbody in the shops are looking at me , talking bout me ,even the laughter is at me also . 
 I guess i'm wondering if anyone have simmilar **** happening to them ?.
