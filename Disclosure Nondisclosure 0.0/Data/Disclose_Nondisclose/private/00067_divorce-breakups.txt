My husband and I have been married for 10yrs, 20 yrs all together, teenage loves.  Last year in May I found out that he is talking to a female from a dating website.  This female is herself in an open marriage with 2 kids.  I confronted my husband about it but he refused to stop talking to her bc she is his friend.  We have been fighting about this for 8 months, I have allowed this to go on, he takes her out on dates every Friday night. He wants to be in an open marriage with me and I refuse so in my mind he is openly cheating on me.  He calls her his girlfriend now and tells me I need to respect his girlfriend and their relationship. fast forward to this month, on Jan 1st of this year he texts me and asked how I would feel if he wanted to go and spend a few nights a week with her at her home.  I said no way!!  Things have gotten worse, so now I have rented a townhome for myself and I'm separating myself from the situation.  Should I feel guilty for leaving him?  Bc he now is saying I'm walking out on our marriage.  So I'm really confused.
