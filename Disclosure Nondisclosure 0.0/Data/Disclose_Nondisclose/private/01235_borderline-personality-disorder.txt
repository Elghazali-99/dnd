My sister and I are really struggling to find proper support for our borderline mother.  For the past decade our mom has been unable to hold down a job because she causes too many problems with her colleagues once she does land a job.  At this point she has not worked in nearly four years, she lost her apartment and is now living with my recently married sister and brother-in-law in their 1-bedroom apartment.  For the past year my sister and I have tried to help my mom find a job to no avail.  She dismisses our advice and when she does land a job interview, she blows it--every time.  My mom consistently lies to my sister and brother-in-law and she will burst into fits of rage if they confront her about her lies.  Growing up is the same as it was with any borderline parent: verbally abusive, manipulative, and distant.  I'm 32 years old and I still feel I don't know who my mom really is.  Neither myself nor my sister can afford to send my mom to a home or even for proper medical care.  My mom is 52 and does not qualify for any state (California) or federal benefits because it is extremely difficult to "prove" BPD.  Last time I was there I took her to the county Dept of Behavioral Health, but they have only prescribed her with anti-depressants.  They also offered group therapy but apparently she is no longer welcome to these sessions (my sister could not get a real explanation from my mom about what happened).  We are all at wits end with my mom.  We just don't know how to help her.  She can't continue living with my sister (I moved far away long ago in fear that my mom would end up living with me) and we cannot put her out into the streets as she is still our mom.  
 Any advice on how we can move forward would be sincerely appreciated.
