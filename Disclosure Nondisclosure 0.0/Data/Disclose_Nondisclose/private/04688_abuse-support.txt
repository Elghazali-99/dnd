She is a diffrent child after visitation with her father who sexualy abused her. I really don't know how to help or handle her behavior i have tried many things. One of the behaviors is she zones out and acts very sad and presses on her privates and lays around. She will even do this in public. She will immedeatly crawl under the waiting room chairs were people are seting at the doctors or anywere and do this. she refuses to move and if i tryto get her to stand up she stays lemp.Also I am unable to get her to sleep in her own bed she use to when the visitation stoped but now she wakes up at least 8 times a night and screams and says she is skird and it takes me a good 30 minutes to calm her down. When she starts screaming it wakes her sister up and then I have to screaming kids.She seems to want me to help. She seems very skird and angry she starts trying to hit me and huet herself ner the end of it then she calms down.This is such a small portion of what is going on I could write a book
