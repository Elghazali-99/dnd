I feel like the only thing left to do is die. I can't go through this life anymore. I'm all by myself carrying the weight of the world or at least it feels like it. I got into a huge fight with my boyfriend all because I asked him not to go out with any girls tonight. he goes and says "well u live with random people so what difference does it make " all because my parents take in foster kids. I can't control that at all! and I've begged my parents a million times not to do it anymore because it makes me uncomfortable. when my bf was dropping me off at home a foster kid we used to have that comes over occasionally was on the front porch and he instantly was mad because that person has made passes at me before. I've asked my parents to not have him over but I''ve never told my mom exactly why. when I got inside I asked her why he was he're and etc and finally told her and she told me I was lying. this is exactly why I never said anything in the first place because no one will believe me! then my mom goes and tells me I'm crazy and all this other **** about how awful I am and etc. of course I was just as mean back. but I told her I'm so depressed and want to kill myself and she does not care. it makes me feel like I should just do it since no one cares anyway. I have no friends so it's not even like someone would miss me. this is just so hard and I'm giving up I feel like the best thing to dois just end my life. iI ffeel even dumber writing this here but I have no one to confide in. I'm just so lost right now I just don't know how to ever get my strength back..
