I went out Saturday night with my friend. She and I had a drink at a bar, and ventured down to a different one . Met a group of guys there, and they bought drinks and shots for me and my friend.  They invited us to a club, they had the vip room reserved and had bottles of vodka. We followed. I normally drink like a champ and I handle my beer/mixed drinks/ shots fine and dandy- I'm talking after 10 -15 drinks i may be sloshed but I'm coherent and I remember everything. I had two red bulls and vodka and I don't remember anything past that. Complete black out. I woke up the next morning at my apt, my dogs food bowl on the ground next to me with vomit in it...all my clothes were on. some random guy  from the group of guys Saturday night was asleep on my couch, fully clothed but his shoes were in my bedroom. I am absolutely spazzing out.
 This is what was told me that happened:
 He says my friend accused him of drugging me and he swears he didn't.  She admitted to screaming at him after she cleaned me up accusing him of roofie-ing me. I apparently was exiting waste from both ends for 20 plus minutes in the bathroom.I couldn't walk, speak or stand up without assistance. She cleaned me up and we took a cab home but apparently he had my keys so his friends dropped him off to give us my keys but left him there. My friends let him stay and crash at my place- told him to not touch me and to sleep on the couch and then they left apparently. 
 So from midnight Saturday night  to 8:30 am the next day I have no clue what happened.. I'm racking my brain... my clothes were on...my skirt was hiked up but i attributed that to tossing in my sleep. my undergarments were intact but you never know...
 I'm shaking and trying to not cry.
