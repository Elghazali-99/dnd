Hey there, 
I'm a 20 something teenage male. I have no history of serious health problems and there's no history of mental illness in my family. I have some serious questions. 
 I shake on a regular basis. My hands shake often and are often accompanied with feelings of nervousness, paranoia and downright negativity. When the feelings intensify (only after caffeine), my lip often begins shaking as well and I start to act really crazy. Obviously, this is a little concerning to me.   
 On the flip side, sometimes I will experience a state which is similar but very different to the one described above. It's a feeling accompanied by no shaking but similar extremely fast thoughts. I usually can't stop focusing on everything and anything no matter how small. I read and process massive amounts of information in a very short period of time (I'm an extremely fast reader) and I find I remember almost everything I learn in this period. I mean, my reading comprehension seems to go through the roof when compared to normal as well as my work ethic and level of focus. 
 I've never been in a fight or for that matter committed any violent acts (except for towards my brothers of course:P) but the issue is in how it makes me feel. I hate the first feeling and love the second. Has anyone experienced anything so bizarre as this before?
