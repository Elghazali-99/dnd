I married( love marriage) last year.just after my marriage, i saw too much closeness between my husband and his brother's wife(bhabhi). I saw bhabhi exposing to a great deal infont of my husband, sitting very close to him and wanted to all work of wife. She didnot like me being close to my husband. She complained to MIL that my husband didnot give her time. When i yold my insecurities to my husband, he raised hands on me and told me that he can leave me but not his bhabhi. Then his mom always pesters me. Taunts me for dowry, forces my husband to go to his bhabhi and tells me bhabhi has all rights over him. She blames me, abuses me and my mother. She wants us to divorce and forces my husband to divorce me. On top of these, my FIL embraced and kissed me on lips many times alone and when i told him i dont like, he told why i broke his heart. I informed my husband from very first day my FIL did that, but he alqays asked me to keep quiet as his mom woulsnot like. And now my MIL is blaming that m putting false allegations on FIL. In all these my husband has joined in laws in blame game and is not supporting me. His brother supports his wife a lot. MIL and bhabhi support each other. My husband is not at all supporting me. He dosent want to say about his bhabhi and father and just blames me along qith his family. Now i am living separately but he doesnot care. He tells the world that he wanta to keep relation but i dont want. And he tells i want to separate him from his family. But never tells what his family did with me. Should i divorce him? I am in a mess. Emotionally i feel weak.
