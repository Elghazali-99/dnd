Good morning or evening or day or night or afternoon ladies and gentlemen and whassup. My name is Hamed Khatiz and I am a sixteen year old student, writer, drummer, adviser and many more from Sydney. My main message however is about the student part. 
 I used to be an early riser, waking up energetic, nearly hypo every morning. I would be jumping and buzzing waiting for everyone else to wake up. Now I am early waker but cannot find the energy to get out of bed. One more hour won't hurt. 
 I would wake naturally at 1:00am and then again at 4:45am and then again at 7:15am when I actually start the day, leaving at 8:30am to 9am and being at least an hour late for school. 
 I got a lecture from my principal about why I was missing so many classes. In six weeks, zero unexplained absenses turned into eight. I am completely missing classes sometimes, arriving at school at 10:00am sometimes when I used to arrive at 7:30 and have to arrive by 8:20. 
 How do you leave this form slump? I am demotivated when it was only last season, I was more awake than most of my teachers. How do you find the motivation to get up and stay awake because I miss walking to school with my friends on the 8:00am train instead of catching the 9:40am full of not so nice people with brown paper bags over alcohol bottles looking to see whether any of my friends are on the platform.
 Someone mentioned a risk of low level Depression. True?
