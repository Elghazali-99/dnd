Hi,
 I've suffered from bouts of depression since childhood.  At the moment I'm going through a lot of life changes and feel like I need to take an anti-depressant for 3 to 6 months to get me through this time.
 I was going to start on Effexor as my doctor says that is the best one, but having looked up the side effects from other users and I'm not too sure.  Also I tried to take it for a couple of days and felt quite strong side effects (although it was probably not long enough to really work out whether it suited me).
 So he has given me Citalopram instead.  I was hoping I could get some advise from people to which one they would recomend?  I know it's different for everyone, but this effexor sounds like harsh withdrawal symtoms.  I was on fluxotine (I think it was called ) for a year five yeats ago, and it worked and I'm glad I took it during that period of my life as I needed something, i tapered off the drug and got no withdrawal symptoms.  My doctor does not prescribe this one any more as he says the amphetamine-like side effects are too strong.
 I'm not very motivated at the moment and feel like I've kind of got a sedated mood anyway, so I was hoping that Citalopram wouldn't make me feel even more sleepy as I might not get out of bed! Also I'm scared of getting fat, I know this is stupid...but there you go.  Also I have been suffering from insomnia for about a year and a half, but I'm not working at the moment and I don't get insomnia.
 Would be very greatful for any advise.
 Thanks so much.
