as of this last week I feel like my life is falling apart....I am a mother of 2 teenagers...18 and 15 both girls....I have been with the same man for the last 20 years...I have no interest in sex at all anymore...I am very emotional..I can lose my temper or patience at the drop of the hat...I ask to have some help...and I get none...I feel like I don't want to be a mother or a wife...the other day my girls one was sick the other was okay...they had a fight over the front seat of the car ...and I lost it...I started screaming after they were fighting about who was going to sit in the front seat...OMG...I feel like I lose it for no reason...I do not have any energy  and I am very tired one day or two and then I get these energy spirts and want to get things done..and I can stay up half the night ...I think I need some mood swing help!!  At times I even feel like the little things I turn into big things...I get very bothered by little things like people chewing with their mouths open...or small noises like the clicking of the end of the pen...I am an emotional mess....when these things happen my blood boils and I think I would far rather be by myself then have my family live with this messed up person! Please help
