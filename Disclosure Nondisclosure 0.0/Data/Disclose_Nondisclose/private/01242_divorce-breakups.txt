My husband wants to leave me because I abandoned our 1 yr. old puppy.  What I did was horrible and regret it deeply.  We had the puppy for 10 months and for the past 4 months I've been telling my husband that I couldn't handle taking care of a puppy, working 50+ hours a week, taking care of the household, starting my own business and taking care of our 14 month old child.  I would come home and the house would be torn to bits.  I felt like a prisoner in my own home.  I told him on several occasions if we could find a new home for the puppy and/or give it to the shelter.  I pleaded with him time and time again, I even told him I had thoughts of taking the puppy and abandoning it.  He said we were never going to get rid of the puppy and I just needed to deal with it.  My husband also works 50+ hrs a week and the truth is we did not have the time to properly train and care for the puppy.  I envisioned giving the puppy away to a family who had the time to care for him like he should be.  After I told my husband what I had done he said that was it, our marriage was over.  He said what I did was unforgivable and I'm a monster.  I've battled with severe depression on and off through the years and I didn't exactly have a normal childhood, could that have contributed to my erroneous action of abandoning my puppy?  I just want to save my marriage and need help figuring out how.
