My Family does not accept my Bipolar diagnosis at all. By family I mean my mother,father and so on. So, therefore when I do have to be around them I am cut no slack what so ever. I walk on egg shells and do my very best to behave the so called  norm. I am on meds, different ones for 12 years now. My mind races, running in circles, running into brick walls like a childs remote contol car that has no where to go and cannot escape. When I return home to my husband, we live a couple hundred miles away, thankfully, I cannot deal with him at all. No matter what he says or does, I can't stand him. We fight. I don't want him to touch me, hug me, kiss me, nothing at all. Every word out of his mouth is poision. I hate him. But, I know I don't really, but I do. I am fighting myself in my head. Fighting myself everyday, constantly. I have an appt. to see a new therapist, oh joy. When will it ever end? Why do I do this to him? He is going to leave me one day and more than likely take my children. Other than the way I have a perfectly organized home. It is very clean, my oldest child makes perfect grades and is in all advanced placement classes and has tested in the top 2% in the state in science and math. My youngest just turned three and can already count to 25, knows the entire alphabet by sight, my get my point here. I try so hard to do all things perfect and I am not achieving anything. I still want death and the real me is inside fighting this evil ***** who has stolen my body and done secretive evil things that no one else knows about. I want out. What do I do? 
Wow, I didn't expect all of that to come out.
