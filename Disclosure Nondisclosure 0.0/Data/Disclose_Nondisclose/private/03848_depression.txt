In 2005, I had a short bout of ocd and depression and was sent to hospital. However, I have no memory of the period. Recently, I learnt that I was subjected to 6 sessions of bilateral ECT when I was warded. 
 Critics of such treatments highlight the complications of electric-shock therapy, alerting the dangers of cognitive and memory impairement characteristic of a brain damage. 
 In 2009, I was assaulted by a robber (hit several times in the head by a weapon) and suffered head injuries. I fear that compounded with the negative effects of ECT as well as my head injuries in 2009, my brain could be permanently affected. 
 I was reading some old blog entries of mine and realised the memory issues seem to have persisted for years as I was unable to remember events and people which I mentioned in the blog now. I learnt that I had difficulty performing tasks I used to be able to do so effortlessly, e.g. language, art, creative pursuits, etc. I have problems in concentration and attention as well. When I returned to school shortly after the hospitalisation, I was unable to learn and retain information as easily and performed badly in my papers and in dance.
 Physically, I suffered from spontaneous seizures when I was unable to recognise people after coming to, persistent nausea, hand and body tremors. However, I am not sure how much of these effects can be attributed to ect or the medication that I was consuming during the period.
 1. Are the symptoms above indicative of permanent brain damage?
 2. Is the brain damage reversible? If so, how do I know for sure whether my brain has reverted to its former state? 
 3. Should I seek legal recourse? Is the doctor negligent if such treatments was used as a first-line and my consent was not provided? However, consent from my parents was probably given. I was 19 years old back then.
 I wake up in fear and dread everyday. Please help me.
