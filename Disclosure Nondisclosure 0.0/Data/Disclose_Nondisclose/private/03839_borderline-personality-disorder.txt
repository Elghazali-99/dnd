at a loss for what to do...my wife loses her memory several times a month.  In the past, she reverted back to the days when she is a teenager or even early twenties.  She gets splitting headaches, feels exhausted, goes to sleep and wakes up a different person.  not a separate personality but just a different age in her life each time.  Recently, she woke up replacing all of the painful memories (and there are a lot of them) in her life with happy ones.  I was told by her physician to talk her through the painful memories until she can handle them.  After doing this several times, she gets splitting headaches...falls asleep...then comes back forgetting all the painful memories again.  Not sure at all what to do...three doctors and no solid answers...one just wanted her far too heavily medicated.  Another said that one day she would forget everything.  The recent memory losses had all painful memories replaced and I was happy to live with this (the memories she dropped are excruciating (and I mean excruciating) to say the very least...i love her.. and would rather live with the memory loss than see her in so much pain and at the same time she deserves to know the truth and be fully present...many times when she wakes up, she becomes aware that she lost a day or so).  Problem is with the recent memory loses is that she faints sometimes...almost like the memories are flooding back too fast and she physically cant handle it.  I try to help her with the memories...she is aware that things are very foggy and not real like...she believes me and then the headaches...and then the painful memories are gone again.
she is truly an amazing women...an extraordinary survivor...and i am at a complete loss of what to do for her...
