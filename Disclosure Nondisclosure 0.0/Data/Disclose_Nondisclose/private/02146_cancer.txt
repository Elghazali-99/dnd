A few days ago, I went to rest my chin on my hand, and I noticed a vague bruise-like pain just under my chin.  When I touched just under my chin, seemingly attached to the right side of the chin bone, just to the right of that center line where the two sides of the lower jaw meet, I felt a very hard, immobile bump.  It will not budge---I've pressed on it with all my might from each side and from straight up; it's hard as bone, but I cannot tell if it's definitely attached to the jaw/chin. I can feel a bit of space between it and the right jaw bone, but it's harder to feel the top where it meets the tip of my chin.  My chin does not appear swollen at all.  It's still tender to touch, it hurts a bit without even pressing on it now, but I feel that could be due to how much I've been applying pressure.  Otherwise, it doesn't really hurt as a swollen gland would, and it won't move.  It seems to be a bit ovular in shape, protruding out from the tip of my chin, back into the hollow space between the jaw bones.  What could this be?  I'm a 25-year-old female and healthy.
