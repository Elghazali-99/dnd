Hi  my son's father does not want to be involve in his life.  My son is 5 weeks old.  I just contacted my ex a couple weeks ago and told him that it is a great chance that he is the father to my son.  I took my son to see him and he admitted that my son looks just like him (HE REALLY DOES).  He never return any of my messages since then.  This hurts me a lot because he just had a baby girl with another woman (THAT HE IS NOT WITH EITHER) and he is involve in her life.  He has a total of  5 children by 5 different women, including myself.   Two of them are girls, both he is involved with, I am not sure about the other two boys.  
  Why is this?  Has anyone had a similar experience?  Why is he involved with his baby girl but not my son?   When we were together, we had a good relationship.  When I contacted recently him, he was happy to hear from me.  This hurts me because this other baby gets to have a father but my son doesn't.  In the past days, I've sent him mean messages because I am hurt.  How do I raise a boy without a male role model?
