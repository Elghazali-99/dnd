I'm in college, but it always seems impossible and can barely make it through. I'm no lazy butt, my problem is…I have never been a good test taker or even a good writer. It's like test and essays are the only things that count, which stinks. I haven't been doing good with school because of it…and literally ALL confidence is down the drain. In HS, I used to get A and B's now I'm nearly failing. Sometimes I feel as though I'm never good enough, even resulting in not knowing what to pursue in life. Every time I think of a goal, I'm just discourage 'cause I believe I can never achieve it. I've always had an interest in 'medical' things such as, radiology. (Possibly a new major) But, I know deep down becoming a Radiologist is completely impossible for me. I'm not smart enough, I know…and why should I even try. I was thinking about taking a semester off, just to figure things out. Mostly about 'me' before even going back to school, but it's holding me completely back. I cry everyday, knowing I'll never succeed (lol I'm tearing right now). Getting a job as well to help my grandmother out, 'cause she needs help with the bills. Good or bad idea? PLEASE HELP…I feel useless, suicidal…unfortunately.
