Hello everyone,
I'm looking for help and hope!  I have been on lexapro and saphris for about 9 months, and was on paxil for about a year before that.  I have always had insomnia with ssri's so that is why I take the Saphris....usually a 1/4 of a 5 mg tablet would put me to sleep within a 1/2 hour or so.  I recently slowly weaned off lexapro over the last month, but when I got down to nothing I started having horrible insomnia (even with the Saphris).  Sometimes I get to sleep only to wake up a few hours later and then I'm up for the rest of the night.  I'm exhausted!  I feel fine otherwise...no return of anxiety or depression (except centered around sleep which I think is normal given the situation that has been going on for a few weeks.  Does anyne have any input on how long this insomnia will last?  I really want to stay off antidepressants so that my husband and I can try to conceive, but I can't function without sleep!  Can anyone give me any help or ideas?  BTW....I have used klonopin to sleep on occasion, but don't want to take regularly.  I've tried benydryl, unisom, melatonin, tryptophan, GABA....none of the natural stuff seems to work!
