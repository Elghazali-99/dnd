I am looking for anyone who may have been through a similar experience to me.  I met my husband in 2006 and he was living in a hostel, i later found out from staff at the hostel that he was diagnosed as suffering from Paranoid Schizophrenia.  I stayed in the relationship and we had a daughter in May 2008 and moved in together.  He then had a bit of a breakdown and took a knife outside our address as he beleived that someone was outside spying on our house through the letterbox and i was 6 months pregnant at the time with our second daughter.  The Social Services became heavily involved after our second daughter was born in September 2009.  We then had a row in November 2009 and a neighbour called the police and he had to leave then as Socail Services said he was posing too much risk of harm to our daughters.  Our daughters are now in foster care largely due to my husband having Paranoid Schizophrenia and they said i was neglectful as i allowed him to stay in the home with the kids and i put the kids at risk ny having a relationship with him.  They are going to be adopted in the future and i won't see them again until they are 18.  They are now 2 and 3 yeard old.  I am intending to divorce my husband in the near future and am now concentrating on keeping my life in order.  Feel free to email me if you so wish.
 Kind Regards 
Abby
