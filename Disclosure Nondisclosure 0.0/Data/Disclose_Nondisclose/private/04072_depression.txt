I may have depression.
How can I tell? Where do I go from here...?
 I'm a fourteen year old girl and I think I may have depression. I've taken many quizzes online and they all say I have or am likely to have depression, but how do I know if they're really acurate? 
 Lately I've been feeling tired, too tired. Most nights I don't get much sleep, but when I do, I still wake up exausted. I go through the whole day drained. Not only that, but I feel tired of my life in general. I often feel like the whole week just kind of drags on and blends together. I'm always just waiting for the school week to end, but why is that? I have so many caring friends. I love them all so much, but sometimes I just wanna be isolated. I don't feel like talking to people much anymore. I still do though, and it sometimes feels like I have to mask my emotions and fake a smile.  My grades used to be A's and some B's, but now there dropping. I can't concentrate on homework and barely manage to get it done. (If I get it done.) I was never really able to make descions, so I guess that doesn't really matter. I've had suicidal thoughts, but I know that's not the answer. I've just kinda thought about it, no more than that. I can't really talk to my parents about it, I have tried once. They just said to stay positive about life. I can't seem to do that though. I wanna get to a better place of mind, it just doesn't seem likely. I worry and over think everything. Please tell me where to go from here...
