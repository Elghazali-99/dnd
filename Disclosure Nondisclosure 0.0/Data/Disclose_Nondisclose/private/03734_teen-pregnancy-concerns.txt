Hi, okay so I am very very worried...I've been in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend for over a year now, and im very worried she might be pregnant. I am 16 and she is 15
 This is really hard for me and her because I live 1100 miles away. While I was staying at her house for a week, 3 or 4 weeks ago, we touched several times. I did ejaculate and fingered her after washing my hands carefully in hot water and soap. I think there was one time during that week, where I accidently touched her with the hand I had touched my thingy with. 
 Its been around 3 and a half weeks now....and she has missed her period. She was supposed to have her period last week but she didnt, along with that she has really bad cramping, feeling very sick sometimes and being super tired. I told her to go see a doctor to have a test last week, though I really didnt think she could be pregnant. The test showed Negative and it was a huge relief as this would ruin our lives and our parents would kill us. 
 Now one week later, she has very bad cramping in her lower tummy and the only thing I can do is worry. What the doctors said was it is not 100%....I told her to get a new test which she will do tomorrow. I am really freaking out and I dont want to be a bad boyfriend and make her more worried by telling her how freaked out I am. 
 Anyone has any ideas? If she was pregnant....How the heck should we tell our parents...? I havn't even met her dad yet! ( He is super protective) If she is pregnant, she will keep it, and I hope it all will work out anyways. 
 Thanks!
