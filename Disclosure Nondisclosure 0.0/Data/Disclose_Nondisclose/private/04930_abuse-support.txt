Our daughter who is now 24 was raped when she was 12. Since that time she has abused various drugs and repeatedly involved herself with abusive men. Over the years we have had her in counseling and various treatment programs. She always goes back to the same behavior. Now she is living with a man who abuses her mentally and physically. He uses meth which was once her drug of choice. She is currently in a methadone treatment program for oxycontin addiction and having to go every day for her dose. We have offered our love and support throughout it all. She will not admit to us that she's being abused, but yesterday we found out from a very reliable source, the only friend she still has, that this man has strangled her to the point of passing out, sometimes more than once in one day. My husband & I are so consumed with worry. We have gone to the police and called social services but no one can do anything unless she calls or the abuse is witnessed. The biggest clincher now is that not only is our daughter in danger, she also has a beautiful 3 yr old daughter in that house. We have talked with an intervention team in the past but never gone thru with it as I truly don't believe she will agree to go to treatment. We believe she needs a safe inpatient treatment program to get off all drugs and to sort out her mental issues dealing with the rape and her total lack of self-esteem. How do we get her this help if she won't admit to needing it??
