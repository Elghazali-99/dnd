I'm 13 years old, and I've always been a relatively popular, happy girl. I do great in school, play sports, and do a lot of things out of school too. But this year, my parents have started fighting a bit, and ever since, I've been very unhappy. I always think that life seems bleak and that I am a worthless person, and I'm always putting myself down and thinking how ugly I am. It's way worse than normal hormones. I cry all the time and have been yelling and snapping at my friends and family a lot more than normal lately. I just haven't been acting like myself! I either sleep too much or too little, and I never want to wake up.  I've gained ten pounds since the beginning of this school year! I just don't know what to do, I'm so stressed and sad all the time. My mom has severe depression, so it runs in our family. I also started cutting myself in August. I know I shouldn't, and I had stopped for about a month but I got really upset and started again... I've been trying not to, but it's difficult. I know I need help, I just don't know how I could possibly tell anyone. Please help me. Thanks in advance.
