I've always been an emotional kid. Now I'm 18 and still dealing with depression. I lost my longterm boyfriend of two years, and shortly after my grandmother passed away from cancer. Ive dealt with my pain in the past by cutting, bulemia, and anorexia. This time I turned to friends which at first was a good choice. But then I started to make horrible decision and wound up drunk at a 20 year old guys apartment that I didn't know. 
I was really drunk and we ended up having sex. At first with a condom and then later took it off. I'm not the type of girl to hook up with random guys. I felt ashamed and disgusted with myself. 
Now not only am I dealing with the grief and loss of losing my grandmother, ending things with my ex, but now Im extremely worried about possible stds. 
It seems I can never make the right choice and my life is quickly falling apart one bad thing at a time. 
If I find out I have an STD I don't think I will ever forgive myself. I will literally hate myself for making such a stupid decision. I'm so afraid to get tested because if anything comes out positive I have a strong feeling I will fall so deep into depression I will never get out of this mess. 
I don't want to kill myself, but I'm finding it hard to be happpy. I know I could never do that to myself. I just wish i could go back in time. 
I'm praying for a miracle.
