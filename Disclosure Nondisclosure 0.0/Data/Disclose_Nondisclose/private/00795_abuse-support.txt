I am with someone who is destroying me completely.  He is a very overpowering man and has within the 1 year of us being together totally taken control over me.  He swears at me for anything little thing i do i.e accidently putting butter on his toast or not giving him the right towel, he tells me that i am a sla* and whor* and that no one would ever have me because of the realtionships i have had in the past and that i am stupid, he is always using his strength to take control of the argument and by this i mean grabbing me by the throat or holding me up against the wall, but he says he is not silly to mark my face as he wouldnt want others to know.  I want to lieave him desperately but he hasnt threatned to hurt my mum and grandmother who live alone if i do because they kept things about me from him (rightly so) in the past.  I tried to run away last year and he smashed there house windows and threatned my mum but police did nothing as there was no evidence, he is too clever for that.  I hate being with him and scared of everything i do incase its going to upset him.  He doesnt allow me to go out or to socialise anymore or even to have a drink at home now i am being classed as a alcoholic, (i hardly drink).  I have contemplated suicide because of the pain i go through, waking up in the morning and being sworn at so much becuase of something minor and having to wipe my tears and go to work with a brave face.  I stay with him because of the fear of what my poor parents will have to go through if I leave and i dont think its fair as they dont deserve this.  I just really wanted some one to talk to.
