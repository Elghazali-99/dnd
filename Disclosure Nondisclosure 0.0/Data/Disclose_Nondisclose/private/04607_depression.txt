At the beginning of this year I was hospitalized for depression. Right before that I got married. I can honestly say I'm in a verbally and emotionally abusive marriage. I left a few times, but I keep going back and I don't know why. He has so many insecurities and takes them out on me. He calls me a prostitute,  b@%!, cu%# because i had boyfriends before I got married. Whenever he loses it with me he blames me for the nasty things he says because i don't obey him and i stick up for myself. But all these months have worn me down. I feel like i cant go on. He is easily ready to walk away and blame me for my failures because im 35 and havent finished college yet or had kids. He has a way of twisting everything to avoid blame and make me out to look like the bad one. Please someone tellme how to get through this.  Every day I wake up and think why am I still alive? How can a worthless person like me go on. Even my own mother treats me like crap and has done so all my life. They have both said i should just die. Maybe they are right.
