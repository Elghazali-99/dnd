Mom mom, suffers from paranoia in a very severe way.  She had a nervous break down in 1984 and had to be hosptalized and heavily drugged.  I just found this out shortly before my dad died last year.  He suffered alot because she was always accusing him of infidelity.  She has been fearful for years, e.g. someone was out to do me harm keep my visits short etc.  Then she started to believe people were breaking into her house.  Almost daily something is missing and she claims someone broke in and took her socks, shoes, underwear, glasses etc. sometimes it is valuable stuff but most times mundane things no one would take and pawn as she claims in a million years.  She has alienated many of her friends over the years by accusing them or their offspring of taking two plates for example.  She maintains my adopted brother breaks in stealthily and steals.  Now it is my turn. Tonight she came and asked for her house keys back after mentioning that some of her stuff was missing and I had been in her house alone.  I have been in her house alone many times at her insistance so that she can run errands because she is afraid if she is gone for ten minutes immediately someone will break in her house.  She is convinced her phone is tapped and her house bugged.  She locks everything up multiple times.  How can we help her return to a normal life?  She thinks there is a major conspiracy to prove her crazy.  She also senses others would perceive her that way that is why she does not call the police and in fact is fearful of them and thinks they are breaking in and monitoring her.  What can we do? She refuses to seek her on her own.  Also how can I deal or cope with this?
