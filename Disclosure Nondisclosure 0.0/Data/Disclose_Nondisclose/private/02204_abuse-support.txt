I have been reading alot about the "sub" basically taking over anf people becoming addicted--today is 9/27/09 as I write this--i was prescribed 3 8mg a day by my pompous *** doc--who thinks he knows everything--and will refute anything i have to say on the subject --even the contraindications on the damn brochure!!!! .......anyway 3 a day was making me all jittery ,weird and massive headaches--as of this writing i have been off the "bluebirds" (30mg roxys) for 12 days..i feel great going for a bike ride here at 8am on a sunday--have lost some weight have a clear head--i am currently at between 4-8 mg a day i have quicklt tapered down going from 3 a day to 2 in just 2 days now I am down to 1 or less and will cut that in half tomorrow--need some feed back when i make the final "jump" from just 2mg to nothing what should i expect?...or should i go 1 day at 2mg and skip a day etc an even slower detox --need some real life advice from people --nor pill pushing doctors--you know this jerk actually writes roxys for "pain management " too!! gets you hooked and gets your $ ...then gets you"detoxed" and gets your$....that's like a ben and jerry's in the front of the store and weight watchers in the back STUPID!!!!!...anyway could use some feed back --feel like i have my life back though getting interedted in things again and exercising etc...just want to make sure i don't fall into tthis addiction trap with these things....sorry to say this but if that is the case --i would rather take the blues ya know--thanx---
