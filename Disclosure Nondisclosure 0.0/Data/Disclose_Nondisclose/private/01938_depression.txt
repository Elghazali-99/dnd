I'm a 17 year old, small town girl who dreams of making it big - in medicine. I have suffered from depression, anxiety, and ICD for 4 heard now. I'm a senior in high school and just feel very alone. My friends are all getting boyfriends or hooking up, and I feel left out majority of the time. My "friends'" prom dates even got my date to dump me and kicked me out of their group this spring four days after my nearly fatal car accident. Whenever I ask to wear who I consider a good guy friend's jersey, they come up with an excuse. It makes me feel worthless. On the other hand, I have several graduated guy friends who constantly try to push me to have sex with them. Every time I chicken out. I want to do it, but I am scared absolutely ********. That's when the name calling starts. "*****" "prude" "tease" I just feel absolutely worthless. I haven't cut myself in a while, but suicide is always on my mind. I've never had the guts to do it - I have three younger sisters who I don't want to hurt. What the hell am I supposed to do?
