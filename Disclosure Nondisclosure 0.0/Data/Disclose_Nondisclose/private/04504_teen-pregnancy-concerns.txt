Please help me. I'm 18 years old and my last period was like the end of July probably the 31 but I know I had it for August 3. Since then I move to college two weeks ago and haven't had my period this month. I have always been regular and had one every month. So I should've have one by at least between the 24-29. On top of being late, the 29th if this month me and my bf was making out and it got a little out of hand. He had pulled himself out and rubbed my outside for less than 5 seconds then got a condom but I was frighhten and didn't want sex. He tried going in but I kept moving as he tried bc I couldn't say anything from being so scared. And being a virgin it hurt and he barely got pass the hole if he even got in at all. But I want to know could just by that I could be pregnant and with me already late (maybe) from moving to college right before the time of my next period and what happened with my bf? What is the chance? Oh idk if he had pre-*** bc he kept rubbing on me like he was trying to get me more wet or he wasnt and when he had the condom on.
