My husband has been verbally abusive with horrible anger outbursts for a long time, worse in recent years. He suffers from depression, and at times I really wonder if his mental issues are even deeper. A few weeks ago, we finally had the "big one" where I became frightened for my safety, and I had finally had enough. I had reached the point of second-guessing myself, my self-esteem was barely existent, I was afraid to make decisions, and I was tired of walking on eggshells around him and having every breathing moment worrying about if I was going to do something that would make him mad. 
I began going to counseling and am rebuilding my assertiveness and self-esteem. I have come to realize that I'm living my life as a battered spouse and I have reached the point of deciding whether I should stay or go. I have been with this man for 24 years, and we still love each other, but I'm not sure our marriage is going to last much longer as I refuse to continue living like this any more. I have not only myself to think about, but also my 12 year old daughter. I can fix me, but I can't fix him...And I'm not sure he is ever going to see the root of the problem...
