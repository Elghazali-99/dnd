I have got really bad memory, lack of concentration, if i go outside for a walk, my neck is strained, even i can fell my end of tongue is strained, start sweating very much, so even i can feel the leek of sweat is goind down from armpit.
 I am very sensible for other opinions, if i am start strees i can feel my eyes like want to cry, but never cry. This is i am kind of steady, allways talk in the same tone of voice, never cry even i want myself to cry, i yust cant make it. i dont haer what poeple says to me sometimes, i need to ask to repeat what has been said to me.
 i feel all the time taired. always i want sleep. mostly happens to me that i am not alble to sleep, but if i close eyes i fell better.
  as well i feel need sometimes so much to masturbate, sometimes i do it for 3-4 hours. mostly after strees.
 i had depresion for 2 years around, but have never taken doctor adviced medicines. even i dont know am i still sick of depresion or not, but most of the time i feel like sad about my self, espacialy like about my concentration, i am talkless, i dont speak much, sometimes friends ask me what happen why are you said why you dont talk. it yust my had is empty, no minds, no opinions. and its strange, i can be good at logical things at mathematic, while to say something to friend is hard, even sentense, sometime i forgot what i want to say to them after two works of that sentense. 
 i have never done plans for example: what i am going to do today, i yust lack concentration for that( after 2 min thinking i am somewhere else..)
  recently, i think about suicide..
 who knows what is to me, bad metabolism or mental dease or braind with defects..
