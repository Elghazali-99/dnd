I believe Im perimenopausal. I have missed a period last one I missed three periods and at present am two weeks late. I started having trouble after having my fourth child six years ago. I am now 43 and for the last six months have had a host of problems. The palpitations have been the most worrying . I do suffer from anxiety and five years ago palpitaio.s got so bad I went to a&e where I had an abnormal ecg. I was referred by my doc to a cardiologist. I had a holter for a couple of weeks which was good together with an echocardiogram which showed I was good. Just over two months ago I ended up in a&e again for chest pain and palpitations I was kept  a d treated as a heart attack which was horrible. All this because of another abnormal ecg. I was discharged the next day with esophagul spasms. I believe it was the antidepressants I started that gave me the palpitiomz
 Because I gave up smoking 15 months ago and put on four stone on my torso I had to have another 24 hr monitor which I had 6 weeks ago ( no results yet) and next Monday I have to have a myocardial perfusion scan. I am ab solutely terrified. Has anyone had this scan or had the palpitations and had an.abnormal ecg. Sorry for the long post. Xx
