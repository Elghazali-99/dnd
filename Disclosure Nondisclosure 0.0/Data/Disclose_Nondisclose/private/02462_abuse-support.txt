I have been physically and verbally abused by parents all my life and my mums is more morthery and for my own good but my dad is anthor story. So my dad beats me and screams abuse because I do things such as forget to wheel the bins out and he reacts so much because he says he told me so many times and he sick of it, he has depression and I understand that he is stressed because of his job and I don't hate him for it because I have been taught to love my parents and I understand its for my own good, but I can't take it I have no one to talk to about it and I dont want to call the police because my mom loves him and it would tear my family apart and he would have nothing left, and when this happens my mum has to deal with it as well she needs to try calm him down and she can only take so much, he usaully pinches me hard so I get bruises and bleed and hihemp head with his shoe, he used to use a metal pot on my head and at one point he threw a glass bowl at my head and I went to hospital . he just abused me about 20 mins ago when there was some cheese that I leave out for my cat on the floor and he screamed at me and told me to pick it up I went outside for a brief moment and he started screaming at me and asking me what did he tell me what to do and I didn't rember because I've been hit in the head so much that I have short term memerorie loss and it has affected my education as well, I feel sad but Im not going to lie saying I've never been happy because I'm happy but I feel like after the abuse I'm sad but then numb. I just wanted to tell someone and get some advice, I don't want to talk on the phone or anything , he should be getting better cause he quit his job but I don't know what to expect he is seeing a pychologist.the abuse happens at least once a mouth and the verbal nearly every day. Please don't report this to police I don't want my family to be split, I can't comment susicide because that would be selfish of me to do that to my mom and sister when I mention it my sister starts crying I'm 13 right now and she's 15
