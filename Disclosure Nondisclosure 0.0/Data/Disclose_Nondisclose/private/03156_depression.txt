My fianc√© recently broke off our relationship she suffers from depression and in November had work issues and was signed off then returned part time. She pursued me for months and also was the one who proposed, the doctor prescribed more anti depressants and she suddenly said we did not need to get married we were fine as were, then, she said that she wanted me to move out I knew she did not like living with people so I did and then she said she no longer loved me and we were not right for each other I feel like the meds/illness have caused this but she has said that she is so happy without me and shown no sadness at the demise of our relationship but I know from mutual friends that she is not really happy but she shuts people out of her life very easily should I give up and stop trying to be supportive or keep going and hope she comes round I know this sounds like a typical break up but our relationship was great until the depression started up any advice would be great as I am stressed out and miserable thanks
