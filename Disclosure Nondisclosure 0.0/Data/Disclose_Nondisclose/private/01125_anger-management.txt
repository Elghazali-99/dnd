I have been with this man since his 2 boys were 3 and 5.  First we were friends and he was having a hard time.  I gave the boys and him beautiful Christmas's every year and I cooked and cleaned for him.  We were friends, worked at same place and I was happy to help.  I even babysit while he went on dates.  Well, times where tough and we moved in together to save money, fell in love.  I've been through 2 cancers with him and he was right by my side on both.  I now am on social security.  My problem is he is putting his drug using son in front of me all the time.  He always trys to be his friend and not a parent.  He yells at me all the time and right in front of his son.  Yesterday he said he was going to start being a parent and not give him money for weed or phone bills.  Yes this boy is going to be 20 this month.  This morning asap I got outta bed he said he needed a cigarette for his son (his mother locked the door on him, so he spent the night with us) and he would pay for one.  I kinda rolled my eyes, not because he asked, because of the comment he would pay for one.  Then it started, he had enough of me, f this and f that.  I was walking toward him to get my coat cause I had to run and pay bills and he yelled again, f this and f that.  This has been going on for 3 years now.  I can't leave, I have no place to go and besides he's a really good man when this son isn't around.  I pay the mortage with my ss, he pays the electric and buys food and the rest goes to his son, he finally admitted it.  If just once he would yell at his son the way he yells at me????
