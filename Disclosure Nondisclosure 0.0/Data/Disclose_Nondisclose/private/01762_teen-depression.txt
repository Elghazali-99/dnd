My daughter was recently hospitalized for bipolar disorder.  She was prescribed Topmax and some new to us called Geodon?  She said she felt the best on this then anything else she's ever been on.  We went to pick up a prescription at the walmart after she was released and they want $500.00 a month.  Turns out her dad dropped her off his insurance.  Until I get that situation resolved.  I am wondering if there is anything less costly I can get for her that we would get the same results with or if anyone knows of any programs to help us, perhaps through the manufacturer, to get us by.  She really does need this, without it she's mean as a rattlesnake and does very poorly in school.  She was really hysterical when she found out we couldn't get them.  She really wants to feel good inside.  I make too much to qualify for Medicaid benefits and I'm trying to get help through the county, but not sure if I'll qualify.  I'm looking for other ways to get these meds for her.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
