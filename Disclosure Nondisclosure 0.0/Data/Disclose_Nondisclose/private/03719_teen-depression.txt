im 16 and for the past few months i have been really down. Everything that has ever happened to me i don't really let it affect me as i feel i need to be strong and if im not it makes me seem weak.
Everybody thinks that im just a miserable teenager who doesnt have real problem but deep down i do. i see myself as a very deep person who thinks about things in great detail and sometimes even to much. about a year ago i was really depressed just because i had no confidence and i hated myself and a few months later my mum had a heart attack which to a point i blame myself because when it happened she didnt know what it was but she told me to go out and i did and then while she was in hospital for a month i was at home living on my own with no one to talk to.
 after my mums recovery about 5 months ago someone i know did something to me i didnt want to happen but still to this day i cant come to terms and believe what actually happened and again i blame myself... after meeting my boyfriend he has made me such a happier person but still deep down inside when i have bad days i always think about what has happened in the past and blame myself and me being down does last for a while.... i need help ... is this normal?
 sorry for going on, i would appreciate some advice if you have any, thank you.
