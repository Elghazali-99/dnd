I have been addicted to cutting for about 5 years now. I finally quit about 5 months ago but I am SO stressed out and so severely depressed lately that I relapsed tonight... I don't think I've ever been this depressed before. A year ago when I was hospitalized and thought I hit rock bottom people told me that "it will get better," "this too shall pass," and "it can only go up from here." But obviously it just continues to go downhill. I'm not sure in every situation that there is a rock bottom. I think sometimes you can just keep going down, because when it rains it pours, and things could always be worse. I cut because I don't have anyone to turn to. My family doesn't understand, and my boyfriend, the father of my unborn child and the only friend I have left, is not really there for me anymore... Idk what to do. Calling a hotline doesn't really work for me and I'm trying to get back into counseling, but all they really do is watch the clock the whole hour and even if I'm crying at the end of the hour they very abruptly change the subject and it just pisses me off. I realize that they have other clients but that is why it doesn't do much for me. I hate taking meds because they either make me more depressed, or they make me feel like a zombie. And besides I'm pregnant now, and I see all those commercials all the time about how anti depressants have affected babies and their health or made them develop some abnormality. Idk what to do anymore..
