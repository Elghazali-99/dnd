Ever since I had my son 4 months ago, I've just felt very depleted of energy, like I don't want to do anything at all, and physically can't do anything. I'm tired all the time, which with a baby I can understand, but my mother's watching him for awhile and even though he's not here, I can't relax enough to sleep well. I'm jumpy and I can sleep 7 hours and I'm still tired all the time. I'm stressed because my boyfriend's laid off from work because of the flood issue, I'm trying hard to get a job, work at home, so there's money and I can still be here with my son. 
When I was pregnant with him I hardly had migraines, but I had very bad back pain, especially in the ciadic nerve area which I still get at times. 
I'm tired of everything being about work and money, and I was hoping to be able to relax and I'm trying to get some of this stuff looked at, but it's going to take two weeks on the blood work, and I've taken some energy drinks and they don't even pep me up. There's just constant pain and pressure and stress. I'm a person that comes from a high blood pressure, highly stressful family, but doctors I go to really don't seem to care. 
Plus it doesn't help that after I had my son, I've had severe post-partum depression but I have no idea what to do. I was in a lot of pain after I had him, but because he was a two month premie, the doctors and nurses wanted me there all the time because they thought I wasn't bonding with him, so I was there everyday for about 10 days, then coming home with him and getting up all the time to feed him, and the migraines have come back and if anyone has them, they know what a screaming baby does to migraines.So yeah, I would say there's some stress there.
