Hi,
 We're pleased to announce the Mood Tracker, the tenth in a series of Personal Health Applications (PHAs) geared towards helping our members keep track of their health metrics, symptoms, treatments, test results and events.
 With this tracker, you can track your daily mood changes and keep a journal of how you're feeling each day. All you have to do is indicate if you're feeling excellent, good, okay, bad, or horrible.
 For MedHelp members looking for more advanced tracking, you can track symptoms associated with the various mood disorders as defined by the DSM-IV, including major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. You can also track any medications or treatments you're taking.
 All members can view their friend's public mood trackers and leave them a note if they're feeling down.
 You can access the Mood Tracker by clicking on the "Trackers" link at the top of the community or from My MedHelp.
 We plan on adding more functionality to the Mood Tracker over the next few weeks and would love to get your suggestions and feedback. If you want to track a specific treatment or event, let us know. Please post your comments in the MedHelp Suggestions community, accessible via My Shortcuts.
 Best,
MedHelp
