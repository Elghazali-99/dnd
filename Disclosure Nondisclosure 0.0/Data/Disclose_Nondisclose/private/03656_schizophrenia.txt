I'M A 46 YR. OLD MALE DIAGNOSED SCHIZO-EFFECTIVE BI-POLAR. FRIDAY MORNING TO LATE FRIDAY NIGHT/REAL EARLY SATURDAY MORNING 11/14-15/14  I'D TAKEN MY MEDS 2 DAYS IN 1 DAY. I CALLED MY MOM WHO IS A NURSE. SHE SAID NOT TO TAKE ANY MEDS ON SATURDAY TO GIVE IT TIME TO WORK OUT OF MY SYSTEM. ON SUNDAY 11/16/14 I STILL FELT WEIRD SO I DIDN'T TAKE MY MORNING OR AFTERNOON MEDS EITHER. A DEPARTMENT OF CHILDRENS AND FAMILY (DCF) WORKER CAME BY EARLY AFTERNOON. I WASN'T FEELING GOOD THEN EITHER SO SHE CALLED AN AMBULANCE. THEY TOOK MY TO THE HOSPITAL WHEN THEY CAME OUT. THE ER DOCTOR WANTED TO TRANSFER ME TO A TAMPA CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT (CSU) UNDER THE BAKER ACT (INVOLUNTARILY ADMISSION) FOR ADMISSION. AFTER TALKING TO THE PSYCHIATRIC NURSE SHE MANAGED TO GET THE BAKER ACT RESCINDED. I WAS HAVING SOME PROBLEMS WITH HEARING VOICES AND SEEING THINGS THAT WEREN'T THERE ALONG WITH A BAD DEPRESSION. I'D BEEN HAVING ALOT OF MEMORY LOSSES AND CONFUSION GOING ON. THEY DIAGNOSED ME WITH PSYCHOSIS. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY PSYCHIATRIST ON WEDNESDAY 11/26/14 BECAUSE MY SYMPTOMS ARE ONGOING. I TAKE GEODONE 80 MG. TWICE A DAY. I ALSO TAKE BUSPAR 15MG. TWICE DAILY, BENZTROPINE 2MG. TWICE DAILY, PAXIL 20MG. ONCE DAILY, PERPHENAZINE 4MG. TWICE DAILY, AND DEPAKOTE 500MG. ONCE DAILY. COULD I'VE GROWN IMMUNE TO MY MEDS? THEY'VE HELPED SOME BEFORE BUT NOT COMPLETELY ELIMINATING THE VOICES OR SEEING THINGS. THE DEPRESSION SEEMS TO GOTTEN WORSE. I'D SAY THE DEPRESSION WAS GETTING INTO A SEVERE STAGE. COULD THE PSYCHOSIS BE SEVERE NOW? I APPRECIATE THE ADVICE AND HELP FROM ANYONE. DOES ANYONE KNOW OF OTHER DRUGS THAT MIGHT WORK BETTER THAT I CAN ASK MY PSYCHIATRIST ABOUT? I'M DISABLED ON DISABILITY. I'VE BEEN SICK AND LOST 35LBS AS WELL DURING THIS TIME.
