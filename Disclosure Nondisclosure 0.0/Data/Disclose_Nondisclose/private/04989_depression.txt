I've been feeling down for about 2 years now. It's mostly because I'm afraid of being unloved. I don't know my real father. My mom said the last time I actually saw him is she I was two. Last year I met my family from that side (minus him)  and they said they would stay in touch but they never called me. Not for my birthday, for Christmas. They just pretended we never met again. I feel like I let them down. I'm always losing friends and last year I lost one if my closest friends. We even called each other sisters. We were at each other's houses all the time. She went behind my back and started talking bad about me. We got in a physical fight and both got suspended for two days. Everyone always says that I did the right thing. But idk. My older cousin moved in with us for a few months. It was supposed to be until he found a job and moved away. But he just moved back home. He pretended like he cared about me we even told each other things we wouldn't tell anyone else. Now he barely talks to me. I have a cousin who's about 2 years older than me and he told his parents he's depressed so I'm scared that if I tell mine they will think I just want to copy him and want attention. I was a cutter for about a year and a half. I wore the thick rubber bracelets and pants all the time. I recently choked myself with a cord until I passed out. I wanted to commit but it just didn't happen. Please help.
