This might be some information that is scary to read, but it's the truth i want people as we all do on med help to reach out as much as you can to other people and talk about getting help with any mental illness. It is nothing to be ashamed of. It is something we all know is a very scary situation but in helping each other we can help the world. I would like everyone to read this.
 Compared Mental ILLNESSES OTHER HEALTH ISSUES 
THEY SAY MENTAL ILLNESS IS A WEAKNESS? SO NOT TRUE!
IT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISEASES OUT THERE! 
NOT SOMETHING TO MESS AROUND WITH "30,000 SUICIDES" EACH YEAR WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? THAT'S WHY I REACHED OUT. IT IS A HUGE DEAL . NO ONE WANTS TO BE MENTALLY ILL.
 Facts:
30,000 Americans die by suicide each year; an additional 500,000 Americans attempt suicide annually.
 Nearly 3/4 of borderlines attempt suicide or display self-mutilating behaviors like cutting themselves with razors or burning themselves. Only about 10% of suicide attempts are successful. Symptoms of borderline personality disorder and risks of suicide are greatest during young adulthood .
 Among adolescents, suicide ranks as the third leading cause of death, behind unintentional injury and homicide.
  Despite declines among all age groups nationwide, for adolescents between the ages of 15 and19 the suicide rate has increased by 6 percent, and among children between the ages of 10 and 14, the rate has increased by more than 100 percent.
