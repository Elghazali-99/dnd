I am 15 years old and I have developed a really bad case of depression. Every aspect of my life is against me..
-I only have a few close friends... and even then, they talk about me behind their backs. I can't find new friends because I don't fit in with them (interests and such), and I don't want to change myself to be accepted like that.
-At school i'm awkward with people and literally nobody really takes notice of me/thinks i'm worth the time.
-I've lost my motivation to study and do homework and i'm freaking out because i'm an A-grade student, and the pressure is on.
-I'm really, really stressed.
-I'm also extremely self-conscious and have really low-esteem. So it doesn't help that I am a minority in the place I live, in because I am fully aware of that every time I go out in public. I'm also really shy.
-I've been living in the same place for too long stranded in the middle of nowhere.
-My passions lie elsewhere.... I've ALWAYS dreamed of being 'free'. It feels like I was born to NOT stand around in the same spot for a long time.
-I'm having suicidal thoughts but the chances of committing suicide is very slim, as I have dreams to fulfil which i cannot at the moment.
-My family doesn't understand about it and keep telling me to 'suck it up' (that's not exactly what they said, they said something that affected me just as much).
-My 'love life' is absolutely hopeless... and i'm pretty sure my crush thinks i'm a creep and resents me. And it's tearing me apart...
-I take up a sport but I can't play or practice it at home because our backyard is really small and I don' want to go out  because of my 'fear'.
-I have hobbies... but they don't interest me as much anymore.... in fact, i think i've lost a lot of interest in them.
-All i think about is schooling overseas but i'm too young (15) although, i have family at the place i am thinking about of taking up school there if i EVER get my parents' permission.
-My parents are really strict and we hardly ever do something ( go out, drive around, etc.)
-I don't want to school anywhere else in this country (i'm not racist, i swear), i just want to 'test' myself... because i really believe that if i have no remnants of this life where i go, i'll only have myself to improve on... and then i'll come back here a stronger person...!
-I also can't wait (i need to go as soon as possible) because i just know that any longer, and i fear that my depression/stress/anxiety will get so much worser.
-I can't see a specialist (i'm not like that and my parents won't approve).
-I absolutely DO NOT want to take drugs but only as a last resort.
I really feel that what I need is a change of surroundings, go to a different school... that kind of thing. Although, in a different country.. We're also not poor by the way, we've got quite a bit of money...
I'm not running away, I'm  trying to improve myself because i've still got 3 years of school left.
What do you think? Do you think schooling overseas for under a year, in accordance to my problems/statuses, would help me? Because I really think it would.. 
If you have any other suggestions to help please type them down...
