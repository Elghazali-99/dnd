I've recently started seeing a man who lives with his 18 yr old daughter. They seem more like a married couple than anything else and it's begun to concern me.  Especially when the other night after making love he & I got on the topic of 3soms and he said he'd had one once at the house. For some reason I asked where his daughter was at the time and he said, with a straight face, "she was there too". When my eyes widened and I said "what?!" he paused a bit too long then smiled and said she was gone, out. But there was something about the way he said it that made me believe he was telling me the encounter was with her (and one of her friends?)... That he'd been testing my reaction. Especially since in the past he has answered things in much the same way only to act like it was a joke; but more often than not I find his "joke" answers are the truth - he always admits them later.
He & his daughter are very very close. She acts like his wife. Always calling to see when he'll be home.  It makes me uncomfortable although she doesn't seem to have any problem with our relationship. It's strange. Lately I wonder if I imagine it all or if they are sexual or have been in the past. Something about the way they interact screams "relationship" - although they are careful not to be too physical around me. 
What signs of incest should I be looking for? Is there anything telltail that will confirm my assumptions?  Why would anyone mention their daughter when talking about who a sexual encounter was with? Isn't this odd? I don't want to find problems where there are none but don't want to be in this if it is what I fear. I'm afraid I already love him so even putting this out there is hard & seems like a betrayal. I just don't know if I should trust my instincts or not. Maybe I am paranoid??  Any advice is appreciated.
