i hit my head on a newly painted wooden block which balances my celing in home, i am having a minor head bump in my scalp right in TOP  portion on my head at the edge of frontal lobe near the parietal lobe. 
it is not visible, but one can feel by touching it.it is very narrow block only 7 cms in width,5 cm in height..but it was balancing the celing of huge weight. AFTER THAT BLOW, THERE WAS NO CHANGES IN ME, I WAS ABSOLUTELY NORMAL,THOUGH I WAS RUBBING MY HEAD AFTER THAT PAIN. MAY BE IN WAS INJURY TO SCALP. THAT LASTED FEW DAYS WHENEVER  I TRIED TO COMB MY HAIR.NOW it is over. 
 that was a hard unexpected blow, when i was trying to jump and i got hit by that  wooden block which was very near my head, not a a huge distance. i got hit many times like that before, but itdidn't affect me at all....but that time i think the momentum must be huge, because i hit that block by jumping a larger distance than before. 
 that hapenned 8 months ago.i don't have headache,there is not a blood bleeding in my scalp or any other problem. but can  it result in loss of memory or any other concentration problem?.... i can feel onething clear, i feel a liitle dizzy while getting early for school in morning. but alertness had reduced . i don't feel any pain when i touch that area.i feel difficult to concentrate.i now realize that i was deviating from my habits from then. THE BUMP IN SCALP NOW HAS NOT GONE PERFECTLY AND STILL STAYS., 
  my academic performance has reduced.can it be an internal injury? 
 it might be a scalp injury.i do have troubles in recalling.. i feel restless sometimes,very emotional, i was never like that before.a local doctor told nothing to worry that time. 
these occur rarely. 
PLEASE HELP ME WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW? WILL THAT MINOR BLOW BE A SHOCK IN BRAIN , OR HEAD INJURY LIKE THAT? 
 I AM A 17 YEAR OLD GIRL.
when does one have head injury only when bleeding from scalp occurs? 
whenever u get a hard blow, will it be affecting ur cognitive ability?
