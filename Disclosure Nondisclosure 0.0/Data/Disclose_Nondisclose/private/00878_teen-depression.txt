I'm nearly 18 and I thought I was bi from an early age, I acted on it and experimented with girls and guys, figuring out what gender I was into. Now, after doing all of that, I still don't know and it kills me inside. I'd be happy straight, bi or gay. I just can't figure it out. I 'stopped' being bi when I was about 16 because i truly believed I didn't like guys anymore, there are loads of debates, especially on the internet about what makes you your sexuality. I feel like I need to be with a guy for security and I don't mind kissing or dating, but I would never have sex with a guy again and as for girls, I don't mind if I have sex or not on the whole tbh. I have experimented with many, many males and equal amount with females. This causes me no end of depression and hatred for myself, I have horrible identity crisis's and I will be happy whatever my sexuality is. (My parents and friends didn't mind at all that I was bi). My question is how do I know what my sexuality? Please help
