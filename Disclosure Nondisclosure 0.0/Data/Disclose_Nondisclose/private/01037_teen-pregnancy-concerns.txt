Hi, im a 13 year old boy and my gf and I recently did some bad things. She came over to my house and we touched and i think i may have gotten some pre-*** on my hands before i fingered her... Though she is on birth control pills. She took a test today and her 19 year old sister took it and said it was positive. But didnt show her until around 15 mins later. Then she took one herself and it was negative. She just called me and told me, but i thought it was impossible because we didnt actually to (it) thought she asked me to and i refused. Once again, she is on the pills and had two different answers. First +, second -. Im extremely scared because i play two sports and have my hole life ahead of me. And not prepared for a kid. Im so scared that im hitting my head on walls and lashing out. And im constantly in tears. Im so terrified that i dont know what to do. Please help me Im feeling sick and am once again balling. I dont know what to do. Any help is helpful. maybe abortion possibilities?
 Thanks to anyone who comes to my rescue. Once again, we're both 13 almost 14
