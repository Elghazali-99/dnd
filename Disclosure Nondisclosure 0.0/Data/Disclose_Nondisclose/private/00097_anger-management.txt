My son is 41 and has been clean & sober for eleven years. For the most part he is a happy hard working man who loves his family. However, he has these anger issues where if something is displeasing him sometimes he will "go off" is the only way I can explain it. It is truly his "problem" and people around him are walking on eggshells when this happens until he "gets over it" As his mother I feel bad for Michael and the people around him, I never had an anger issue and his father didn't either. I have talked to him about it and let him know that I feel it is his responsiblity to do something about it. I don't know how to help him. In the latest episode he caught some teens drinking at a party at his house and when Michael lectured the teens about it, got smart mouthed with Michael and he almost put his hands on this 17 yr. old. Would an antidepresant keep him leveled out? Maybe a drug ment for impulse control?
How can I help my son be a better man? He works a 12 step program, but still has this one fault. Help please
