My husband has been an alcoholic for years. Together for 6 yrs and married for almost 4. It took forever, it seemed, but he is now on the longest streak of not drinking. As of late, he has been going in to screaming fits, telling me that i have no emotion, no ambition and am selfish. He has a very high sex drive, as do i on a normal day, but when he yells at me, i lose any sexual interest. He complains about everything, bullies me to get his own way and will then turn around and want to have sex. I told him that i will not deal with his screaming. I have yelled back a few times but for the most part i get quiet and shut down. If i argue back, it blows up even more. I apologize if there is a wrongdoing on my part but lately he is blaming everything on me. And then he says sorry for yelling and expects everything to be fine as if nothing happened. I went thru hell and back while he was still drinking and i know i have changed emotionally since then. My feelings are never taken into consideration and when i become upset about something, he yells because i make him feel bad. I can't figure out for the life of me what I'm doing wrong. Any advice would help
