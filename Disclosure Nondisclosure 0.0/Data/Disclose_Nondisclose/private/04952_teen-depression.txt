It started when I was in 3rd grade. I was really quiet and I always tried to fit in but at the end of the day I would make fake friends. It really affected me as I am very insecure about my friends now. I am 15 and I barley ever talk to anyone. I think I am too attached to my best friend who goes to a different highschool than me and I feel very lost. It is like I need her to be around me to make me function properly. She stopped texting me and I felt very Alone. Although I usually take the courage to text her first she is either busy or she can't talk ATM. I technically gave up. I think it got worse when we finally hanged out but I felt like a loner since she and her other friends were always ahead. Again I tried to join the convo but I lost all my courage. Even though we have been best friends for 6 years I still have big insecurities. I can't concentrate on my homework, my grades are falling. I don't know what I want to do in the future, when I'm at home I crawl into a ball and lie on my bed for several hours until dinner and repeat the process. I lie down thinking about nothing just looking at the white walls. I have no motivations what so ever. I'm constantly thinking about if I have depression. I have cut myself before and it did not phaze me. My paremts doesny understand, heck they make me feel worse, always comparing me to other children saying how smart they are. Please I don't know what to do anymore.
