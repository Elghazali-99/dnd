My fiance started serving weekends in jail yesterday until Monday & he will do that every weekend until he serves 29 days. We recently lost a baby last month & I had surgery the end of June. I've been having problems with my anxiety again also trouble sleeping. I have mood swings & flip out on my fiance for no reason. I just feel like he won't listen unless I make a big deal about it. All we ever talk about is stuff about him. I used to see him everyday & now it's every 2 or 3 days. He has been giving me a lot of space & I feel like he is pushing himself away. We also have a 2 year old son that he hasn't spent time with in over a week. I just want to know what I can do??? I feel left out a lot & sit at my dad's all the time since that is where I am living at the moment. I just feel like everything I do lately is wrong... I just want some answers & support. I don't hardly ever go out with friends or anything like that mainly because I'm not working so I have no money. I'm constantly asking my parents or friends for money for diapers, etc since I can't seem to find a job. We had a little mishap with my car last month so it's at a car repair shop until I can pay the towing bill & the storage fee which I don't have the money for. I just feel like my son is all I have at this point other than the few close friends I have & my family. I feel like my fiance is there when it's convenient for him. We used to go out all the time in town but now we hardly ever do. I'm trying to figure out if I have done something wrong???  I am going back to school next month so I'm looking forward to that.
