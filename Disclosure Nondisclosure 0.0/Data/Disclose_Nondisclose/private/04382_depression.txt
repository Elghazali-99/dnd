For over ten years now I've been plagued by depression, and suicidal thoughts and attempts. I kept it to myself for years. I finally got help a little over a year ago. I was very low at the time. I'm on meds, seeing doctors and counsellors, and my friends and family are trying to be supportive. But its like I'm always stepping on eggshells now. For a bit, things were getting better, but no more. Now I just try and get though each day and its so draining. I'm so tired. I try to do everything to keep myself positive and active, but now that has become somewhat of a mask. People see the mask of the recovery and tell me what a good job I'm doing... but I'm not. Each day I'm a bit more drained, a bit more hopeless. I try to tell them I'm not getting better. I try to tell them I'm getting worse. But all that comes out is the mask of recovery. The feigning of the positive to try and keep myself going. I can't keep this up any longer. I've become an isolated recluse. I don't have the energy to go out, to find work, to do anything really. I feel completely lost . Will it ever get better? Or is this my life now?
