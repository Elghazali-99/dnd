Hi,
 My aunt is 45 and has paranoid schizophrenia. She has been suffering for a number of years and her "incidents" of paranoia & aggression have become more pronounced & closer together over this time. The problem apart from how heartbreaking it is, is that the object of her jealousy, derision and aggression is predominantly my mother (my aunts' older sister)
 On Tuesday of this week she sent my mother flowers by way of apology for an earlier run in. By Thursday my mam was again on the receiving end of her acidic behaviour. She is claiming my mother had an affair with a man she was in love with, she has claimed that my mothers partner is MY babies father. She warns my mother to "watch her back" or that if she doesn't call her back she will "suffer the consequences"
 My mam keeps going back. It breaks her heart, she wants to be there for her sister. She is genuinely afraid though and frankly so are we.
There is limited support in Ireland for the family of sufferers & none of us know what to do from here. My aunt has attempted suicide on many occasions, however, they are never earnest (she is incredibly smart and her attempts are purely for attention)
 Should my mother ignore her, get bolchy (she is like a puppy being kicked, maybe if she stood up for herself the shock would make my aunt think twice) we really are at a loss.
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
 J
