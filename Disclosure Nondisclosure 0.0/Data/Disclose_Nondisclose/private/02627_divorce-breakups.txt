So my ex broke up with me 12 months ago after 4 years.. I got diagnosed with anxiety and became very depressed really not myself so I guess I wasn't the person he fell in love with.. 
The break up hit me hard especially when after a month he moved on and moved in with someone else.
I eventually made new friends started going out and enjoying life.. he messaged me telling me he still loved me and made a big mistake but i told him it was to late, I was single but happy with my life..but now I seem to be back where I started I can't stop thinking about him and whenever I see him he stares at me even if he is with his girlfriend which makes me think about him more... i'm wondering if i made a mistake in saying no..I was doing so well now I'm sad all the time and I don't have many friends can't find a job can't move on! It's so hard. I want to be happy I want my time to shine but I feel so down no matter how hard I try to be happy and succeed in life it just isn't happening for me. Any advice, similar stories, all welcome.
