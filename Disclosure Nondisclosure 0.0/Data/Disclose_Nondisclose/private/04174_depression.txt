Hi everyone! I'm new to this forum but not med help its a great site. Well I'm afraid that I don't know where to start and be warned I'm a rambler... so I have been battling depression for years and finally got help 2 years ago and had been taking pristiq while I never felt "better" completely I was able to function and build some better coping mechanisms. About 3 months ago I quit cold turkey withdrawal was awful. But seeing as hubby and I were trying to conceive and it being a category c drug (and me already being high risk while pregnant) I got it in my head it would be better to quit and see how things would go and if need be after breastfeeding start over. Happy to say I'm 2 months now and gelt ok for a little while. But I'm losing it. I'm falling back on old habits that were still an issue but were minor hiccups as opposed to big problems. For example I can't answer my phone unless its my hubby or bff. I don't open my mail and very rarely leave the house my poor 3 year old deserves better and her daddy is in Brazil for work so all she has is a piece of crap constantly crying, or yelling mommy. I don't have any patience everything irritates me I'm drowning. Although I do have a few good moments the 'tape recorder' in the back of my mind fills me with doubt and despair. Please someone tell me what to do. Do I go back on my meds to be better? I feel like such a failure and really thought I could handle this and live without them I don't want to depend on them but I'm lost. Its just going to get worse. Thanks for reading sorry its so long please if anyone can help me I'd be so grateful.
