My wife and I are experiencing menopause. SHE to be exact, however, it effects me as much as her. I am trying to cope with her total withdrawal. I know she can't control her emotions but it still hurts the way she avoids me and secludes herself from the rest of us. Her sexual desire is NON existent. She is 47 years YOUNG and can pass for 25 EASY. If I tell her that she's beautiful, she thinks I want sex. If I try to hug her, she thinks I want sex. If I say ANYTHING much at all to her, she becomes "stressed". If I DON'T talk to her and try to give her space, she thinks I am mad and she gets "stressed". When we go to bed, she says she's cold and wants me to snuggle. The next night, nothing different except when I try to snuggle with her, she gets upset and accuses me of wanting sex and we start arguing. This started about a year ago and each DAY it gets worse until we are (I) am at my wits end. She REFUSES to see a gynecologist. She went to a endocrinologist for blood work and they say it's perfect. I suspected Thyroid because of hair loss, weight gain,dry skin,severe mood swings and memory loss. I love her with every bit of my being but something HAS to give. As I said, a year plus and it's getting worse with NO end in sight.
