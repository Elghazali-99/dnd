My entire life my mother made me believe I was Bipolar and I always knew I wasnt, and I finally got re-diagnosed and my psych told me I had BPD and I had no idea what it was until I read several books and it explains everything. My anxiety is also worse because I also have PTSD and General Anxiety Disorder. I take 15mg of Buspar 3 times a day and I use to take 1mg of klonopin at night, then switched to .25mg of during the day and .75 at night..then .75 at night. Now shes trying to just take me off of it in general and I dont think its a good idea. She is trying to get me to take only .5 at night right now but its not working. My anxiety and sleep patterns are way worse. Now I cant even sleep with 200mg of Seroquel and .75 of Klonopin. We did well going down to .75 but going down to .5..I think I should go back to .25 during the day and .75 at night. The problem is this is a community health system for people with no money or insurance. I have Medicaid so these doctors are against giving meds like klonopin. I live in Northern VA so if anyone knows a good Pysch that takes Anthem Health Keepers Plus HMO that would be great. Other than that I want to know how others treat their anxiety especially when something stressful and upsetting happens out of nowhere almost every day. How do you cope? I cant sleep...and that makes my anxiety much worse and alot less able to tolerate anything ontop of having BPD.
