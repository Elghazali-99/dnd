hi all,
today a friend of mine sent a book to me called "I hate you- don't leave me", she had mentioned to me before about being borderline but only skated over the subject.
i have been treated for depression for the last 8-10 years, but started having symptoms at the age of 12, including aggressiveness (sp) violent mood swings, over spending, difficulty retaining relationships (being over clingy, then being afraid when anyone got too close) self harm, and 2 attempts at suicide.
i am not sure if this means i am borderline or not, or whether it is just symptoms of depression. none of my moods seem to last more than a few days, and i feel like i am yo-yoing?? from one mood to another all the time. I have recently managed to completely alienate a good friend with my paranoia?? i thought she didn't want me around any more, so i pushed before she could!!
i am married with 3 children now, and although i love them all, i don't allow them to get too close to me, i tend to "be busy" when they want a hug.
i feel like i am going crazy sometimes, and it sometimes feels like i am looking in on myself, knowing after the fact, that what i have said or done is wrong, but by then it is usually too late to do anything about it.
i am being referred to a psychiatrist and am hoping that he/she will be able to help, but am not sure whether to mention these things to him/her???
after being labeled as a depressive for so many years, i fear what a new diagnosis may mean
i am extremely confused at the moment, and any advice would be received gratefully
Thanks
