I don't know when it started, maybe it's always been there. I am 16 years old. and ever since I was a kid ive been at times extremely depressed. First when my parents got divorced, I remember that I was about 5 and I always used to cry whenever my dad left me at school, I hardly got to see him, and whenever I did it was always for a day or two. I also remeber being sexually abused, well more like taken advantaged.Not raped. By my fathers friend. I was only five, and I didn't know any better. My father also has a hearing disability therefor, whenever my father was asleep he used to approach me. I have never told anyone, until now... At the age of 10 i was bullied by many kids at school. I got into alot of fights.Which probably damaged me more psychically. And then I started at a new school, eventually I got some cool friends. So...let me fastforward a bit. And now im here. 16 years old. Got some great friends, they always make me laugh. But that's only at school. When I get home... thats when things start.
For some odd reason, I have issues connecting with people. I have never once liked my relatives. Not even kids. I despise my family except for my mom. And i dont know why. They're all so very nice, but I just cant connect with them. Also I am now spending a whole week at my fathers place every other week. He sort of brainwashes me. Tells me that people are evil and that life *****.So, I'm a girl who can't hug other people without getting panicked.
I cry myself to sleep, well I hardly get any sleep, i've been doing that for years. I've recently started cutting. And smoking now and then, not so much really. I don't get it. I have great friends, I go to a great school, I enjoy myself at school, I'm not the depressed girl when I go there. And I really dont think so much about the past. But why the hell am I depressed?
What's wrong with me? I'm afraid to live, but also afraid to die.
Also I kind of enjoy to disappoint people.
Hell It's all really mixed up.
