My mother has been getting seemingly worse over the years, pushing away me, my sister (Who just left for good), my father, and my grandmother. Around other people such as the neighbors, she is nice. They can't believe what she is like at home. She gets angry at everything, no matter what you do. For example, I cleaned the house and she got angry at me for cleaning stuff I shouldn't of. The next day, I didn't clean that place and she yelled at me for not cleaning it. 
 She also talks to her 40 year old sister in another country for 2-3 hours on the phone every day, and they email each other all day at work. Her sister is the only person she gets along with from our family. When arguing, she yelled at me for not telling the truth. My dad then said something to her, and she yelled at us saying that she feels like she is in court. 
 One day, she got mad at my sister and left her at the bus stop (On her way home from work). After my grandmother picked her up, my sister was crying and such, and my mother got mad at her for being upset and told her to be angry next time.
 If you get frustrated or angry at her, she will flip it around making you feel bad or trying. She starts yelling, so nobody says anything to her.
 But the thing is, sometimes she is nice, and acts normal. This lasts for a few minutes, but sometimes she is nice for the biggest part of a day.
 My neighbors think she has a mental illness or something seriously wrong with her, so I want to see what you guys think.
