im middle aged and have had several mental conditions due to the death of my mother at 7 yrs old since then ihave not ever felt i was a normal person i became attatched from society and grieve in one way or another daily i have never had a true friend i could count on was physcally and emotionly abused by step parent i have deep wounds inside which are weeping constantly i have now just seperated from the one true love i ever had of 10 years and in such pain and for 3 weeks now i have cried daily im so scared of the inner thoughts of late i am in homeless shelter and my empty feeling inside is taking over me to a point that my whole life has been not worth the pain im in it brings me to tears just to say im a man who has so much to give in life and these emotions are making me feel otherwise 
 i write to express
  when life becomes too much at times 
we sit and think of loving rhymes
when you feel you your thoughts are true 
i sit and think my thoughts of you 
for your the one who showed me love 
for your the one sent from above 
now your gone out from my life
my heart is broke how will i survive
