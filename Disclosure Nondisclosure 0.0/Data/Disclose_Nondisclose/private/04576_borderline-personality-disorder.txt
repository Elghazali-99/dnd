Ok, where to start i have been treated for anxiety, depression, ocd, panic attacks and ptsd for years but it never workerd i felt like i total failure. Well recently my therapist got me to fill out a questionaire for personality disorders, he never directly told me the results, well he said i had trouble recognizing and regulating my emotions and i lacked a sense of self, i am also very sensitive to all types of critisicm, or rejection or people leaving me, i constantly analyize my therapist as to what mood is he in or how he is reacting to me, i do get bad mood swings and depression and suicidal but i don't consider myself to be extreme enough to have bpd but i seem to fit the criteria, i asked him recently about the questionaire and he said it showed him that i had serious personality issues but he never said the words bpd so i wonder am i really, i am confused, someone also told me that if i was bpd its unlikely that he would tell me. He now wants me to see a psychotherapist now instead of him because he said he can't help anymore but i don't want to leave him, he is the only person i have ever trusted and i feel let down, i don't know how i will cope in psychotherapy without him. I just wanted to ask does anyone think i sound like i have bpd i am very confused and it stresses me out alot.
