Hi all! So...I'm 16 and pretty sure I am depressed just sort of in denial of it I guess you could say. I keep assuring myself I can get through it all alone but lately I'm not so sure...this all started my freshmen year, I'm a junior now. I've been waiting for this numbness to go away, and sometimes it does! But when it finally does wear off the results are miserable and I find myself wishing once more to just simply be numb. Yet when I'm in this dull phase of sorts I have to cope with it. Somehow, someway. So I cut. Alot. Of course I'm not proud of it and I have been desperately trying to stop. To slow down the process in some manner but it's not going away anytime soon. Keeping all this in mind now there is a new problem adding major stress to all of this. PTSD. It's been a good 4 to 5 months now since the incident that I'm still struggling with happened. Long story short there was a wreck that happened to someone else we stopped to help, I was told not to go closer, but I ended up getting too close (stupid me, I know.)  I saw too much and...the person died that was in the accident. In front of me. So now...I'm just kind of here. No feeling. No emotion except for this fear of telling my parents who I know would help but might treat me differently. It's all getting worse. Everything. Grades are dropping, being social is becoming a chore and self harm is at its peak. I'm sorry this post is so lengthy...didn't mean to put all of that but it's the shortest way I can put it. But I'm sorry...if anyone at all could just...tell me what I need to do I would appreciate it. Thank you for your time.
