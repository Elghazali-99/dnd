I hadn't told my husband that I had joined this support group and when he found out, he got angry.  He and my brother say that there is nothing wrong with me.  They say that I just feel sorry for myself and that I can't deal with life.  My husband is an amazing person.  I am 26 years old and my husband has three children, I love them very much but it is so stressful, the homework and lunches and laundry, I am overwhelmed.  To top it all off we just moved completely across the country from our families for employment reasons.  I feel alone and sad all of the time.  I have no drive, I don't like to leave the house and I rarely leave my house alone.  As I said, my husband is a great person but I think that dealing with my mood swings and bad attitudes are realy starting to wear him down.  I have thoughts of suicide but I don't contemplate it, if that makes any sense.  I have never done any type of self mutilation it my life but I recently began to burn myself, yeah I know it's crazy, no one else knows this.  My mother feels the same way as my husband and brother, that there is nothing wrong with me.  I have no support at all.  All I desire is enough happiness to function normaly in life.  I have blow ups that come out of nowhere.  At times I feel that I am losing controll.  What can I do?  Please help.
