Here are the symptoms I experience, and I don't know if this could be bpd, so if any of these sound familiar let me know:
1. I often stalk people. I still stalk my boyfriend's ex who he hasn't seen in 7 years.
2. I act like a child often times. For example, I'm having a talk with my professor and my voice and behavior becomes of a 5 yr old. I act like a small child at home all the time (I live with my boyfriend, he is used to it by now).
3. I start acting out when I'm bored. Almost like I have to be in the center of attention all the time.
4. In class I would take out a jar of pill and start popping them just to get attention.
5. I smoke because of what's on in my head.
6. I was left by my mother when I was 10 yrs old and lived with an emotionally unavailable and controllling father and abusive brother till I was 18 (I'm 25 now).
7. I don't have any friends other than my boyfriend.
8. I change jobs often because I start lying/making up stories about myself that I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up with, so I just quit the job.
9. I have this need of constantly taking rides, because I often get into these short, elevated moods where I have to do something and running or driving my car fast is the only thing that releases my energy.
10. I get rapid mood swings; I may be sad for 15 min and then laugh out loud to myself for another 15, then be ok for a couple of hours and back to either overly sad or euphoric for a short periods of time.
11. My mother was hospitalized for depression when before she had me.
12. I have superiority issues with other people. I can be an ******* to others and really not care about their feelings, not even remember 5 min later what I said.
13. I can sometimes be up whole night because of my sudden euphoric mood swing.
14. I usually end up messing up any friendships that I'm part of.
 Does any of these sound familiar?
