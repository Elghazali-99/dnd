How do I deal with a 15 year old step daughter who deliberately does the opposite of whatever she is told to do or not do. When you ask her to explain her movements, or her failures, she would spin different versions depending on how much proof you have. Sometime last year I would record our conversations with her. When I replayed the clips on a HiFi she would deny she ever spoke that even if it was jus a few moments ago she would blatantly denies withmore lies and I would record and compare the two versions she would come up with a third version. And at 15 I never expected to see her scrible/write walls and furniture with anything from water markers and pens to knivers and ottle tops, anythig that can leave her name and boys' phone numbers including a home theatre system I bought in December last year.
 the mother thinks i need to et her be or i move out. i think she is a spoilt brat. at times she cries when her daughter is  reported by neighbors to be mixing with wrong crowds and then she asks me to talk with her.
 I have lost any respect for her as a daughter even though I moved in with them when she was 6 and raised her as my own. Her father died while in prisonwhen she was under two years. Now I'm lost, I don't know if our marriage can end because of a step daughter. Help me please.
