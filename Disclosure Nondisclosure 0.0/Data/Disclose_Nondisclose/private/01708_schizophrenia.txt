for the last 14 months i have been hearing things in my head, I'm not sure if they are real or i have just been getting confused. I hear whispering sometimes and ill turn around and look at my friends and ask them if they are whispering... and they stare at me with a confused look. when i sleep i wake up sometimes from someone saying my name softly, i shoot straight up and no one is there.. and in the last month i have been listening to music and i hear the word "Jump" louder than the music, i take off my headphones because i think someone just shouted really quickly but that's never the case, that has only happened 3 times though.. so maybe I'm just paranoid i don't know i was just wondering if these are symptoms that anyone else can relate too. i feel like someones always around me trying to say something. i have been on only 1 medication for ADHD that i can think may have some kind of mental affect. Its adderal (amphetamine salts) and i don't abuse it. i have been taking it since i was 14, i'm 24 now. Does anyone know whats going on with me?
