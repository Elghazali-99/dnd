I'm 19. For as long as I can remember I've never been able to connect with other people. I've never been able to make friends or even had any interest in making friends. When I'm around strangers or in a crowd I get anxious to the point I tremble, hyperventilate, my pupils dilate and my heart rate goes crazy. I go through depressive episodes that can last a few hours to a few weeks. When I have these episodes I do irrational things like cry/laugh for no reason, try to hurt myself, think of suicide, and just plain dark thoughts. I get angry or happy for no reason. when i  get angry during these episodes i lose control of myself, do violent things and sometimes even speak differently. my parents just say im a brat or a ***** but i truly cant control myself when im like that. About a month ago I was going through one of these episodes and I began to hear a male voice whispering in my ear. I couldn't understand what it was saying but it sounded like a snake or something. I would feel hands on my neck and see shadows and bugs on the floor. I also began seeing a strange creature in my dreams that would whisper to me the same way. somehow i came up with the name Grainger and began calling the hallucination that. It was scaring me so I went to the psychiatrist and he dubbed it as schizoaffective disorder of the depressive state. I've been put on seroquel xr since then and I don't hear voices anymore but my personality and ways that I talk still fluctuates and I still have major anxiety and I get random bursts of euphoria or energy out of the blue. I don't know why or what is causing this. Is it schizoaffective disorder or something more?
