What alternative methods of relaxation have you used? Does meditation decrease anxiety? Will yoga help me feel more relaxed? 
 Right now I'm coping with multiple life-stessors that are chronic versus acute; unemployment, lack of health insurance, socially isolated b/c friends don't invite me out (they know I'm broke), strained family relationships (mother financially supporting me through grad school right now while I try to find any kind of work), weight gain, oversleeping, lack of structured schedule, may lose financial aid if I don't pass one of my fall courses this year. 
 Oh. And I'm almost 40; no children, not married. So I have no one to support me or help me and my unemployment doesn't meet my basic needs, so I live off my student loans and the money my mother lends me. (I plan to pay her back). 
 I feel very alone in this situation. And I don't want to resort to antidepressants. I'd much rather tackle my stress the natural way. 
 So, I'm open to your suggestions. 
 Thanks.
