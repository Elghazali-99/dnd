Good morning or evening or day or night or afternoon guys and whassup. I have been really pissed off at something some of my friends have been saying to me lately. They have been hurting and when I try to help, I get carried away sometimes and that could land me in all sorts of monumental and extremely frustrating ****. 
 They know I want to help people when they are hurting and they know I get carried away but they also know I am rather annoying when I get carried away. So they say stuff like:
 "I know you're a really caring and good friend but please don't act like you know me."
 Which made no sense to me at the time, cause it was so oxymoronic, but now I am starting to understand what they mean.
 Anyway, when I was still angry at them and I though they were still angry at me, whenever I got near them, I would rush up. You know, adrenaline, churny stomach, sweaty palms, shaking, rigid movements etc.
 I don't want to have to avoid people when they are giving.me the ***** but maybe sometimes I have to. That's probably why I nearly died when I lost my friend because I was trying to apologise and hanging out with our mates, I wasn't pulling myself out of the situation.
 But is there a better way of anger management than just walking away. You don't want to have to walk away forever and sometimes walking away is simply not possible. 
 So just some methods of anger management please. Other than exclusion. Thank you.
