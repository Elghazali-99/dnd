Hey, the thing is im 14, 15 in april. I have felt really depressed for like 1 year - 2 year. last year i had councelling but it never worked for me it didnt help. My mum would accuse me of attention seeking so ever since ive just locked everything up inside and because of locking it up, i feel im starting to loose control in myself. I wouldnt like to admit before that i needed help. There was a time in my life, about 3 months ago where i was using alcahol to cope with life, because things got that bad, one day i went into school really drunk, and got sent to hopsital. Once i was back in school i had the teachers bothering me, but i just wudnt admit and i wudnt tell enyone. Ive now really am pleading for help. I have being worried about myself because im had really bad memory. Like someone would tell me something and a second later i would forget everything i said. My mum would tell me do to something and i would forget and just end up walking off. Other than a bad memory, ive had bad concentration. Ive not being able to do school work, id get really confused and forget what i was doing, and i would feel like a failure, i would get really upset and the teacher would say shonie dont give up now you can do this, and id just have tears and not do my work. Im really lacking in my coursework because of this, now i dont know if its eny thing to do with just being depressed or is it because i had concusion when i was 7. Would there be eny damage to my brain? Also, the other night i had a really wierd feeling because i was sat crying on my bed and i felt i was changing into someone else, i had these severe thought of suicidal, just slashing and stabbing myself, i actuly felt i could just do it straight away. I get uncontrollable crying alot, but i Just cant seem to talk to someone about this, because i still feel like people are guna think am attnetion seeking, but im getting really concerned about myself. I cant explain how i feel, but i am really down. what should i do ?
