I am very confused about the relationship i have with my partner, we have been together 13 years, sometimes he is very nice and understanding and supportive and helps me out alot in the house and with our children as i suffer from depression, anxiety and panic attacks. The other side is that he is very bad tempered he has hit me in the past but not for a while, now its name calling and making me feel bad as a mother this doesn't happen all the time which is why its so confusing. I do get scared when he loses his temper and my therapist says its emotional abuse and that my partner is controlling but if this is the case why don't i see it, i won't leave because i think our relationship is ok and he loves me and i need to feel loved as my family have nothing to do with me and i don't have any friends just him and i need to be with him, we have so many good memories that to leave him i would lose all that. There is alot of arguing in our house and i try to keep the peace alot and try to keep him happy by doing what he wants. Am i wrong, is he abusive and i can't see it i am really confused.
