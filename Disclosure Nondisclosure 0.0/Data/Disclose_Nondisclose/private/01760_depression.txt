I posted before, I can't name all I've been on but remeber Prozac, Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, Effexor (Oh God, withdrawls..never again), Remeron (eternal sleep even when awake). Have done some recent research and the crowd points a lot to Zoloft, Lexapro and Celexa. 5 months ago I went off all meds. I've been dealing with a rough year due to divorce. I recently retired (still young though) and simply don't have a lot going on in life. The problem: I'm just so sad all the time and don't laugh or feel the joy like I used to, I have no get up and go in the morning and  though I may wake at 6:30 I feel like; Why get up? Then during the day I'm motivated to do nothing when once I was always at the gym or doing something healthy. I NEED all that back. I take Klonopin and have for years for the anxiety and control my doses pretty well but I need that med that is going to pull me out of this depression (I know what it is). Please respond guys and gals. I know everyone is different but a lot of times you read into one drug and see a lot of similiar healthy helpers. I want to be the one to recommend to the doc (who is a family practitioner, not a Psyc) this time. 
So here is the info: Those other meds when I was on them weren't miracle drugs- but that said I certainly didn't feel this bad. So do I go back on what I was on
OR
Do I take a shot at Zoloft, Lexapro or Celexa...all which I have not tried. I do not want to gain weight. I was on Remeron 3 weeks and gained 10 pounds...an no not from the gym and still haven't been able to shed it in 5 months.
Keep this in mind- I'll give anything a try rather then feel as hopeless and unliving as this.
Open floor, thank you'all
