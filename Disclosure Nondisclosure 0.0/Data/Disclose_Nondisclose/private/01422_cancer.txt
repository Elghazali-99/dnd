I've had a sort of lump on the back left side of my neck for about 2 years now. It's not very big, and it's situated in between the back of neck and the side of my neck kind of where the hairline begins. It has not grown in the two years since i've noticed it, it isn't sore to touch or painful whatsoever. As well, I can only feel it at certain angles and i really have to push into my skin to feel it, it feels hard like it could be a bone or a muscle or somthing. I had a friend who felt it and told me that it's just a muscle in the neck and it's not really a lump, but if i feel the same area on the right side of my neck there is no such muscle or lump there. I am starting to worry about it, especially due to the fact that I have anxiety problems and hypochondria. Also I had the H1N1 flu about 2 weeks ago and logic leads me to believe that if I had a cancerous lump in my neck for 2 years, that flu would have take a serious toll, however my flu only lasted 2 days, and the doctor said that my immune system must be significantly strong if I was able to get over it that quickly. Can anyone give me their opinion on whether or not to get this checked out by a doctor? A part of me really wants to, but another part of me based on my hypochondria thinks that it may just be a muslce or somthing, and the doctor is going to kick me out for wasting his time.
