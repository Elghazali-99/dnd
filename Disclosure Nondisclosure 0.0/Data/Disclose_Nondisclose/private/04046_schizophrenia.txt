Hello All,
I was going to ask this in the post traumatic area, but feel you all are my friends and familiar with hearing voices.
I have thought this and would like your input on it., 
Most of you know that the voice I hear which almost is non-existant now for me is of an energy or spirit and this is my belief.
I am interested though in all reasons as to why people hear voices also and believe in support and knowledge in this area.  I was wondering about this possibility for hearing voices.
Is It Possible??? -  Post Trauma
I wonder if it's possible that the trauma caused from hearing a voice or voices can cause a post traumatic after shock (reoccurance) of hearing a voice or voices again and again that are not actually present.
I would not rule this out.
When traumatized so badly it can be possible that we re-live/have flashbacks of the trauma and in this case the trauma would be hearing the voice again and again when it's not actually being heard, but rather a post traumatic occurance.  How long can this also go on for??? 
What do you all think???  Is it possible that some of the voice(s) one hears can be  post traumatic flashbacks of sorts???
