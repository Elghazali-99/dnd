When i was 14 i moved from scotland to france and i was so excited but when i got here i felt upset and alone, it got better but for the past couple of months i dont know why but i have got really depressed and when i turned 16 in september i started work and it got worst, i cant get on with my mum, i never talk to her and when she talks to me i bite her head of we cant have a normal conversation, i cant get on with her and now she speaks to me nice just incase i shout, i dont know why im like this, i feel so alone as if no one knows how i feel and its as if everyone is talking about me, i dont care about life or work or anything right now, i have thought about how better it would feel if i wasnt here. I saved a depression site for teens to my favourites and my mum said to me what the hell you doing you aint depressed, I went to the doctors because i was ill and i told him that i felt depressed too and he said we ll talk about it later even he doesnt care. I feel so lonely and i know i cant talk to my mum she wont believe me, when i go out i feel better but when i come back to my house i feel so depressed and i cant see my self having a happy future, i am gay as well and every boyfriend i have had has took advantage so i dont see the point in life, your born to die so whats the point in living???
