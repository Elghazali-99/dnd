I have a friend that takes the supplement Relora made by the company NOW! she is aware that this supplement effects the hormone cortisol in your body. She is taking this supplement because she says it helps her deal with stress, anxiety, she is more calmer, and in control. She says that it has even cured her nervous tick. 
I am in a relationship with this woman, and we have only been together for 4 months and one of these she has been taking this supplement. Things used to be wonderful for us, spent lots of time together, had a wonderful sex life, but now it seems she dont even want to be bothered, she wants to relax and be by herself as often as she can, she says that she cant handle a relationship on top of school and work, it is just too much. She has pushed me away and i wonder if the supplement has anything to do with her pulling away from me. She is not satisfied with her body, there fore she dont want me to touch her....can you help me, is there anyway that her actions, and withdrawaling herself from me, could be the side effect of this supplement or lack of cortisol!
