Hi
 Ive had PTSD due to childhood trauma for a very long time. It has absolutly effected my inimate relationships. I also have a pelvic condition(a few of them) which cause chronic pain. Although i have these conditions I also believe my PTSD worsens the pain psychologically when i try to be intimate with my partner. Its happened many times before but I also wasnt in relationships that were good or healthy for me. Almost like I would choose a partner I knew i wouldnt have to be truely in love with so that I didnt have to grow a true intimate connection. 
Im taking pain killers for my pain until my surgery and even then i find myself not being able to have sex. The love and deep connection with my fiance are defenitly there. I've never had such a true relationship before. She is aware of my issues and I even went as far as to go on lexapro and klonopin to help improve my anxieties and panic attacks. The problem is that after I was triggered by someone who was innapropriate with me as a child I began falling into old patterns. I began having night terrors and getting angry at everything. my fiance has stood by my side working on this with me. taking baby steps with me. But I feel so incredibly guilty that Im not able to share my love with her in that way. I find myself trying to make up for it in other ways. cooking dinner every night, refusing to let her pay the bills...just trying to take care of her in any way i can as I'm afraid she'll find intamacy somewhere else and leave. 
My question is this...Does anyone else have this issue with their partner? and what are some of the things I can do for my PTSD to help get back to a place where we're enjoying our sex life again?
 thanks:) amph(sosickofIC)
