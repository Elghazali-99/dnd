I have a brother who is an alcoholic and really has issues with people or crowds gathering (family too). He does get SSI for having an annuruism(head injury) and is disabled for it. he cant work but he can sure be very manupulative in wrong ways.  Weve had confrontations before and when police show up,  after holding him down to settle down, he tells police I hit him and have gone to jail for couple of days.  but when I get out (no charges at the end). This WILL happen again. My mother is getting the worst of it with migraine headaches and stress. Im wondering that if we call 911 and let them know that he does need help  other than jail like mental hospital  can they take him involuntary if my mother chooses too cuz we are running out of time..IM 42, hes 43, my mother is 65 and doesnt need him to act like this. I  know he will choose not to go but something needs to be done.  The police told us that unless there is another incident, to call 911 and tell them its a "CIT" thing.  We are in nevada.   Please some advice.                Stressing in Nevada
