Hello I'm 18 Years old and very, very stressed out at times. I have been having many problems that the doctors don't even seem to know what is wrong with me and just blame it on STRESS! I know that is just isn't stress that is causing all of these problems and that is what they said before another doctor found out that I have had a  Chiari Malformation. I have had surgery to cure it in 2007, and was hoping that it would cure my many problems, but no it didn't unfortunately and I'm so upset and stressed. This in turn is making me really irritable and mad at times. I seem to be getting really mad and discouraged at myself all of the time anymore and often end up screaming and yelling at my Mom. I feel really bad about that and end up crying after words. :( I just don't know what is causing all of this built-up "rage" lately, but I don't like it and it seems like my personality is changing. I have been trying to stay calm, but all of my worry, stress, and sleep deprivation from my Fibromyaligia is really causing me to become very irritable very fast anymore. Could it be coming from my sleep deprivation or my stress? Or is it possible that it could be coming from whatever is causing my many other problems? 
 Please if anyone knows what is wrong with me that I'm having all of this "rage" lately, please don't hesitate to respond. Thank You sooo much it is greatly appreciated!!! :)
