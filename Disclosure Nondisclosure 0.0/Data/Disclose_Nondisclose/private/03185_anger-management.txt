So I came to this group because I thought people wouldn't judgment here and that I could be open and honest
I need to confess something it's been on my mind for a while and it's really bothering me I know it's wrong
Ever since I was a little kid I have showd aggression towards my pets it makes me feel horrible I've never beat the **** out of animal it's not like that but when I am under huge stress or they make me irritated I do sometimes a lot of the time hit and kick them...yes I know incredibly wrong that is I have been hiding a secret for years and I need to get it out it's extremely disturbing to me that I can't control myself enough to not do that it's horrible most the time I do it without thinking and I feel horrible about it I've done it so many times sometimes I don't even realize that I do it until after  i'm done I've never gone in detail with anyone about this before not even my therapist makes me feel completely horrible like the worst person on the planet 
 I came here because I just had a son I'm 22 years old and I'm a single mother and I need to learn how to control me I would never in a million years want my son to exhibit any of that kind of behavior or know that I have that kind of problem I really want to learn how to get my anger under control before my son is of age to understand please help me like I said I came here because this is an anger forum and I needed help I really would appreciate it if people have their comments to supportive ones I don't need to be told that what I do is wrong that's why am here
 Thanks
