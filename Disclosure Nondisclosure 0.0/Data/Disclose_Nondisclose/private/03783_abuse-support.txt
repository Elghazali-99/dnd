I had my counselling session on Thursday  using relaxation meditation and light hypnosis,I was able to remember feelings and emotions, I was able to connect with the 7 yr old,some people on this forum have had such good advice through my journey I thought I would share my experience with you,don't feel sorry or pity for me this is the best thing I've ever done it has answered many things I'd blocked out. 
  It's not easy to get in the relaxed meditative state,and you really need to have trust in the person that's helping you,For me It's working really well It's hard because it brings everything out in the open again things I've tried not to think about but all that meant was I hadn't dealt with them,I'll be honest with you today I saw and felt what the 7yr old was enduring,I had always blamed her and I actually thought she must of enjoyed it because she never said anything.I've always remembered what he did to me but I had blocked out my emotions and feeling,As of today I know exactly what I was feeling,It hurts to write this but I know eventually it will help me,Through the tears she was in pain it hurt, a 7yr olds vagina and mouth are not meant for penises,I'm sorry this is blunt and to the point,but I learnt a lot today about how strong I must have been.Believe or not it has actually helped me,It's like a weights been lifted.And I'm going to be Okay.Thanks for listening,Every telling makes it that little bit easier. 
I can now say honestly I don't blame the little girl anymore and for the first time I love her with all my heart.
  I have no regrets in living through what was hard to get my feelings and emotions back in balance.  Denise
