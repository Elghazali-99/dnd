 F. C.> = 120 bpm during 02h 26m 25s

////////// 
It all started one months makes! When I was walking in the street to go to a soccer field that is near here. And when I was coming up the heart felt as if he were well off the pace even thought I would faint. I felt a throb and he sped up, then got tired of nothing. But it gave me no soon passed and I could play football on the court. Distracted and not remembered more than I had felt it. But on the same day evening I started feeling something strange like I was very tired and the same heart pounding. The other day I went to school on foot, I felt nothing while going to school. I woke up well after 1:30 a.m. but my heart was strange, I feel a little short of breath, my heart sped up from nothing, and reached a point that I had to communicate the school. Luckily there was a paramedic giving lessons in school and she saw me like this. They told me bedtime I lay, and it is as if it had worsened further. So I sat with her ​​head down. I did not feel sick, but I could feel a bitter taste in the mouth. Gave me water, I took, thought I was preoccupied with something; But I was not the least bit worried about anything, either through some period of emotional stress. The paramedic took my pressure and measured my beats per minute but not constantly let down in any way, was 120 beats for up and she was getting worried because I was sitting and I was 1h with the accelerated rate without lowering any time. It was not lack of eating because I had taken breakfast, much less dehydration because I drink water. The paramedic thought it best to call an ambulance, then was taken by ambulance to the hospital. At the hospital the doctors placed a heart rate meter with sorinho vein (that's all they do in the hospital besides look on your face like you'll be diagnostic for them) and dropped me a long time waiting for the medical care in emergency . The doctor came in and the first thing he asked me is if I was drugging me. And I even get angry at the question but I understand why, of course not drogo me, have full awareness that lie to the doctor about something like that would be the worst thing, and really have not used drugs or accepted anything from anyone who has offered me. Soon after the doctor made ​​some notes out after a long time the guy came electrocardiogram, electrocardiogram and measured my left. Then came the nurse who took my blood to serology and "full" blood count (not included glucose) testing. Measured if I had a fever and I had a low fever of 37.5. Infection but distrusted Series White cells apparently did not explain their incorrect diagnosis because everything was normal according to the following data: 
-> LEUCÓITOS: 8350 / uL 
-> Blasts: 0% 0 / uL 
-> Promyelocytes: 0% 
-> Myelocytes: 0% 
-> Metamyelocytes: 0% 
-> ROD: 0% 
-> SEGMENTED 7.0% or 6430 / uL 
-> EOSINOPHILS: 0% 
-> BASOPHILS: 0% 
-> TYPICAL LYMPHOCYTES: 18.0% 
-> INFÓCITOS ATYPICAL: 0% 
-> MONOCYTES: 5.0% 
The nurse said it could be an infection which would explain the tachycardia. I just really believing that it was an infection because I was very tired and joint pain. The doctor suspected Dengue and everything would be solved, made ​​the tourniquet test and it was positive. So I thought it was ready, I got dengue and I have to stay a long time at home ... With medication to lower the fever and recommendation to visit a cardiologist, forwarded my blood into place to see if you have it or not and Dengue said he'd call in my house if I actually had dengue and make an investigation in the neighborhood. I went home with the still beating heart as it does not have any medications for this symptom, I got the heart so fast all day and I was already pretty tired at night when I got home, I had to take a shower sitting as standing was very tiring for me. Luckily this happened just before going on vacation, so I could rest at home. I avoided exercise, avoided strenuous activity and gave improved. But depending on the activity I was still tired, and sometimes palpitations felt sometimes as if he had a electrical shock to the heart, something we feel after we run a lot. But I was stopped. I spent the day sitting reading something, watching TV, distracting, playing a video game. But I still felt the fatigue and arrhythmias. Occasionally tb dizziness, much stabilized but enough to be noticed. I scheduled a day with the cardiologist of my father, he did an EKG in the clinic prior to the referral of the ancients. When the time came to call me he asked what was happening with me, so I told him everything that happened and was quiet. Examined me, weighed me, measured my heartbeat, my blood pressure and said it has identified a slight heart murmur but nothing worrisome. Asked the following exams and has prescribed me Inderal to lower the accelerated beats 10mg: 
-> T4 - Thyroxine (6.54 ug / dL Reference Values​​: A13,2 5.91 ug / dL.) 
-> TSH - thyroid stimulating hormone (Slightly changed the exam 4.35 UUI / mL CONFIRMED Reference Values​​: 0.51 A4,30 UUI / mL..) 
-> Complete Blood Count (No blood glucose again, but according to the data gave apparently contained within normal limits) 
-> VHS - Hemosedimentation (According examination was normal 3mm and 8mm 1ªhora 2ªhora Reference Values​​: Up to 15mm and up to 30mm in 1ªhora the 2nd hour..) 
-> I Urine (second examination was normal data I consider important: Reaction PH: 5.0 / Glucose: Negative.) 
-> Parasito single sample (According examination was normal) 
-> Electroencephalogram (According examination was normal) 
When the cardiologist came back he told me that there was nothing in the exams he asked justifying my picture, but explained that identified the electrocardiogram done in the hospital a kind of arrhythmia in the heart caused by a defect in the heart from birth electrical circuit. Asked if the milligrams of Inderal were kicking in, and how I was not doing any exercise during those days I said yes, I really did not feel the heart race more. Then he told me to continue taking for about 3 months until the return of 12 in 12 hours and mark the intersection, he said I could have a normal life. I came home and started to distract me and I thought no more about it. Took all of 12 days 12 hours 10 mg of Inderal. But fatigue got worse and I do not know why, it was hard to even think. I bristled and I stopped taking the medicine because I thought they were the side effects of that remedy. I gave improved to stop taking the medicine but was not 100%. One day my mother wanted me to go to the bakery to get bread for my father would come home late.
