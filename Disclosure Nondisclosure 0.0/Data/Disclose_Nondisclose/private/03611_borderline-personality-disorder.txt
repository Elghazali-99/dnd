So just recently I've felt as if something has changed.  I feel like a switch in my head has just turned off.  I began to feel more anxious and depressed for about a week but yesterday I felt like a different person.  I couldn't prepare food (I work at a cafe) like I usually do.  I couldn't focus or think at all.  And all my coworkers knew as soon as they saw me that something was completely off.  A few days before that I was crying a lot.  My friends in a new relationship and it triggered SMS serious feelings about failure and fear of being alone.  Last night I also had an anxiety attack after feeling completely listless all day.  I thought I was going to have a seizure and I kept waking up throughout the night feeling anxious or angry.  I don't want talk with anyone or do anything.  Also i keep having negative thoughts.  They seem to jump out at me from nowhere for no reason.  I know some of these things are symptoms of depression, which I have been diagnosed with at 14 or 15.  But today even though I still feel a bit off, there is still this dullness, I feel better.  The reason I wonder if I have borderline is because I feel like my mood will change too rapidly.  For example today I felt better, I could talk to my coworkers and laugh a bit (not as much as I used to but I didn't mind too much) but then randomly I'd start thinking negative thoughts and I would just spiral back down, then I'd get distracted and feel a bit better.  The strange dull feeling was still there though.  Also when I came home I felt better and thought I would go do some errands, but then I'd get too anxious to leave.  Or I would see my family and clam up again.  Also I will lose my temper at the stupidest things.  Like if I can't get to something I'll feel like punching something.  But after the burst I'll forget about it.  I'm just so confused. Before this troubling week I was feeling pretty good.  Now I feel out o control.  I can't afford therapy and I would just like to talk to someone.
