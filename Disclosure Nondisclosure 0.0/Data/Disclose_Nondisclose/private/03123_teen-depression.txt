I'm 15, female, and completely depressed. I have no hope in anything, and the majority of my days I don't want to get out of bed. I wake up, go to school, sit in a corner at lunch, end up crying by 5th hour, and by 6th hour I'm ready to cut. The only person who can get through to me is my best friend. But he is in a different grade than I am and we have no classes together. We text and talk on the phone a lot, but as soon as he's gone, I'm back to feeling alone. I don't want to feel this way, I really don't. But I do anyways. I was Christian, now I'm not really sure what I believe, I'm heartbroken and lonely and I need help. I'm already on medication and I do see a therapist. A student at school even reported my behavior to my English teacher. Theyre afraid I'm going to commit suicide. I've considered it. But thinking of my best friend being left behind without me, makes me cringe. I can't do that to him. My mom doesn't know about how I feel. Last time I told her, she said it was a game I'm playing for attention. But I'm not. I really wish I was invisible. But I'm not...
 What do I do? I really just want to die...
