English is not my native language, sorry if i'm not clear enough. I've had a bee sting 40-45 days ago, it was on the top of my head. On the same day i had pain in my head, on the next day i also had pain, and i noticed a swelling on the back of my head - more specifically near the left ear - i thought it's swollen lymph node  and i thought it would dissapear after few days, and it really dissapeared after 7-8 days, but then it appeared again. Actually when i woke up in the morning there's no lump, but throughout the day it appears again, after 45 days it's still there. I'm scared because it was swollen lymph node it surely would not last 45 days, can it be head/neck cancer? The lump is maybe 0.5cm in diameter(well it's hard to say if it's exactly round) and it's not hard or soft, just the skin is raised a little bit. Also it's located about 3 cm on the right of my left ear(on the back of my head),and it's near the top of the ear, so i don't think it's a lymph node. The lump was little bigger in the beginning(first 5-10 days) than it is currently(when present). As i said it dissapears and then reappears again, so it's not always there and it's size changes, sometimes it's barely noticeable, sometimes is little bigger.
