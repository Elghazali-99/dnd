hi all,ive recently been diagnosed with having a borderline persoanlity disorder by a physcotherapist and ive been refferred for dbt therapy,at the mo im on prozac and pronalol and i have been prescribed a very low dose of valium,i can take these 1-3 times a day but i try and stick to 1.my moods are all over the place at the moment and i feel very tired too,i feel as though over the last twelve months ive just given up fighting,these feelings i remember having since i was young,and i couldnt understand them.when i was being assessed by the physcotherapist id read a little about bpd and there were alot of simalarities with me.i very mistakenly thought that if i found out what was wrong with me then everything would be ok,,,,but it doesnt quite happen like that does it unfortunately.i feel so miserable at times and sometimes suicidal and then when i feel ok i feel so guilty that i could have thought like that,i have 3 children,2 of whom have special needs.i wish sometimes when im like this someone would give me a kick up the arse cos thats what i feel the need for at times.i consider myself a kind person and i like to help people if i can but then i can think,wheres my help when i need it? its like having very different states of minds and it does my head in !! i see things in black and white alot,what a joy it must be and is at times to be able to read between the lines.im not sure if i need a medication change as i just seemed to get dished out the usual atidepressants if i tell the doctor that a certain one isnt working,even after giving it a good run.sometimes i feel as though i just want to run away but i know i cant,,,,and i certainly cant run away from myself and my thoughts.....regards to everyone,,,,joanne x
