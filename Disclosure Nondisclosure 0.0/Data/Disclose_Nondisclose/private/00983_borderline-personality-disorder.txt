I have had severe clinical depression since (diagnosed) I was 20. I am now 31 with two children. I have also been through eight million therapists, doctors, PAs, psychiatrics, blah blah. Of course because I can't have just one thing, I also suffer from panic disorder, agoraphobia, paranoia, and self harm. But wait! There's more! Just this past summer things became...different. Worse. Unbearable. I would take off and leave my husband with the kids and go driving in the middle of the night to lay in a field for hours. Then the rage took over. Unbelievable, unexplainable, irrational rage. Breaking everything in my path, hurting whomever is in my path with the words that I know will hurt them the worst. I'm the nicest person ever. So this is a total turn around and I CAN'T stop myself. It's become daily, nightly. My family is scared of/for me. I have been inpatient once for trying to kill myself but that was BEFORE the borderline took place. I just need to see other people like me to know that I'm not alone. Thanks for listening.
