I am the youngest of two. 
 I always felt  that my mother never psychologically supported me.
When my husband said  “I feel  sorry for the way your mom treats you” and my niece asked “Why is grandma always talking to you That way?”, it was as if I woke up.  I was so used to her putting me down that didn’t even notice anymore, and was also convinced that I wasn’t good enough!
If I would ask her to babysit my son for 2-3 hours, once a month to out to dinner with my husband but she would get snobbish when I asked so I stopped asking, but she would insist to come to my house the next day and insist that she helps me with the housework.
Today she is 70 and I am 45. I think she loves me but she is always insinuating negative comments about my weight (120lb), my clothes, my spending habits, my house, my cooking, my not being a top student (I have an M.Sc. ), my bad choices in men, house, possessions , my hobbies, my interests …, being such a snob about everything, even though she will brag about other people’s possessions and achievements, especially my brother’s.
The few times I confronted her, she laughed, trying to make me look stupid, wondering out loud why others have such good relationships with their daughters while we don’t.
I try to forgive, forget and excuse her because she had a hard life and I also think my grandmother favored her sister, and because my father passed away when I was a child. In the past she has been supportive in other ways: money gifts, university fees etc., but I feel we are growing apart.  I wonder why it has always been so difficult for her to say something positive to me, even though she has been and still is really nice to my brother.
