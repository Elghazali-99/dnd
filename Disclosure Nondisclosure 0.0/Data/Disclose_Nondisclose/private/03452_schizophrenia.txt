Hello 
 I have experienced transient blindness upon waking April 2011.This occured three times.  Note that I have epilepsy (grand mals since January 2010), and schizophrenia (since March 2011) - both are controlled with medicine.  I am a 47 year old male.
 I currently take serax, seroquel, invega for hullicinations, and divaproex for epilepsy.
 Note that there were no other symptoms, and the transient blindness has not reoccured. However, I had a severe bought of auditory hullucinations April 2011, and was given Invega.  Also, I last had an eye exam October 2011 with an Optometrist.
 My blood sodium has been low in the past which is in part responsible for my past seizures, AND the medicine for my past hallucinations did not work very well.  Now I take salt twice daily to help prevent seizures in addition to the medicine.  The hullications went away within 30 minutes after taking salt in April.
 Blindness – three times when I woke up in the 
morning.  Twice full blindness.  Once my vision was restored in about 10 
seconds.  On the second occasion my right 
eye came back gradually beginning from the right part in about 20 seconds 
before my left eye was restored about ten seconds later.  On the third I become fully blind, but it was
 soon restored. 
When I opened my eyes I saw brightness, no imgages, and a colour pattern in a circle.
 What could be the cause?  The medicine, neurological disorder, conversion disorder ( I ask about conversion disorder because the transient  blindness occured during the severe bought of auditory hullicinations) something else?  Why did it happened only upon waking?
 This is what happened. 
 Thank you for your reply!
