So my Bf and I have been dating on and off for over 7yrs. My family all believe he is using and abusing me. Last August we broke up because I was put in the hospital for depression and suicidal thoughts and I thought it best we took a break. He would call and message me all the tine and it made it hard for me to move on. He has a weed problem, he smokes constantly and gets violent if he doesnt have his pot. Also he says everything is always my fault. He doesnt work he just stays at home. But last year after I broke it off he made promises of changing, that he would stop smoking and that he would get help for his own problems so I let him back in and he made good on those problems for maybe the 1st 2  months... Now he's back to the same **** and says that he will kill himself if I try and leave and that it would be my fault like everything else.. What can i do.. Im so unhappy I want to start having children... But not with him... Any advice would be appreciated... And sorry if this ws at all confusing...
