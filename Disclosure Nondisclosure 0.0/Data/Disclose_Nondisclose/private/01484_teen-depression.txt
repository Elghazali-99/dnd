hiya, this is the first time I have used this, but I feel like I have no choice. I need advice/help.
 Im 15 and I am sure I am suffering from depression and paranoia. This has went on for months now.. I tell myself 'oh its just one of them days' but now it has been left too long and I feel personally like im getting worse. 
I have been in a 10 month relationship, and it was great the first couple of months, but now I am getting too paranoid. I am going to lose this relationship if I dont stop.. but the thing is.. I cant? 
I feel as though everyone is out 'to get me' .. everything and everyone seems to **** me off. 
I cant focus properley at school, I feel like im failing, nothing seems to go in.. I get myself so worked up because I feel like im failing.
I find myself in tears, for no reason.
I wish that I looked different as I hate the way I look, I feel ugly, I care about what everyone thinks of me. 
A big one at the minute is tiredness! I am ALWAYS tired..can never be bothered..
I dont want to sound lile a complete nutcase..but I feel like I shouldnt be alive? I know some people take things too far and say it for attention, but I actually feel like that..
I cant talk to anyone about anything. Im getting worse. I need help, and the worst part is.. nobody understands.
 HELP!
