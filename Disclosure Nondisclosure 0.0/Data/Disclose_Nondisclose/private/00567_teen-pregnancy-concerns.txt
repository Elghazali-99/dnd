hi. Recently I have protected sex with one of my friend . I used condom carefully and we had sex for about 5 min . When I going to release , I pull out from the viginal with condom protected . I try to hold as long as possible and not to release it so quickly. But after a few second I fail to hold it and I ejaculated a very small amount of sperm outside the viginal but still protected with condom . (Not sure is pre *** or sperm but I know there are small amount of  liquid trapped inside the condom tip) . I never ever release inside the viginal even I wear condom because I want to be more extra safe . Then I changed a new condom and want to continue sex . However , my penis become soft after I wore a new condom . I put on lubricant and try to insert inside but not successful . So I give up and didn't continue to have sex again .  After the event , I practiced extra safe by water testing for both condom . No breakage or leaking shown . What is the chances of her getting pregnancy with this incident ? I know this incident is not likely to get her pregnant but I not sure about this . I always practice extra safe even I wear condom . Please help
