Ok my husband was gone for a month and a half, (he was just my boyfriend at that time) before he left things were really rocky, name calling him pushing me around... And I have this problem where I lie to him about little thing I dont mean to or want to I know that I do get scared or how he is going to react, but I know he wont believe me about somethings so I lie about it in hopes that everything will go away or get better, be forgotten... Well when he was gone I had cheated on him. There was this party an I did somethings that Im not proud of, that I deeply regret, take back and wished none of it never happened.. My supposably "best friend" told my boyfriend about most of the things that went on and thru alittle side lies in there..  I feel horrible about everything, my husband gave me the chance to come clean, I have, but I know I left one thing out because I didnt want him to think that I was doing something I really wasnt, now I have comed clean with everything but he doesnt believe me and thinks i have done other things which I cant blame him, I'd be thinking the same thing if the tables were turned... But then I really scared that me hurting him like i did will ruin our relationship our marraige ruin everything... We have a little boy an possible another one on the way? How can we get passed this I dont want him to cheat on me, which Im deathly scared of because he wants me to feel how he feels and I dont want him to leave, is there any advice?!?!?! Why do I lie like I do, why cant I just quit??? How can we get past the stuff that I regret doing?!?!?!??
