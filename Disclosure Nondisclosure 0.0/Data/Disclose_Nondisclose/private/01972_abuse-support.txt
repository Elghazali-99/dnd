when I was 15 my dad used to molest me- this persisted over a period of about 2 or 3 months. this has obviously had mpact, I've sought healing and stuff and that's helped,but now I'm in a place where I just can't stand still having him in my life (I'm 32 so damn, it's been a long time, but whatever, I am where I am). the problem is he is the needy type who says **** like "if I ever lost you/family etc, I don't know what I'd do." my mom and brother know about the abuse because I told them a few years ago and they are both completely the same (mom's still married to him, brother lets my dad and mom babysit his daughter- wtf?!- but he does). so no one gives a ****. so I feel like if I cut the ties to dad, I will also lose mom and brother. do I really need them? probably not, but the ties are strong and it's hard to make  this break. I need advice- whatever you pick up from this and have to offer, I'd really appreciate. at this point though, he gave me a hug a few weeks ago and kissed my neck... and lingered. creeped me the hell out... and I want him the hell out of my life. he's just so damn sick. but my issue is my feelings of guilt, that I'd be destroying him and all that stuff... yet, allowing him in my life is making me sick and destroying me. help! how can I do this? I am overwhelmed and fearful because even though he's a creepy molester, he's my dad. stupid entanglements. thanks in advance.
