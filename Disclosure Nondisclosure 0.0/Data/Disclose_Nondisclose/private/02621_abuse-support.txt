This is not really a qiuestion more like an insight to help others? I Hope? 
 I was systematically abused as a child,physical,sexual,emmotional and psychological and as a result had lots of physical and in all ways abusive relationships when I grew up as I continued with the pattern. I went to therapists,groups and felt often worse and more desperate, eventually having been involved in the writing and as a trainer on a programme called The Freedom Programme with other 'survivors' within the Probation Service which looks at the abusive tactics of the perpetrators I suddenly got lifted from under the weight of believing it was my fault and slowly but surely I became free again and have assisted many women to come through and make a full recovery with their lives. 
But it takes time, as that which we learn through abuse has to be relearnt. We self harm,develop all sorts of multi personalities to cope because we do not feel right about ourselves. We develop illness,cancer and stress related diseases as a result but ultimately if someone gives us a good life line, which makes sense, then we grab it with both hands and pull ourselves out. I am here to offer it.
