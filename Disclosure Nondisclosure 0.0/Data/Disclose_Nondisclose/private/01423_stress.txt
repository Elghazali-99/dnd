I've been having this tightness in my chest. Now, I'm a non smoking, weightlifting, healthy eating woman. I also have a ragweed (among other weeds) allegy, anxiety, AND high cholesterol. (if that helps at all)
normally the chest tightness associated with my panic attacks only lasts until I calm down OR wake up after sleeping. I've been living in the city so it's been forever since I've had problems with my allergies.
HOWEVER, the tightness in my chest has not gone away after this sleep and it's going on day three. I've also recently had pharyngitis and well... let me just list my symptoms. 
 tight chest (like there's a weight on it)
voluntarily coughing up mucus since May.  (occcasionally yellow)
 now, I'm fully aware that allergies can cause these problems AND so can stress and anxiety so I'm very confused which it is and how to treat it, and I'm worried it may be another issue since I've recently gotten over another 
"mystery illness"  the situation that I live in makes it very hard to go to the hospital and I'm not TRULY a resident of Philadelphia so i have no family doctor i can go to.
