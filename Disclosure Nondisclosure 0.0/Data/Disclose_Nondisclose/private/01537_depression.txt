I just like to know if what I was experiencing  had to do with this medicine, Im blown away   Venaflaxine, this a drug for depression, and I"m not happy that my doctor precribed this for me. She gave this to me for symptoms of hot flashes due to menapause, taking me off of Estradiol.  Since I have been on this drug for a year now, it has made me sweat almost constantly, and itch like crazy, I tell her I want off of it. So now I'm taking it every other day till it gone. I was curious if I was going crazy the way my brain is blinking, I'm sweating so bad I can hardly go anywhere, without the embarrament of sweating. I can be sitting in a 20 degree weather and be dripping wet. I looked here to see how long this will take, to get over, and I'm not encouraged, by what I'm reading, but at least I feel better knowing, my brain is not going to explode, cause thats wjhat it feels, like. I may find a new doctor, because the hot flashes I was expericneing were a cake walk compare to this feeling, its just awful.
