I just found this site and felt the need to tell my story. My fiance and I bought a house together in May of this year and by the end of July we discovered his 12 year old son was sexually molesting my 3 year old son, by sucking his penis. We reported it to the authorities and had his son commited to an adolescent behvioral health institiution. He spent 2 1/2 days there and was released because his dad hired him an attorney. Our Dept of Children Services dropped the charges and so did the local police station, even though I wanted charges filed my desires were not considered. The 12 year old goes to therapy hit and miss and due to having the attorney the therapist was instructed not to discuss the sexual abuse with him. 
 I have felt so betrayed by my fiance. I understand this is his son, but it seems he is more concerned with covering his *** than getting him actual help. And I was told by DCFS that although they are dropping the charges if I allow this kid back in my home and he does it again they will remove my son from my custody. 
 In September my fiance moved out leaving me with the financial burden of our house. We continued to see each other though at the end of November I discovered I am pregnant. I was using reliable birth control (an IUD). Now he says he is leaving completely if I have this baby. I would never judge someone who chooses abortion, but for me it's not right.
 This is all just a horrible nightmare. My son, now 4, seems to be doing well. I'm still searching for a therapist for him. He saw one breifly but it was not a good fit. The therapist had no control during sesions my son would just act wild and she never even discussed the abuse with him. He just hated going and asked if he could stop. I know he needs help still.
