Please don't be rude. I really need a serious answer. Hello my name is Stan and I'm 17 and on December 9, 2015 was the first time I ever did anything sexual. Me and this girl were making out and stuff. And things started to get a little intense and she asked me to finger her. As I was going to I started to feel her down there and I got exited really fast as it was my first time. So I was fully erected and my penis was uncomfortable and I had to stick my hand down my boxers to adjust my penis and felt this wetness. I didn't know if it was Precum or sperm cause The thing was that the day before I was wearing the same boxers and I had masterbated and ejaculated in them. Since I was wearing the same boxers I thought that mabe some sperm cells were still living and got on my fingers and went into her vagina as I started to finger her. I told her and she got angry. She msged me on December 29. 2015 saying that she hadn't gotten her period and she was scared she was supposed to get it the 27 and I told her to wait and 4 days later on January 2, 2015 she didn't bleed still so we went to planned parenthood to take two pregnancy tests and they came out negative, she ask the nurse why she hasn't started to bleed and the nurse said something I forgot and gave her this pill and she said that the pill she gave her should make her bleed. And she started to bleed 2 days later on the 3rd of January. The day after she stopped bleeding we took two more tests to be safe and they came out negative and 1 more on January 22 and it also came out negetive. That's 5 negetive pregnancy tests I'm still paranoid like it scared me a lot. Could sperm cells got on my finger and I have inseminated her ? Or am I just overreacting and let it go?
