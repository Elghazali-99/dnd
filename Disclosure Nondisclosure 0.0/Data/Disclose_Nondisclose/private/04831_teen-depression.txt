I'm doing my best at school, but I can barely make it. My grades got worse when I started attending middle school. Even if I study, most of it falls out of my head. My mom isn't helping either. She's making me even more depressed and worried. Mostly becouse she says I won't get a job (I want to be an english translator or work in a bakery shop in the future) becouse I forgot or wasn't able to do my homework. Plus, she is a big Catholic and I'm an agnostic (I basically don't want to be included in any religion. I just don't care and don't want to.) and she says that if I have any problems I should "JUST" belive and pray. One time she started yelling at me, that I am possesed. Just becouse I got a little bit angry with her for accidently breaking something. Yup, I am the one that's always aggressive and angry... But when I was in 5th grade it was worse. Not only she treated me like ****, she actually hitted me and almost threw ice at me. It was terryfing for me (well I was 11 years old). I almost killed myself, because I thought my life was a wreck. I didn't have friends, I was bullied even by my mom. I actually had pills in my hand, and almost took it. Then I started thinking if I REALLY want to do it. What got out me of being so depressed was mostly anime and internet in general. And now it's coming back. I have this weird months when I'm depressed, and after that I start being normal and happy. I fight with my mom a lot when school starts. I don't want it. I feel like I want to kill myself, but I know that the sadness won't disappear, just me. Sometimes I wish I wouldn't have emotions or just run away.
Sorry for this, I just have no idea what should I do with myself. I don't want to talk to my friends about it, because I'm worried that they will ignore me. I wish I'd had friends on the internet, I used to but most of them won't talk to me or forgot about me.
