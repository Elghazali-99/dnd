So on 2nd Feb, my bf fingered me. He did not have any *** or pre *** and he is totally sure about it. My periods were to come around 5th Feb but were late. So i went on with a pregnancy kit test and it showed negative ( i wish i had done this in the morning, but unfortunately did in the afternoon). It showed me negative. Still i was very very stressed. Then on 15th feb i had bleeding which was very light. I thought that it would be spotting but the bext day it was like normal periods with heavy bleeding as i normally have (except the first day did show light bleeding than usual). It lasted for 6 days which is normal for me. But i have back ache and sometimes feel nausea(haven't vomited yet but feel fullness). Breasts don't hurt really on touching or anything but feel a bit pain out of nowhere anytime (especially around nipple) and when i press them or touch them there is no pain. I have lower back pain now and i am very stressed. Can in any way i be pregnant? Kindly reply to this urgently
