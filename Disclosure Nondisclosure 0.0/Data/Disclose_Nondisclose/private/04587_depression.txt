So my whole life I have been this way. I prefer  not to leave the house. I am happy just sitting home and watching tv and playing video games for hours. I would rather not socialize with people if I have to go out. I can go the entire weekend with never stepping foot out of my house. I don't ever have the urge to want to clean the house or do laundry or go to the store to pick up food. I will most of the time order in or snack. I would not say I am SAD and feel like a dark cloud lingers over me but I just don't ever want to do anything or make friends. It's causing a problem in my realationship because I never want to do anything. When I do go out and go shopping I have no desire to buy anything even though I am well off.
 EXTRA: I tried esctasy for the first time. The next day was the most productive I have ever been in a year. I got up and cleaned the house, did the laundry, went to the store, got a tan... so I am just wondering if my happy levels are low ... I am 26 years old FYI.
 PS- I have been like this for much of middle school / high school and my adult life
