I've been married for almost 34 yrs.it has not always been so great.Last year I gave him divorce papers he told me he loved me and didn't want a divorce so I stayed.I asked him if he would help me get out of debt he said yes for me to get rid of my credit cards he would help me he lied.Anyway I went into debt consolidation.I do have a part time job which pay that bill and also I have to pay for my prescriptions Dr. visits and also the deductable which is 1,500.He works all the time like 16 hr days and sometimes never comes home and if he does he goes to the bar for 2 hrs. sleeps for 3 and then back to work.We do not have conversation he does not ask me about my day just tells me what I didn't do.We haven't slept in the some bed for awhile he said it hurts his back and now all of a sudden he want to but not with me in it,also for me there is no sex he's done in like 5 seconds I think no pleasure for either one of us.Really it's not all about that there is just no compassion no respect no conversation please what do I do I really do love him he's my first,help me please.
