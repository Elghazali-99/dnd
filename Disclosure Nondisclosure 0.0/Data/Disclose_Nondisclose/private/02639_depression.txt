I'm 15. Basically, I've had on and off depression for years due to my messed up family life (Alcoholism). I am a very anti-social person and very awkward around people to a point where I think of myself as a worthless waste of skin and sometimes starve myself for days on end which started at the age of 8. I'm a bisexual teen and when I try to hint at my parents that I am but they don't pick up on it and start to make fun by calling homosexual people names, and I can't exactly tell my "friends" (I don't have any) because they think of lesbians as gross and sometimes are really awkward around them..I come from a very criticizing family where they always thought it was okay to call me fat at the age of 4 and always yelled at me whenever I was hungry, I guess that's where the starvation thing cam from..I've also found relief in cutting and sometimes just want to kill myself and cut deeper even though I don't even have the bravery to do it. What I'm trying to say is..I'm a coward, a worthless coward and find no reason to live anymore, anyone wanna help me?
