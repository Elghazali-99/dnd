Hi, i'm 22 and currently 25 weeks pregnant with my second child. I left my boys' dad when i was 9 weeks pregnant as i finally realised it wasnt good for my nearly 3 year old son or the new baby, as our son was starting to fight his dad back when he got violent towards me, and the fact i was pregnant with his 2nd child didnt stop him either. I'v been living in a refuge miles away from him and my family since november and am really starting to get down about being a single mum to 2 boys who's father doesnt care about them. I grew up with an alcoholic dad myself so know more than enough about how neglect from parents can affect kids in later life and i'm really worried my unborn child will resent me, not so much my 3 year old as he remembers why we left and tells me alot how he's happy daddy doesnt live in 'this house' with us.
I've been to the doctors recently but keep getting told its just pregnancy hormones but i really dont think it is any more, is there anywhere i can go thatwill take me seriously and not just blame hormones!!? X
