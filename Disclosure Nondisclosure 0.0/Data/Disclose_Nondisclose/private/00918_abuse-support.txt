My ex was very abusive and left me totally traumatised. I found out that he also tried to murder his ex-wife when i finally got away from him. By the time i had recovered from PTSD, I reported his abuse to the police but it was too late for him to be arrested. It was also very hurtful that one or two mutual friends Only a year or so later, he is happily married to a lovely lady. I contacted her on facebook, assuming he would be abusive to her too. Only apparently he is lovely and kind and gentle to her. How can this be? how without any retribution or justice can he have just changed? 
 Also, people who didnt know me very well at the time, and didnt really want to believe he did all this, and his family, can now just say i was crazy and made it all up. I find it so hard to get over what he did to me (which included taking me captive for 4 days in his house, taking away my phone, attempting to strangle me, threatening me with a big knife when i said i wanted to go home and interrogating me about my ex-boyfriends using scientology techniques against my will). so no small thing to get over. I always thought one day he would abuse again, and then i would help that girl go to the police and there would be justice. But it isnt, he's just somehow changed and they're blissfully married. how can this be? i just dont believe in god or goodness anymore.
