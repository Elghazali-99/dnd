Hello,
I had an ultrasound a couple weeks ago on the inner side of my shine where I felt a lump.  I had an ultrasound  done which showed a small hypoechoic nodule which was 1 cm at its largest dimension which appeared solid in nature and nonvascular.  It also stated it was subcutaneous and superficial and all other findings were unspecific.  I had an mri done yesterday on the same leg and the radiologist was aware of the ultrasound.  The radiologist said everything was normal and that they could not find any abnormalities and specifically mentioned they could not see any nodule what so ever.  I have been told mri trumps everything for soft tissue.  I am wondering how an ultrasound would see a nodule but a mri wouldn't?  Regular doctor says the mri trumps everything and I can more or less ignore the ultrasound, but I am baffled as to why the ultrasound identified a nodule but the mri radiologist is saying there is no nodule even when they knew the ultrasound said there was one?  Can the ultrasonogropher have made a mistake?
 Thanks
