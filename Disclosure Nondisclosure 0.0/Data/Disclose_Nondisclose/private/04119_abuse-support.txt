My mother has been emotionally abusive since I was about 14 years old when she married her late husband. Since then I've gone through medical problems, a teenage pregnancy, and now trying to move out on my own. 
She controls every little thing that I do but has a way of convincing me that she doesn't control me, if that makes any sense. It's like she has mental control over me in the form of severe guilt. 
She constantly puts me down, calling me lazy, useless, and a bad mother. Then later, after our "argument" she will act as if nothing happened and if I bring up the abusive behavior she quickly becomes defensive and says things such as "you never understand anything."
Recently I've gotten a new boyfriend that is the sweetest man I've ever met. He's loving, caring, does right by my son, and treats her with respect. 
One of my friends got married the other day and we were talking about "what if's" about me getting married one day. She says "Well I certainly hope you don't marry (boyfriend)." When I asked her why she didn't really give me a direct answer. Yet another thing in my life she's trying to control.
Now I don't want to bring him around because she doesn't like him for seemingly no reason. How do I deal with this?
