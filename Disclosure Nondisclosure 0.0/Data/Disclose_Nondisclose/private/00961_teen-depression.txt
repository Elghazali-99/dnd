Hello I'm 16 years old and I'm just wondering if I'm depressed or not? and if I am how I should be going about getting help essencially I guess. 
 I've a hard time these past 3 to 4 years or so with coming to turms with my sexuality which I'm still not completly sure about because i know i like girls but I'm not sure about guys still. It's starting to really frustrate and hurt me especially when I see this one girl i've known since i was 6 and have come to turms with that i really like her and she is so obviously straight. My school closed down towards the end of my GCSE year so that was stressfull and my Nan passed away a couple of months ago. 
 I've been getting angry and frustrated easily this past year or so and tearful, but not crying, at the silliest things. I feel that I'm not good enough for anyone even though I talk to people at school and can luagh with them for 10 minutes I'm not very close with them and can tll that if i wasn't around they wouldn't wonder where i am or probably care. Some of my close friends don't seem to really care either. One of them always calls me a freak and to get a life because I'm a bit of a geek/nerd or whatever and she wants to be close to all the popular people, the others are just oblivious and seem to forget things i tell them e.g. i told them how i feel about the girl i like and they always talk about how this really kind popular guy likes her and tormenting me along with some guys in our year about which guy i will 'get with' they dont seem to notice how uncomfortable i get around that subject yet i have told them and it angers me!
 another thing i should mention is that i have self harmed before, it calms me when i'm angry or sad. it distracts me when i feel dwon and gives me a buzz when i've finished. though my parents found out and they obviously wanted to know whats wrong so i gave them a little bit of info to please them but i think there hoping for me to open up more. they were angry and upset that i had self harmed and said they would get angry if i did it again... i dont think they understand the concept of selfharming much but i havn't done it since then but it doesnt mean i stop thinking about it.
 I feel like I've let them down as a daughter, they deserve so much better than me because they are brilliant. I have what people would say a good life, i have a loving family and get to take part in all my hobbies. but this makes me feel so guilty. there are people out there in the world who have it way worse than me and yet i'm here for the past few years but mostly this year struggling with life, i know what i want to do as a career but i always dout ill ever be good enough for a job, course at university, friends, family and that one special person. I'm scared that I'll always been alone. I've never been kissed or anyone show that they really care for me and it makes me feel empty inside. Is it too much to ask for someone to care about you and show it to you at least once a week or so.
 I could go on but I've already seen I've written alot and thats an understatment. I just wnat to know if their is any point bringing up that i think i may have depression to my parents. i've looked at syptoms lists and seen that i have quite a lot of the symptoms but i dont know when oor not you realize that you are infact depressed. the symptoms below are ones that I've seen and believe i have. 
 - waking up early, having difficulty sleeping, or sleeping more (i can sleep over 12 hours and still wanna stay in bed)
- feeling tired and lacking energy; doing less and less (i dont exersise a lot and cant find the motivation to)
- putting on weight  (i baisically eat loads and dont feel full and have no motivation to stop)
- difficulty remembering things 
- feeling low-spirited for much of the time, every day 
- being unusually irritable or impatient 
- finding it hard to concentrate or make decisions 
- blaming yourself and feeling unnecessarily guilty about things 
- lacking self-confidence and self-esteem 
- being preoccupied with negative thoughts 
- feeling numb, empty and despairing 
- feeling helpless 
- distancing yourself from others; not asking for support (untill now..) 
- taking a bleak, pessimistic view of the future (not all of the time but quite often)
- self-harming (by cutting yourself, for example) 
- tearfulness
- lack of motivation  
- difficulty making decisions 
- feeling anxious or worried  
- Neglect of personal appearance 
 I've also done 3 of the online depression assesments and they say i have mild or moderate depression but to not take it as a diognosis which is why I'm here.
 If some kind person has taken the time to read this can can give me advice or if they are educated enough to see if i am or not them please let me know.
 Thank you so much and sorry for writing so much and taking up your time.
