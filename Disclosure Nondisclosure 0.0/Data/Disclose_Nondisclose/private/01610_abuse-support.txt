Well, My boyfriend and I have been together almost 1 year and yesterday he came over and we had the best day ever. We did have sex earlier that day and then later that night I stuck in back into my dorm room because it was after visitation hours. We were in bed watching movies and he got horny and he started kissing me and stuff and then he entered. This may be too much info but I think  I just recently got over a yeast infection so I'm still a little sore down there and  so it hurt a little when he enter. I told him to stop I was tired and it hurt and he kept going  for a few minutes but then he stop and pulled out. He sat there a while and started masturbating and roll over to sleep but then he got back on top of me and I asked him to please stop and everything but he didn't and then he was like he could go home and I didn't want him to leave i just wanted him to stop so I started crying and then he was like this will just be a few more minutes and he kept going and I kinda of just took it I didn't even fight I quit telling him to stop and I just laid there until he finished. I felt so violated and I just laid there and cried and he looked so guilty and he kept asking me was I mad at him, but I didn't know what to say. I finally just went to sleep and then today I didn't go to any classes. My head hurts and everything and I don't know if this is how I should feel right now. Like I love him and I am confused by this....
