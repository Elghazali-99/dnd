I have been feeling terrible for about 2 months. Severe anxiety, depression, etc. it's hard to get out of bed and I'm walking around in a fog. I'm totally disconnected from the world.  I just want to sleep, be left alone and try to go to work to support my family.  Got my blood results back from my GP and I have low testosterone (level of an 85 year old) and I'm 40, low Vitamin D and elevated Thyroid antibodies. My GP prescribed me Ambien to sleep and Lexapro.  The Ambien has been great but I am refusing to take the Lexapro until I have everything else ruled out.  I've been reading a lot about the connection between low testosterone, thyroid problems and depression.  I have an appointment with my Internist next week followed by a Thyroid specialist the next week.  Am I right to wait on the Lexapro? My brother in law takes it with great results but I just think it was a quick diagnosis.  Would love to hear your thoughts. I feel awful.  There hasn't been a day in the last three weeks I haven't cried in frustration.
