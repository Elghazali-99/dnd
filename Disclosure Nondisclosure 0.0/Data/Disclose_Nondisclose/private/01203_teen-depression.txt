I'm a 17 year old girl, last year my parents divorced (which usually wouldn't bother me as it's happened before) however, this time both parents left my family home leaving me with my older brother (now 21). My father was the first to leave and I spent weeks trying to cheer my mum up as she was diagnosed with depression and made the worst mistake of my life by dropping out of college, shortly after though, she was back with an old ex of hers who previously left her for another woman. Obviously, I don't like him so I tried to be as civil as possible and just warn him to not treat her like that again. My dad is also with a woman who does not like me because I used to get on with my Mum so well. Today, we're at the point where I'm living with my older brother and my boyfriend and my Dad has to see me in secret so to not make his girlfriend angry. Today, me and my boyfriend ended and my brother has chosen him over me and so I have nowhere to live, so I told my Mum this who told me that she made a deal with her boyfriend that I wasn't to move back to be with her under any circumstances otherwise he would leave, because of this she told me she doesn't want to see me again. I feel like everyone thinks I'm a moody teenager and I cannot see myself getting out of this situation or the way I'm feeling. During the past year, I have actually been diagnosed with depression too, but I still can't help feeling like it's my fault and maybe I am just a stroppy teenager. Help, anyone?
