I do not know if you would concider this stress or not... well, I think it is. I am a 26 year old male. I stress and worry about EVERYTHING it seems. First its my family, then its me dental issue (and thats simple, I had a root canal done and I am stressing and worrying that the crown is going to fall off and leave a gap in my teeth. I even had to go to the dentist to hear her say "DO not worry, everything is fine) my latest issue if my health. I do not talk to the first girl I slept with, about 7 years ago. And I reccently heard she using druggs a little bit here and there... and that SCARED me! I used protection with her, but like I said, I stress about it. I never get sick, never get the cold, I am actually really healthy. Well, I went down and got tested, blood tested, to make sure I was safe (STDs and what not) The tests came back, and I am fine... I was told I am healthy, no STDs. A year down the raod (last week) I started to worry about it AGAIN. I have been with the same girl for 4 years now, we are totally faithful, both of us have been tested, and both do not have anything. This reccent worrying of mine has caused me to have Panic Attacks, It seems I worry about things that I SHOULDNT... I want to know is there anything I can do?
