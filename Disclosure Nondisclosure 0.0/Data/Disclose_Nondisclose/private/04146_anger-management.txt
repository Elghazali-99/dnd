I am seeing a 46 year old male. He can be the softest sweetest person I no. Then he can get angry over the simplest thing and when he does he looses it. He has told me to get out of he house or he would call the police and have me removed or tell me never to step foot on his property. He shuts u out and won't talk or communicate with you for days at a time sometimes a week. He is a very hyper person never sits still and always has to have a project. Anything he does or you do for him can never be done fast enough. He is a neat freak and would say he has some OCD. He has very few friends and likes to stay to himself. Works from home and really doesn't like to go far from home unless he's traveling. Everything has to be what he wants and done his way. He can be kinda hearted but when it comes to money he can be selfish and cheep. I know he had a hard childhood. He had a nasty father and they no longer speak. Was raised by the mother and had very little to live on while the father was well off.
I would like to know what I could do to help him. One minute he is as happy as can be and then he turns. I don't know how to help him that he would except.
