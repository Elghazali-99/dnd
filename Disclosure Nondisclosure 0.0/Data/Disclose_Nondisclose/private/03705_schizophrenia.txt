This has been going on for 3-4 years now. My brother went through some stress while living alone abroad and developed schizophrenia. I think he was bullied there a lot. He thinks everyone is in conspiracy against him, including family members. He thinks he is being chased and followed all the time. He was much worse before, but now he "seems to be fine", he even got a job and outside for a stranger, he seems alright, just too serious, too introvert. But he still thinks we, family are on in too, that we betrayed him and asks us to admit the truth occasionally. He thinks he is supposed to achieve grandeur, become someone highly important and save the homeland or something. Of course, he refuses to get any treatment. He becomes violent when we mention medication. He says we want to declare him schizophrenic to get rid of him. Mom thinks he is getting better on his own, since he learnt to "play normal" outside, also at home he is ok most of the time. I am desperate for any help/advice. I think it is highly unlikely that he will get cured on its own, without any medication. But he knows to play healthy. What should we do? Is it okay to slip some medication in food/beverages?
