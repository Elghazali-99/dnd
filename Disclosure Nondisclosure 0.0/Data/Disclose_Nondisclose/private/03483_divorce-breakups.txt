So I was introduced to a coworker through another coworker. I know thats taboo but she has always had my eye. Long story short, we dated for 2 months and they were amazing. We were planning a future together. She wanted to fly me back east to meet her family an we discussed what our future would be like. Everything was going great until out of the blue, and ex of hers entered the picture. She told me of him and how abusive he was and that she was glad to be rid of him. Well a couple of weekd ago, I come home from work to find a Facebook message saying she is ending things with me to get back with him. I was infuriated that she would do this and more so that she wouldnt even say it to my face. I called her out on it and was told that she didnt owe me anything and that she could dump me as she chose. After a few days, she admitted she was wrong and agreed to meet me so we could talk about it, only to take it back the next day again by Facebook message. I posted on my page how hurt I was and that I felt betrayed and that I felt if she cared about em she wouldve at least met em and talked to me about it in person. she then told me the next day that she wouldve got back with me if I hadnt posted that, because she felt her privacy was violated, even though she posted similar things about me on her profile. As it stands now, she is with him and is set up to get hit and cheated on and controlled again. I guess my questions are...am I out of line for thinking she shouldve met me to end things and if her method is acceptable/respectful? And I do feel for her and feel she would be the perfect person to be with, so do I fight for her or is she not worth my time if she could do that to me?
