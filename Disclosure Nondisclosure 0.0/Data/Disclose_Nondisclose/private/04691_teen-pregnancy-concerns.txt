i js had a mild sex with my gf 2 months back .. on april 23..2014. fingering and all... bt for a while she removed her panties but i didnt .. n we were very close. but i didnt insert my penis inside her vagina. i suppose it was js touching beside it.(i had my underwear on) .. bt few days ago.. she vomited ... alot for a day.. kind of.. started in the evening.. and was vomitting .. the whole night. in the sense .. whatever she ate..she vomited at dat moment. bt d next day she was a bit fine. she suppose it was food poison n took home remedies for it. n she feels fine now. bt she had her periods for d month of may.. as well. as this month's too... lasted for 4-5 days.and she doesnt have any pain now.no headache.no weakness.she was feeling all this while vomiting.... and her tummy isint bulged out. the only thing is.. she has gained a bit of weight.bt not from the tummy part.whole body i would say. so is she pregnant? can you please help me?
 but could spotting or implantation bleeding occur during periods? i mean... is it possible? she might have mistaken it for periods? bt she had her periods of this month some 2-3 days late... compared to the previous one..
