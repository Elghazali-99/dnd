OK so I was in hospital over regaine the product gave me a bad reaction and I became depressed and suicidal so was hospitalized
 I was put on risperdal 4mg mirtazapine 30mg zopiclone 7.5mg
 Week 2 in hospital my penis shrivels up and is smaller
 Week 3 I'm out I go to GP over my penis he ignores me and gives me omeprazole 20mg as I had a bad gut to. The GP was intimidating and aggressive and not even say anything to my penis situation
 So I take 2 tablets of this omeprazole 4 days later I'm really I'll running around the place screaming my vision goes red and my eyes go out of place and black brain fog appears in my vision
 My family put me back on risperdal 4mg
 Weeks later my penis shrinks more and I develop RLS and Parkinson's movements with pure brutal headaches also out of it
 Weeks later I feel better but I'm mentally weird and barely have a penis left
 I go to my shrink and ask for ability
 I take abilify and my penis kicks back in with size and erections I'm thrilled with it
 A week later my heart hurts my bladder feels odd and my skin is peeling and burnim
