Hi, so long story short... I was raised in an emotionally abusive environment, now I'm in am emotionally abusive relationship. My fiance and father of my three children gets mad at me when were in an argument and calls me fat ugly a dumb ***** a **** you name it. But then can be super sweet sometimes. He's cheated multiple times, doesn't have a job or a license anymore... Yet I always go back to him. I work and am going to school for my nursing degree. I can be a ***** sometimes lol but honestly nothing outragous just get mad about normal stuff..  Whenever we fight (about 2x a week) no matter what he says to me or names he calls me I always take him back and sometimes even apologize to him when I've literally done nothing wrong. I always feel bad for him. Like right now, my mom bought a house and I'm doing a rent to own deal with her on the house. He treats me like **** and I want to kick him out yet I think to myself, he'll have no where to go no car or money then I feel bad and don't do it and now he's helped out a ton with this house I feel like that's another reason to feel guilty about kicking him out of there. When were together I feel lazy and don't take good care of myself when we are apart I loose weight and take much better care of me. I don't know what to do anymore but am so stock of being cut down and would hate myself if any of my kids got into a relationship like this yet I know it's possible given my relationship., when I said I grew up with an abusive enviorment I meant every other weekend I'd go to my dads and my step mom would get drunk and call me a stupid **** and such at like age 5-10 when she was drunk then the next day act like nothing happened and tell me if I told my mom I'd neve be able to see my dad again so I never told I just adapted until my dad caught on and left her.i need help and don't know where to turn ... Xx thanks for listening xX
