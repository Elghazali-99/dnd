I am happy to see some response there.  Emotional abuse is a great place to start: when someone makes you FEEL badly for no reason, this causes big holes in self-esteem, and an inability to see the self as a soul worth being in the world.  It causes depression, and that can lead to agoraphobia.  I cannot stress enough how important COUNSELING is for those who have these problems. 
Bullying was mentioned also.  This is just awful, and it does not only happen to children, as many people seem to think.  Bullying among children is something that every adult should correct, on the spot, with seriousness.  Childeren who bully should be taught that what they do is NOT acceptable behavior, and that it will not be tolerated.  Child victims of bullying must have others around them who praise them and let them lnow they are important and great to be around, loved, and cared for.  Otherwise, these young victims may grow up to take it out on their own spouses and/or children.  What a tragic downward spiral this can be.
Bullying among adults happen most often among friends and/or coworkers: clique-ish behavior that excludes one person, even to the point of one clique-member or more becoming outwardly rude and mean directly to the person being excluded.  The ones doing the bullying feel like better people than the victim.  That is sad and immature to the extreme.  The victim is upset, maybe scared, and turns inward in an attempt to make themselves less noticeable to those who harrass them.  Depression is likely, dramatic drop in self esteem, seeking of places of safety for themselves to the point of staying home, or even getting angry enough to confront the tormentors.  Never good.  What are your thoughts here?  Blessings - Blu
