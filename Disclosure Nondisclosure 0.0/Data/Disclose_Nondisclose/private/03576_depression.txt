I have been with bi polar since 19 , i am 59 now , my doctor would only use Depakote and Effexor , i suffered sucide attemp after suicide attemp , and the doctor never cganged the meds. I finilaly had enough and starte looking for a answer , I came up with Adderral for the sever depression , and when i felt suicidal 5 mg , 10 miniutes latter i was a diferent man . During the months of mania and mixed episodes i used Klonopin 3 1mg daily , and for 1 full year i went cycle free , no depresion no mania , but after 1 year the doctor had me see another doctor for a 2nd opioion , he agreeded , with 1 idea more to start me on Lithium right away, my doctor said no and in July 2012 took me off all meads , claming if i did not get well on Depakote i was not bi polar . On 10/10/12nt to my doctor in extreame mania complaining of a credit card spree i had started , and my feelings of sucide when i crashed fro this mania, i was told to leave . December 3 /12 i was addmited to the psy. ward , where they got me back on my meds , and now back t normal , how can a doctor put a patience of 17 years at rick of suicide to try and prove her point that i was not i polar.
