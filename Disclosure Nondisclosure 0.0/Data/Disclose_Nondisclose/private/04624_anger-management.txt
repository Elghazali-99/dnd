I just finished walking for two hours home from a trip to the home improvement store.  I shouldn't have needed to walk but after being screamed at in the car again today I asked to be let out.  Usually I'll walk away from my husband when he starts yelling at me, but in a car it's not a place I can get away.  He was angry that I asked to get out of course.  He kept yelling at me from the car.  I asked him to please go home and leave me alone because I don't want to be yelled at any more.  He told me he wouldn't yell, to please get  back in the car and when i said no he continued to yell.  He finally did let me be and let me walk.  I needed to walk.  I can not be yelled at every day any more.  Small disagreements turn into huge explosions.  Trying to have a conversation is like walking through a mine field.  I love my husband, I don't want it to be this way but I can't take any more.  
I had been advised before to walk away when he throws his tantrums and I do that often.  I just didn't know what to do in the car.  I want to run every time he starts any more.  Am I being melodramatic?  Am I crazy to think that I should have a conversation without being yelled at.  
I don't know what to do any more.  I am a stay at home mom, and think that I need to change that ASAP.  I fear leaving my kiddos at all though.  I am their protector from his wrath.  
I do feel argumentative with him any more, like I constantly have to stand up for myself. 
Any input would be welcomed, thanks.
