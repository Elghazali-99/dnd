3 years ago I had bad fever and had high ESR rate, the hematologist thought ER doc was silly for ordering ESR when I had fever and sinus infection (sinusitis) . I was checked for autoimmune disease, liver, kidney, diabetes, protein, cbc and had ct scan. All were normal. However my hematologist ordered  Serum Protein Electrophoresis and showed I had these results below. He said he was not concerned by result. I feel fine, no pain, etc..I am only 31. I stumbled on test results while cleaning and became obsessed with High result. After fever and infection was gone, my ESR returned to normal but I never tested for SPEP test again.
 Here are the readings Doctor:
 Serum Protein Electrophoresis

albumin 4.11 (2.37-4.57)
alpha 1 - 0.39 (0.24-0.56)
apha 2- 1.11 (0.54-1.13)
beta 1.07 (high) (0.52-0.98) increased beta fraction, no monoclonal or polyclonal gammopathy seen
gamma 1.31 (.055-1.57)
a/g ratio 1.1 (1.1-2.5)
monocional region 0.0
protein electroporesis interp. (no paraprotein detected)
  Immunofixation
Keppa free light chain 16.3 (0.33-19.4)
lambda fre lighr chain 13.4 (5.7-26.3)
kappa/lamba ratio 1.2 (0.3-1.7)
