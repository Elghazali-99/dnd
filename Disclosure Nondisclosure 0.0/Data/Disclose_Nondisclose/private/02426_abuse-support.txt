Okay, back in December I was in a rough place in my life, making many bad decisions. I attended a small get together where there was drinking and drug use. I was intoxicated but not enough to not remember things. I remember most of the night with a few blank spots inbetween. I remember as the night was winding down I got into bed with a friend and I remember he and I were making out and he was fingering me rather hard. I remember other friends walking into the room and quickly leaving upon realizing what was happening. Then I remember talking to him for a while after that then everything goes blank. I think because I fell asleep. But I'm not entirely sure. So the next morning I wake up still in his bed, him next to me asleep, in EXTREME abdominal area pain as well as vaginal burning and blood everywhere. I also had to pee so bad, that may be unrelated. Blood All over my legs and such. I cleaned up and left immediately. We never talked about the night again and soon after, the friend ship dissolved. 
 So about four months later a found myself in a loving relationship with a man who encourages me to be a better version if myself and choose to loose my virginity to him. So we have sex and there is no blood no pain nothing. He has good size down there so it's not that he just wasn't big enough. So no 'popped cherry' so to say. Which gets me to thinking what if that old friend really raped me and that's why there's no tell tale signs of loosing my virginity when I finally had sex. 
  I know this is long and I may have missed a part. Please ask any questions that will help answer my question. I just want to know if I was raped. If there is any way to tell physically that you were raped when you wake up the next morning? Thank you in advance
