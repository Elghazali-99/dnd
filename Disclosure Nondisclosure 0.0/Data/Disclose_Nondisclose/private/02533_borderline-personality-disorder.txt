Hi, I am a 27 year old sufferer of BPD.  I was diagnosed in early 2010.  Since i was diagnosed the phycologist sent me away to learn of this on my own.  He claimed there was no treatment and i had to just get on with life as in the future it could just go in time.  After trying to work this out, i felt for some months i had made tracks and achievements.  Only to be sat here 2 years later in a position where i feel worse than ever.  I have real problems with finances, sociol acceptence, motivation, holding down a job,along with many other things.  I dont want to live like this forever, but cant help but feel its just a constant circle, which you beat for a while only to be in a bigger circle, until eventually you have exhausted everything, and everyone around you.  I dont want to quit on life, i want to succeed, but i cant find any real help and motivation, im not sure what im left with.  I have piles of pages of stuff i have wrote myself, about bpd, ways of trying to get myself on track, diarys, daily moods ects.  ive now got to a point that i have had 2 strokes through drugs abuse,  i owe thousands upon thousands of pounds to different means of creditors, i have lost so many friends, family have give up on me and i cant go a day without not just telling lies, but loosing all respect for myself.  Realise i can somehow get out of it because i have time upon time before, but is it just gonna be this way forever? will i ever beat all this? is there a point in going through all this endless pain just to be back where i started? maybe it would help just talking about this to another person who understands, i dont have anyone to talk to who i trust any more because they no longer feel they can help me.  hope someone out there can talk to me.
