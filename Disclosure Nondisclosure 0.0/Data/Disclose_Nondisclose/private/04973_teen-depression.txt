hi im 16 yrs old and ive been dating my boyfriend for now 8 months . we've went threw so much i could write a whole story about it but long story short is he really likes to go off party getting messed up not call me turn his phone off and expect me to be there waiting for him.. hes went to stripp clubs on me which really hurt the most. a nurse at gateway told him he was a problem drinker... hes not an alcoholic they but i dont think so.. he is everything to me and all i try to do is help him in life and try to make a better life for him, and for our furture, he knows i care so much but when he hurts me or goes days without callin me or talkin to me i loss it when i see him.. youve got to understand wen we first started dating he said i was not aloud to talk to guys look at a guy not say hi to a guy . cant b friends with them on facebook i cant party drink smoke anything. but he would sit here and do it to me all the time. so after he would mess up after a couple months of so of him doing it over and over i started punchin him i dont try to beat him tho.. but its gotten worse , and im scared that i might hurt him really bad next time.. i threw his phone at his face and busted it cuz he went to the strip club and had a stripper txtin his phone n the whole time he tried to say he didnt know her but finaly at the end he tells me the truth. i already have problems of my own with depression but am i a bad person? do i need to seek help for this ? what does he need to do?
