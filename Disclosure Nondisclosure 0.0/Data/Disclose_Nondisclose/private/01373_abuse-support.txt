I was thinking about the phrase "thats in the past, just let it go" and considering that many of the things from my past are still very RIGHT NOW (example, debts that are still alive and well) .... It dawned on me that the person who does the abusing seems to be vary able and willing to "let it all be in the past" without having to suffer any consequence for their actions of course.
 While the victim is forced to live WITH the consequences day by day ... and its very hard to put something in the past when its in your face every day.
 For example, I was stupid enough to allow my ex wife to manipulate me into consolidating our student loans together so we could get a loan for a house. She also took out a credit card and neglected to tell me about it and did not pay our bills for nearly two years which ruined my good credit ... 
 So she runs off, leaves me with all the debt and the damaged credit while she is free and clear and has good credit and says to me "its in the past" I say "no, I STILL owe the money, my credit is STILL bad ... its not past its right now ... pay your share" she says "Well I have forgiven myself, so you just need to move on"
 It seems that abusive and manipulative people are very good at excusing themselves of genuine responsiblity and making monsters of their victims while they excuse their own behaviors...
