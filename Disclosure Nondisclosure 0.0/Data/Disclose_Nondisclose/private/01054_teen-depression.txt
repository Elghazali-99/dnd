I'm a 16 year old female. I'm a cutter (though I'm quitting), and don't hesitate to take more than the allotted dosage for pills even when I don't need them. I guess I'm another angsty teen.
 On another forum I asked for ways to get rid of bad stress.
Today I started shaking really bad and my heart was beating too hard and too fast and I wanted to throw up and I felt lightheaded and almost passed out.
 They said that's not stress, that's an anxiety attack.
They advised me to go to my parents.
I can't do that because my parents think that it's stupid. My brother was suicidal and he said something to them about it because he was depressed his girlfriend broke up with him. My mom suggested a therapist and my dad screamed "I DON'T NEED SOME DAMN SHRINK TO TELL ME WHAT I ALREADY ******* KNOW HE NEEDS TO MAN UP AND GET OVER IT!". I bet they'd think differently if he really suicided and they'd be upset. I know that they care for me and my brother they show it everyday. They just can't handle stuff like this. So parents are out.
I'm too young to seek out a doctor on my own, and I'm not entirely sure I have insurance at the moment.
One person told me to go to the school nurse and mention it.
I can't do this, because I am homeschooled. 
*Note: for anyone finding correlations between this behavior and homeschooling, this is the first year I've been homeschooled, the last 10 years of my education have been in public schools, and I really like being homeschooled*
School isn't a major stress factor. Just like everyone else, I'm gunning to graduate. It's a little stressful with the prospect of college looming nearer than it use to be, and life as an adult creeping up, but it's not what caused all this.
Unfortunately, I can't tell you what has caused this, though I know what it is.
So basically..I just need advice on what to do. I can't keep going on feeling like this everyday.
