I'm 32 and I'm in a relationship with a 54yo woman since almost a year ago. At the time I was living on my own. In the beginning we were seeing each other about 3-4 times a week, sex was great and we had a fair communication flow.
She eventually lost her house and had to move to an apartment she could barely afford with her ex husband alimony, so I figured I'd help her out by moving in since I have a full time job and I do well also with freelance gigs on the side.
 Suddenly everything changed. Sex wasn't anymore as great as before, but most of all I completely lost any personal time since she became very needy and requires my attention whenever I'm around, and if I don't give it to her without proper notice she will cry and complain in a rather dramatic way.
 Because of her behavior I got to the point that I have no time for freelance clients, I already lost one because she forced me to ignore my responsibility. 
 A few nights ago an unprecedented episode occurred: we were having a conversation and right in the middle of it she starts insisting that I accused her twice of checking up on me and questioning me about my facebook friends. I was completely taken aback and asked get when did I say that, and she looked at me and asked me of I was kidding, and she went on saying that I told her twice not even 10 mins prior!
 She was utterly convinced that I said something I never said. I'm not the jealous type so that would have been completely out of character.
 How do I deal with this situation? Unfortunately leaving is not an option at the moment as we signed a lease for a year and if I walk away it's gonna open a whole new can of worms.
