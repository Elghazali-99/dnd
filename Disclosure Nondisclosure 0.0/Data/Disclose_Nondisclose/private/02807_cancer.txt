I have had a very hard lump on the right side of my abdomen that I have noticed twice now. The first time was about a month ago, and I am not sure if it has been there this whole time, because I didn't think much about it at that time, and I can only feel it when I am laying down on my left side. The second time I noticed it was on the night of the 21st, and the lump has not moved or changed in size since that night. It starts right at the bottom edge of my rib cage, and about 1 inch in from my side, then it stops right when it gets to my belly button. It moves around easily, and it feels smooth not bumpy, but it is very hard, and is just smaller than the size of both of my fists put together side to side. I have had no pain, tenderness, or any kind of stomach upset or indigestion at all. I am female, only 23, and am 5'9" 120 pounds. I know there is only a very small chance of it actually being any kind of cancer, but I wasn't sure what other forum to post this in. I am on several medications, and I am wondering if one of those could be causing a problem. I take 300 MG of Wellbutrin XL, Loestrin 1.5/30 and 150 MG of Topamax. I started the Topamax last, about a year ago so I am wondering if it could have anything to do with that. I did lose 30 pounds when I started taking Wellbutrin in 2005, and then another 15 pounds when I started Topamax last year without trying. I have made a doctor's appointment for Friday the 29th, but I was just wondering if anyone had any ideas about what this might be so I could do a little more research before I go to the doctor. 
Thank you very much for your time, and any information you can give me.
