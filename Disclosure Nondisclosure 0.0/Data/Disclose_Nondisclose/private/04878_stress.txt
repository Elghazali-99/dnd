I have been so miserable the last few weeks. I have too much going on right now and everyone keeps telling me that's why I am not feeling well. My physical symptoms are that I haven't been eating at ALL, very little anyway, so of course weight loss, stomach aches, I can't sleep, like I'm up til about 3 every morning adn then I fell soooo tired in the morning but I can't sleep. Having crazy dreams and some heartburn although not bad. I am so tired and feel completely out of it and disconnected. I have been forgetful and getting confused, very achy. These symptoms are not mild, they are affecting me greatly. 
 Meanwhile I am getting married in two months and we lost our caterer and venue. We have been scrambling to find a new venue, attempt to get a refund, and reprint all new invitations. That is on top of me having difficulties with the business I sold (new owner not making payments) attempting a re-sell, financial struggles, me getting in a car accident that caused injuries and me to not have my car for a month while it was being repaired. I also caught my hair on fire with the BBQ and lost a good portion of it which was devastating. My fiance now started a new position with a new company and he is gone 12-20 hours a day. So I am dealing with ALL this and the wedding planning on my own. 
 I can see that all this stress can cause me to have trouble sleeping. I have had a really hard time eating though and some days I have to have bowel movements so frequently that I am not really able to leave the house much. Can all that including the stomach pain be from stress?
