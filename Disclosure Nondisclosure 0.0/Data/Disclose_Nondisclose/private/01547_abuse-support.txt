Hello, I'm hoping someone can answer a question for me. I have been addicted to vicodin for a couple of years and over the last 6 months have tried to wean by myself and quit unsuccessfully. I decided to get involved with a detox program covered by my insurance and started yesterday. The doctor gave me a prescription for Saboxone and I am supposed to take 4 mg, 3 times a day. Today has been my first full day of taking it. It has really been amazing in removing the physical symptoms I was experiencing BUT, I jumped on line today to see about how typical weaning goes for Saboxone and am now completely freaked out. I have read at least 50 peoples personal stories (or should I say nightmares) about trying to get off of Saboxone; almost every one of them saying that the withdrawals were way harder than the initial opiate that they started with. Every story I read however was about people who had been taking it as maintenance for over a year or more. So this is my question: Does anyone know how long it takes the body to become addicted to Saboxone? The reason that I am asking is this: I know that the physical dt's from opiate addiction typically take anywhere from 7 to 10 days to subside (or at least that's what I have read). If addiction to Saboxone is like opiates and takes the body several weeks to become dependent upon, then my plan is to use it for 10 days ONLY just to get me through the opiate detox. So essentially I will be detoxing from the vicodin while weaning myself from the Saboxone...does that make sense?
I really, really, really hope that someone out there knows the answer to my question because I just can't imagine ending up in an even worse place than where I started. :(
