My mum has been on anti depression pills for 17 years now. Her sister is a schizophrenic so it may run in the family although her parents are nice lovely people.
She is a selfish, manipulative person who cannot forgive anyone and can't accept that people have faults. My dad left her after years of her cheating and generally being horrible to him although she was the one to finish with him. She has had many boyfriends, most nice but she gets bored and throws them out after a while. In consequence she is lonely and doesn't have many friends.
I left home 3 years ago and since then she has claimed to have peri menopause which doctors have still not diagnosed. She has one drama after another and cannot think of other people just herself. Lately she blames everything on her anti-depressants and has lost her job through going sick so many times. She blames everyone else around her and cannot see what she's like.
I personally think, although this sounds harsh that all her problems are in her head I don't really think there's much wrong with her. It sounds harsh but I find it hard to have any sympathy for her as she is selfish and really hard work. But she is still my mum. Any advice?
