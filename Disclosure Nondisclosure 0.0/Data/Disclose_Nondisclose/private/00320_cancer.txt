Went to ER for what I thought was kidney pain. They did CT w/o contrast and it said no stones but it said left lung base demonstrates an area of nodularity noted with multiple tiny satellite nodules with some reticulonodular densities. Somewhat elongated, measuring at least 1.6 x 0.8 cm. Also notes in the left lower abdomen there is suggestion of some very hazy vague increased attenuation in the mesentery around loops of small bowel, not necessarily in the central mesentery but just lateral to some loops of small bowel, which is of unclear etiology. My symptoms are general malaise, nausea, overall body pain, daily migraines, frequent diarrhea, some chest pains, flank pain and right lower quadrant pain. I don't have fevers but am never comfortable temperature for last 6 months, always too cold or too hot and my symptoms keep getting worse rather than leveling off or getting better. Should I worry? Docs aren't worried but they're not having to live in the daily pain. Not great docs in my city. Thanks for any answers.
