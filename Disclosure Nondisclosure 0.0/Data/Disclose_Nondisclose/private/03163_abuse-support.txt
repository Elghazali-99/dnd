I am not really sure if  i should ask this question here but I guess there is no way to find out but to try. I wanted to know if there is anyone here who has been sexually abused in the past and is now currently married. What effects did it have on your marriage? Did you find it difficult to be intimate with your spouse? What are some of the emotions that you experienced?....If you think these are too personal then you dont have to answer. i am asking because i am currently doing a thesis on the impact of past sexual abuse on marital intimacy . If you do not feel comfortable answering openly please send me a message otherwise i understand. 
 P.S... i am also a survivor of abuse and it did affect my marriage really badly.....this is why i chose this topic because when i was  going through my situation i had no one to turn to or anyone who understood...I want to know if what i experienced was just unique to me or that there are general effects and also counsel other people on how to make things a better for both partners. 
 Thank you so much for your help
