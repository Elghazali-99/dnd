Hi, 
I am 48 and have not had my period for almost a year now. I have all those annoying symptoms like hot flashes, nightsweats, mood swings etc. But about 4 weeks ago I noticed my abdomen seemed very bloated or swollen. When it did not go down after about a week, I called my doctors office. They send me to internal medicine. He checked liver, kidneys... everything came back normal. However he scheduled me for a colonoscopy, which won't be for another 2 weeks. And I am driving myself crazy because I now also have a burning sensation in my abdomen. It's not painful, just very uncomfortable. Sometimes I wonder if maybe I just put on a few extra pounds around my mid section.
It really bothered me that this doctor did not once address my perimenopause, even though I mentioned it to him.
Long story short, he scared me to death with all this cancer talk and I feel like a sitting duck waiting for another 2 weeks for another test.
Has anyone else in here had those symptoms? Any reply would be appreciated.
Thank you
