My son, I've posted on her multiple times. He is 6 and has sensory processing d/o.  In the recent past his babysitter was turned into CPS and now has admitted to child abuse.  So she has a child abuse without injury charge pending, she goes to court in late December. Anyway, yesterday at the new babysitter ,my son started to say the NEW babysitter did all these things like throw him on the floor, etc and that he was going to call the police on her.  He was doing fairly well over there.  He said this mroning she pulled on his ear, he denies it, but he is very sensitive to people touching him (sensory issues, etc).  I am thinking about taking him to a therapist to talk to them about the old babysitter situation.  Do you think this is a good idea.
 She threw him on the floor when she got upset and thought he hurt her cat to make him feel like what it felt like to be thrown to the floor.  Then she made him sit down and she sprayed him with silly string and then she made the 10 year old spank him.  then she got her mom on speaker phone and had her yell at my son.  She had him make up a story that she was walking with him and they fell and he laughed.  He admitted to me that never happened and he did not laugh, he cried and that she told him to tell that story.   I reviewed with him that when someone tells you not to tell mommy something, it's a red flag and you need to tell mommy.
 He's upset with the current babysitter, he has to go back tomorrow.  But sometimes lately, he's been upset with friends one day and back to friends the next.  I don't know if this is a developmental stage or what.
 Also, at school, they hav ea time to share and he doesn't like to share what we have done together, etc (museums, parks, etc)-- he says it is his secret.  Is that unusual for a 6 year old?  
 I'm just concerned, thanks for any help anyone can offer!
