I am a 17 year old male currently a Junior in High School. I have a job a Burger King at the moment, I am so lost right now, my grades have "slipped" up really bad ever since freshmen year. I feel like I cant make it, I want to attend college and make something of myself but I dont feel like I have any help at all. I am living with my grandmother - 3 Years, I dont really know my father havent seen him since I was around the age of 5. My mom has chosen some bad decesions in her life, and isnt in my life anymore. I have spoken with my school councilor about a plan so I can go to college, and what I need to do, I have to retake 7! Classes Online, so I can have a good enough GPA to get in, I am also doing horrible at the moment in my Junior year. I am not dumb or stupid at all, its just I have had so much stress in my life the past couple years I cant see me having a bright future anymore. To add on to all of this my grandmother has been "hounding" me about money for my cellphone bill, insurance bill, I have to get a car soon, I owe her 350 dollars, she always tells me I need to learn how to get my **** together, and budget my small paycheck from Burger King. I just cant do it! I am extremely behind in my school, which I need to have caught up, I have bills to pay, I have a job, I have a really divided family, I have become non social with alot of  people. I dont really have alot of great friends in my life at the moment, I dont go anywhere, I just need someone(s). help to get me motivated. My new friend and hopefully girl friend has been through similar things, and tells me to just stay postive, but I just cant. She is the only thing that I am actually happy about. Shes a senior and will be leaving soon so I dont know what to do. My grandma is complaining about bills to me, behind in grades, family issues, I just dont know what to do anymore. Maybe somone here can give me some good advice, and help me out with some postive ideas. 
 Thanks.
