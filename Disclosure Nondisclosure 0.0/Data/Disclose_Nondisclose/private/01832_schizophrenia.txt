Hi I am a 19 year old male and lately I have been unable to get my mind off of the topic of schizophrenia.  I have a history of getting something in my head and being unable to stop thinking about it.  If it is a certain illness, I convince myself that I have it and look it up on the internet constantly.  I have been having this type of anxiety since I was younger and it started out with a fear of vomiting.  Once that passed, the next fear was one of death.  After that, i was worried that I may have brain cancer. And now, something put the thought of schizophrenia in my head and I cant seem to shake the idea that I am going to get this disorder.  I look it up on the internet all the time and constantly think about it.  I know these fears are irrational and yet I cant stop thinking that these horrible things are going to happen to me. I dont know if I am actually at risk of getting schizophrenia or if it is all in my head. please help me put my mind to rest so I can move on and stop having these rediculous thoughts. Thank you and I look forward to your feedback.
