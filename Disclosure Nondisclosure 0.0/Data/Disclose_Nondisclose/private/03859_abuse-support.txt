I dunno where to start..here it goes. My gf and i have been living together for about 3 and a half yrs, been together for four yrs. a yr after we were together she let out and told me she was sexually abused by her dad from the ages of 8-18. i believe rape occourred between ages of 8-10. her mom and dad were divorced when she was 8. my gf ended up staying with her dad. i met her when she was 19 i was 22. she has always been insecure in our relationship and worrys so much. im sad to say We both have cheated in our relationship. we tried to work things out but she still argues about the past. When we became pregnant we were excited i figured when she has her first baby all the arguin will stop. but it hasnt it has gotten worst. Ive come to a point where it comes to mind "what if she needs help?" should i get a counsler. i really want this to work out but all these fights are putting a serious dent in the relationship.Im 25 and shes 23. Would all this thats going on go back to when she was sexually abused? i have tried for her to want a counsler, she refuses. i have talked to her to let it out, she refuses becuase of her grandparents their about 70 some. I dont know who to go to all help is appriciated. thank you
