We were arguing well all day  and I told him not to eat my food since he wants to always take away What's his like when. He's mad he's like gibe me the car keys give me this I pay for it. So since I cook I told him don't eat my food I went to take his plate and he punched me in the arm in front of my 1 year old. I looked at him like what did u do that so he started screaming and my 2 year old came out the room as I hit my bf back he starts screaming and I told him not in front of the kids. I turned to walk away and he punched me in the face while my back was turned. and aggressively shook me and started cussing at me. I put my kids in the room so they wouldn't see all this and turned the tv volume up. As I'm fixing the tv for my kids he says come out so u can get it. I'm like you're real tough huh.  Given I'm 28 weeks pregnant and just yesterday I was released from the hospital for preterm labor.  I'm so scared and sad for my kids to have seen all this especially my 2 year old he always screams when me and his dad argue he understands everything.  I need help to get away I know it's up to me but the first step is always the hardest
