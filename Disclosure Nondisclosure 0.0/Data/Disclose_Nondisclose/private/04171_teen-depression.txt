When I started highschool everything was great, I go to a magnet school so I meet people from different places. Me and my friend said we were gonna have eachother back and we met this girl who we thought was cool so we hangout with her. 3 months later me and my friend,boy, started arguing and this girl somehow got into it. after a week everything is fine. Ever since i started highschool i been feeling depression and being lonely. I sometimes cry myself to sleep thinking about what if my family member died . Well recently me and my boy got into a argument and the girl she been transfered but anyways we are arguing and i dont know whats going on were just fighting over stupid stuff. but a month ago ive been feeling depressed alot more and then everything turned out fine . I started interacting with all of my friends alot more now and this problem just came up and i dont know what to do. I'm not suicidal or anything like that i dont cut myself but i do think what if i kill myself sometimes... i feel that im unwanted in this world and if i come apart of it i screw everything up for everybody.
