Two items occurred at one time, am not sure which is causing my depression.  I was able to stop my Zoloft after ten years, and wound up feeling terrific!  But then, a couple months later, I was put on an endocrinology medicine for adrenal issues, Hydrocortisone, and wound up slowly but surely falling into the worst depression of my life.  I was in a bad car wreck years ago, this made me depressed.  When my current psych found out I quit Zoloft, she almost let me go, so I kept it hidden from her, as I also take a tranquilizer for panic disorder and am afraid waiting for a new doc (might go to a free clinic becuz am disabled), would jeopardize that med.  Also, when I called my endocrinologists for help, they actually REFUSED to help me with this.  So, please, just a few quick words from some of you all would be SO helpful, I don't have much time, only a half-hour today!  I know, I can return tomorrow.  But still..  Should I (a) go back on Zoloft even tho I've been off for six months, or (b) wait to see the free clinic psychs and see what they will do, or (c) find a new endocrinology group?  WHAT SHOULD I DO?  I am inclined to slowly go back on the Zoloft, I have plenty at the house.  Do you think it would at least help a little?  I cannot stop the Hydrocortisone because since my adrenals don't put anything out, I could die if I went off it.  HELP!
