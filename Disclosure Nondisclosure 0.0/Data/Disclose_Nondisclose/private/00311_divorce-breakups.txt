My husband and I are in the middle of a divorce. He filed and moved out. The divorce has been really nasty. He says he loves me and wants to be with me, but he's not willing to stop the divorce so we can take time to work on our marriage, he wants to go to counseling while the divorce is in place, and he says if he sees progress in marriage counseling, he might consider stopping the divorce. I have been so angry because I feel like he's holding it over my head. He completely avoids me, we don't talk to each other and the only time we see each other is when we are picking up or dropping off the kids at each other's house, but one of the issues he wants me to work on in this marriage is trust. I feel like he's seeing someone else, and when I ask him, he says no, and tells me that I never trusted him our entire relationship, why would I trust what he's saying now! He tells me, I love you and want to be with you and I'm not cheating on you, but his actions tell me something differently! He told me the other day to get all the issues with the divorce situated now, so we can take the next 4 months and work on our realationship. Our divorce will be finalized in 4 months, that's why he says 4 months! No matter what he says to me, I feel in my heart that he has no intention of stopping the divorce! I have been so hurt, angry and depressed these last couple months, that earlier this week, I told him that I can't do it anymore, I can't try to save our 13 year relationship in 4 months, and not to mention that our divorce has been very ugly, we've been fighting about everything! It hurts, but I feel like I have to walk away and give him the divorce, and stop holding on, because I feel like he's let go, and I need to do the same.
