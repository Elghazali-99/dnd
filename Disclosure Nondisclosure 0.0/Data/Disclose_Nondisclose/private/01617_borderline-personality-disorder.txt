Hello all 
i just came across this site and wish to post a comment ,
 i was diagnosed with eupd a few years back and was prescribed diazipan which i instantly had suicide attempts then when i was admitted into a mental health hospital i was prescribed ,chlorohydropoxide for detox reasons then olanapine which i had to stop straight away as it made my suicidal thoughts a lot worse , so then i was put onto quetiapine 100mg 3 times a day the first time i took the dose after 5 minutes my legs went like a baby giraffes this is the only way i explain it, i have tried lowering my dose on my own as after i was discharged homeless from the hospital i had nowhere to go, now after 2 years of taking it my dose has been  put down to 75 mg twice a day , im wondering if this is the right medication as my moods and thoughts are driving me craxzy i cant get the proper help last dr i saw a dr murphy at the kingston wellbeing place he told me that it cant be treated and i should read a book called treading on eggshells i walked out can anyone offer me some advice on what i should do im almost 38 years old and im at my wits end as im still homeless
