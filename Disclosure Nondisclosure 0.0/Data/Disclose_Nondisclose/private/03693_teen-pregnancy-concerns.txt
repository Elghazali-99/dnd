In general, what are the regulations for receiving a IUD? 
Do you have to have already had at least one child?
What is the best recommended or safest IUD?
What is the youngest age you can receive an IUD?
 Information that might help:
I turn 18 soon and I would like to get an IUD, mainly because I have a terrible fear of child birth and my mother has a copper one that she says last for 10 years and doesn't really give her problems. I was also there with her a year ago when she had it replaced. The thing is I've read that you have to be sexually active with at least one person and you have to have already had a child, but I don't know if that's true and I can't seem to find any real helpful advice online. Also, my fiance is in the military and I'd feel more comfortable if when I get one, he's there with me like i was for my mother, the only issue is he only gets certain holidays off to travel, so I was wondering if it's possible to get one at 17?
 Any other advice concerning IUD's is welcomed as well, thank you.
