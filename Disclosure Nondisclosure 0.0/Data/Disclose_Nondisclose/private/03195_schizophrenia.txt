Hi all, and happy new year.
 Let me start by saying that my fiance has experienced some form or other of depression since she was a little girl.  In recent years, she has been seeing things in her head and now, at 25 years old, in the last few months, it has been worse than before.  She explains to me that she sees "Goblins", two of them, sat inside her head telling her negative things about herself.  The level of detail she goes into when describing them and their actions leads me to believe that she really does see them.
 I have been trying to encourage her to go and see the doctor recently to discuss what she is experiencing and to hopefully get some help with it.  However, she is scared to go as she fears the doctor will take her and lock her in a hospital.  I am lead to believe from reading around the web (and a certain degree of common sense) that doctors will only do this if they believe that you are a danger to yourself or others, but I am finding it hard to convince my other half of this.  
 I can say, after knowing her for 2 and a half years, that she is in no way a danger to herself or anyone else.  Anyone other than myself wouldn't even know there was anything wrong with her.  
 So what I'd like to know, and to get some degree of reassurance, is what exactly to expect if she were to go to see the doctor for potential Schizophrenia or Depression.  What treatments are offered and will the doctor take one look at her and suggest the hospital?  
 Thank you 
 Stuart
