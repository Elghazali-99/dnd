Looking for some insight here… I don’t know what else to do… I met a girl on the Internet and we connected immediately. I’ll ask my question first and then give the background. I’m asking is it physically possible under extreme stress and an intestine problem to gain about 2 pounds everyday for over 2 months? Almost 150 pounds? 
 Once we did meet she was around 150 pounds larger than she was when we first started talking only a few months prior on the Internet. If stress did truly cause her medical problem I am happy to work through it with her. But if she is lying, I would feel very hurt and like I could not trust other things about her. Sometimes she does give me the feeling that she is not 100% honest on what is going on with her weight/medical problems. 
 I know… I know… This seems like the same old story about how the person you meet on the Internet is not who they portrayed themselves to be. But she has quite the elaborate story on her stress along with intestine problem led to her very rapid weight gain. I want to believe her so much. So what I’m just really wanting to know, is it medically and physically possible, ever in history, can someone gain 150 pounds in just over 2 months? If this has ever happened before, I think I will believe her… 
 I can’t find anything on the Internet about this. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.
