So, before I get to the actual question, I'm gonna write a little about me and my life up until now...
First of all - I'm Norwegian, please excuse my English.
 I've never actually done this before,  wrote anything about... well, me, online like this. So, this is a first. 
I'm 18 years old, and my life has been , and still is, a complete, utter mess. I've been bullied ever since I first started school at age 6, both by students and teachers, so I've switched schools a lot. If I decide to continue studies again now, it'll be my tenth attempt at starting over at a new school.
I've been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder, severe depression, ADHD, anxiety, polycystic ovary syndrome and I also have an undiagnosed sleep disorder currently being monitored by a psychiatric nurse. And, on top of all this... my father is emotionally abusing me. I think. Which is my question for anyone who wants to answer.
 My dad had a rough childhood, his father died when my dad was only 13 years old, and his mother suffered from mental illness. He was taking care of himself and his sick mother, with no help whatsoever from his older siblings, and at the same time he was being bullied and beat up in school. I think he's a very insecure man, and that he takes this out on me. Name-calling, violent anger and blame - he takes it all out on me. 
I help out around the house, doing laundry, making dinner, walking the dogs, cleaning, cleaning, cleaning all the time. But he still finds it in him to call me lazy, hopeless and inept. My sleeping disorder annoys the living hell out of him, as we work together and I have to get up at 6:00AM every morning because he has this weird thing for arriving one hour earlier than we have to so he can sit on his ***, drink coffee and smoke while he reads the newspaper online. I usually black out at around 4:00AM, so I get about 2 hours of sleep. If I sleep for more than 2 hours, I'm literally not functioning, but I have some trouble getting up and out of bed in the morning, which messes up his routine. Every morning we have a big fight in the car on our way to work, and he tells me how inept I am, how lazy I am and will often tell me that I'm an immature, ungrateful brat and that I should get my lazy, fat *** out and find a new job because he's so ******* tired of dealing with my ********. 
He loves to give me nicknames and thinks he's being hilarious, when really all he does is hurt my feelings. He'll tease me and tell me that I look like one of the characters from a TV show here in Norway called "Tangerudbakken" which is a reality show that follow the lives of people with down syndrome. 
Apparently, I'm also stupid because I'm having trouble housbreaking my new puppy. 
Today he told me that if my puppy doesn't get housebroken in a matter of days, I either have to get rid of it or I'll have to find a new job and "get the hell out", meaning that he doesn't want me to live at home anymore. This would be completely fine with me, if it wasn't for the fact that I have severe despression and social anxiety, and can't even leave the house alone, which makes me feel even more insecure and pathetic. 
I have also been cutting, and he loves to bring it up after he's been yelling at me and calling me names, proceeding to tell me to "go home, cut yourself and act like an ape". Yelling is one of his favorite weapons against me, so are comments about my weight, my inability to get up in the morning and making fun of my cutting. I've never been one of those "look at my cuts, look at how awful my life is! I hate myself so much I have to cut #cut4bieber" - quite the opposite. I've been cutting since I was 11 years old and it's never been something to show off or tell everyone about, it's actually made me feel even more insecure and pathetic, but I still do it. It just helps me cope, I guess. But my dad thinks this makes me "an ape" or "a monkey". He didn't think so when I almost slit my, with mere millimeters to spare the blood vessels, though. 
 My mom has been telling him to leave me alone, which resulted in him apologizing to me, only to then say he was "joking". I don't think his jokes are funny at all, they're cruel and mean, and they make me feel even worse about myself and I don't have a very good self-esteem to begin with. If I do tell my mom what he's been saying both straight to my face and behind my back (he talks about me to my younger sisters, who then tell me what he's been saying and, most of the time, agrees with him), he'll call me a snitch and a "******* brat" or he'll just tell me to "take my ******* dog for a long walk and pack my **** up when I get back". I don't know what to do anymore, I just feel so helpless. He's my dad and all, but... I feel like he hates me. And if this doesn't end soon, I don't know what I'll do.
 I'm not sure if this is actually emotional and/or mental abuse, what do you think? What do I do about it?
