Hi.... this might be a very long story..
I always fight with people and I act very defensive !
my parents keep saying that I used to fight with me for the silliest reason
...I know their right...I am oversensitive and I kind of imagine peple attackong me with their questions
I've caused a lot of trouble for a very long time every now and then I fight with my parents espicially my mom
I feel that there is sth wrong with me .... I disrepect my parents   a loot...since i was a kidd.....
and HONESTLY I HATE myself... i look so sweet to people,teachers,and friends but sadly I have always been the moat violent and argumentative person in my family... Ive hurt my mom a loot 
I hate my personality ...I hate being spontaneous bcz when you are honest you get into a lot of trouble :S
I HATE BEING ME I FEEL boyish ... disrespectful ...and bizzarrre even when i look perfect from the outside... I sometomes hate someone bcz i just feel that they're not ..i dnt know... good ?  I constanyly fight with my mom and talkalooooot ....this is bcz my mom used to have cancer but she she recovered 3 yrs ago and know ahes ok but i started talkong to her all the time ahen we discivered that she had cancer when i was 13 ...so know 3 yrs later i continus to talk that way...it bacame a HABIT...sometimes we fight a loot so suddenly i start shouting and crying and i say vsry men things to her and my awful sister comments on everything ...when ae fight i say mean things to her so my mom replies by saying Im not normal.and that i need therapy she alsonsays that ill end up a s a lonely woman with none bexause she says if ppl knew the real me theywill  hate meand she only accepts me and forgives me bcz im gedaughter...replies
