I have had depression for at least 3 years now. I recently got out of depression ward at hospital after I told my guidance counsellor I was going to suicide. I'm now on Prozac and see therapists regularly. The thing is nothing has changed. I've come to realize no matter what pills they give me and no matter who talks to me, nothing will help me and no one will ever understand. I am super smart at everything and its not like anything in my life is super bad. My family doesn't eat along but that's not like something that you should commit suicide over. The thing is my intelligenc has lead me to suicide. Simple as that. Just over thinking everything. I really don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. I've told my whole family, doctors. What's it done? Nothing. I had some hope that some pill would magically turn things around, but nope, it would be too good to be true. Why continue when there is not one ape of happiness anywhere and all I get is suffering and emptiness? And no, I'm not just going to wait for things to gt better, they don't just 'get better'. I would be surprised if any person bothered answering me.
