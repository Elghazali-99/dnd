Can someone help me please? I have seen a doctor, got on some anti-depressants and plan to see a counselor. But I feel like I'm going crazy and cant get my life back.
 I've always been a bit OCD, with some things I have to do correctly or re-do. I've had bouts of depression, but never like this. One bout was several years ago when I became an extreme hypochondriac for several months and was always scared. I was able to get out of that. 
 Recently my depression has been worse since the winter. It was already getting bad, but an event made it much worse several months ago I was not thinking, I was out drinking. Having a conversation with someone and we were talking about lots of things. I was drunk and can't remember much of it, but it came up that while im not attracted to other men, ive often been curious about giving a **. Well, the other guy said he felt the same way and I could try it out. So I did. About a minute after starting, I stopped and left. I think it was a minute, maybe two. But I got grossed out. It wasn't for me at all. I snapped out of it and realized what I was doing. 
 I'm happily married. My wife and kids are my life. They are my everything.
Now I feel so bad. The thought has been on my mind constantly since this event. I'm embarrassed, ashamed, and disgusted. I have quit drinking, gone to confession and vowed to amend my life.
 I live in constant sadness. My depression is getting dangerous. And I think of family events, like being santa at Christmas, I feel like I am losing all of those things.
 I never even thought about it. I was drinking. I was simply doing it out of drunk curiosity. Can't believe I was capable of such a thing.
 I can't tell my wife. I just can't. 
 Now I can't sleep, Im never hungry, eating is a chore and I'm constantly distracted by sadness. This has deepened my depression to a point where  I feel like I can't go on. 
 Any advise on dealing with this? Help me!
