Anyone out there ever experienced  extreme emotional abuse to the point where , you actually question , do I deserve this or am I causing these people to hurt me in my life , ... to make things a bit clearer I was with a very emotionally abusive  man for many years  16yrs .. and he checked out but not really,  says terrible things to me ,  he says he has moved on that he hates me the thing is i did nothing to deserve the extreme hate he is my legal husband but I don't think of him as a husband because he never was[supportive or financially supportive in any way
So do I cause this kind of chaos in my life because ,something to me is better then nothing ? my self esteem was damaged  yrs ago .. I am a trauma survivor, I was sexually abused by my grandfather when I was 4 years old , my dad was an abusive man , well he never cared about me on any level , really , and my mom left when I was a kid , but did return to my life as i got older , I am now happy to have her and she is a testament that people can change..
I have always been in abusive relationships but this was I thought was my last I did everything to make him happy I thought now I am trying to learn to live alone at 49 and I am having a hard time, I don't want to let someone treat me so badly , we have 1 life and  I think I deserve to live in healthy from now on , but how do I do that ?
