hi all
 its me again after an year.
Life has changed so much..
I will perhaps be divorced in a couple of months.I did not contest it.he will get an ex-parte.Good for me that I will be out of it.Just called him an year after the previous week to know what the status of the divorce was.he was cold even though I spoke very politely.He was so shameless as to tell me that I am contacting him after such a long time for the divorce.I told him that he had contested and filed all false things against me which I was not in a frame of mind to contest back neither do have the money to do it.I let him know again that I was ok with a divorce and he did not have to contest it.In then end wished him luck and said all the best.Finally he just said 'yoo too'.
I was filled with hatred as to why did I have to call him again but I felt life is short and I need to get over all this.Someday he will realize what a dirty pig he has been to me.
 I feel terribly sad though after speaking to him.Really sad.
