Hi guys!
 I done something very silly and regrettable. I smoked tobacco through a friends bong out of curiosity. It was out of a real bong, not a homemade one. I could taste something very very strange, it was plasticy taste and smell. Someone even asked what was burning so It wasn't normal!
 I've understood for ages now that burning plastic can release carcinogenic fumes. Without doubt I've had something in my lungs, now I am very worried about the risk of this leading so cancer. I have a family history of cancer, although these have always been different types. Is this short-term exposure  enough? Is there any academic research to the level of exposure and risk of cancer? I empties the burnt tobacco and it smelt wrong! My friend who owns the bong also said something wasn't right. At some point I noticed I had a slightly blood shot eye in one corner, kind of like a burst blood vessel? 
 I know you guys get a lot of people with anxiety and paranoia so just to thank you guys in advance
