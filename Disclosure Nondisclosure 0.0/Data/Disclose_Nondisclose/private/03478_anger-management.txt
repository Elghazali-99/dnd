I am about to hit my 18th wedding anniversary and am embarrassed to say that I've lived with this since before our wedding.  The cycle of abuse is insane but because I love him, we have 4 kids together, and outside of his rage, he is a kind, helpful, loyal man who truly loves his family.  Also because of this, I have refused to call it what it is - abuse - until now.  I allowed him to convince me that I shared part of the responsibility for making him so out of control angry and would put up my wall just to endure the screaming, name calling, demands, and threats.  Also, I am a cheerful, outgoing person with lots of friends and family and told very few people about what went on behind closed doors and even then, minimized the truth in order to preserve his reputation.  It is such a lonely and frightening place to be in for so long when no one you know has a clue and my spouse acts like it's not really a big deal and it's all my fault anyways.  I had a complete emotional break down a few days ago after another assault and realized that I can no longer live like this.  I love him and always will but am finally finding my voice and researching how to set appropriate boundaries.  If he wants to avoid separation or divorce, he MUST see a doctor about anxiety or depression meds.  He MUST schedule marriage counseling immediately and be willing to truly admit to the full extent of his behavior without placing blame on someone else.  He MUST allow someone outside of our family to hold him accountable.  And, he MUST NOT ever take another drink of alcohol in our home ever again.  I welcome feedback on this.
