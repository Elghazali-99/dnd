For the past one year i am taking the tablet Sizodon 3 mg, i was admitted in Psychiatry hospital one year back. Because When i was working in office i got a call from my Mom just as usual daily call from Mom. At that time i was in depressed state and I thought that my friend's father only insisted my Mom to make call to me for testing whether i am giving importance to family or work, so i left the office and started to go to my home (Native place which is located 150 KM distance from my office). During the  travel i got call from my sister at that time also i thought it was to test me and my call is tracking by my friend father(i assumed).i reached the home at late night 11PM. i slept in home and wake up in the early morning 5 AM and started to office. My parents insisted me to stay back in home itself but i denied. During the travel in Bus, imaginary people(my friend father) convincing me like i made a mistake. I reached the Chennai (office) at 10 AM but i did not go to office again i started to go back to my Home (4 hours travel for office to home) finally i reached Home safely. During travel i called my father and asked to pick up from Bus stand. My parents were feared and asked me to take rest in home. Mean while my college friends called me and came to my home, my mother started crying and reported about me with my friends. I shouted at my friends like they came here to test me. I am started to think hidden cameras are placed in my home to watch me.They admitted me in Hospital. Above mentioned scenario lasted for me over 2 weeks only. Later i realised that no one conspired me and it was my false belief.  Now i am completely normal. 
Can you please tell me what was the problem for me ? What kind of disorder is this ?
Now is it advisable to stop taking  tablets or How long i should take the tablets ?
What are the side effects of Sizodon tablet ?
