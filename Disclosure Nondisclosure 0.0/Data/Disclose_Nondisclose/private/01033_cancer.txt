So I just had lunch, rested a bit, hidratei me and was excited to leave home again walk after so much time avoiding physical activities. But I could still feel my heart racing. But I thought it was just not going to give that ball, I was walking and the heart rhythm started to get worse until the point where I have to sit on the sidewalk so tired. I was a resting time and then came home as if I had run a lot and with a sort of tired feeling in the heart. As a widespread electrical discharge but was not in a determined point of the chest. My mother was scared that I could not even get halfway through and had to go home. My blood pressure had increased obviously, and my pressure gauge detected arrhythmia that time. The beats were very accelerated to over 130 bpm. So I had no choice. I took 10 mg of Inderal at the time and was lying on the floor waiting to pass, but it took 10 mg of Inderal to take effect in this state. When I went to shower, had dinner and still very tired lay on the couch. Slept great the other day I woke up later than usual. The days passed and increasing fatigue. I started to pick up the habit of eating something afternoon between lunch and dinner, and something in the morning between breakfast and lunch. I will not say that my hunger has increased in that time, since there were already some time that my hunger had increased drastically, and spent a bit to eat a lot of food even. But until then never got fat. But the rise of food during the day did not solve much in lack of energy and I still felt this lack. Soon another symptom, which was the headquarters began to emerge. Although I always take water greatly increased my thirst. The point I make about 4 cups filled with water at once and not indulge, her mouth was dry. I thought 10mg of Inderal were sufficient to cause this symptom and not given importance. The thirst increased and stabilized after a certain time, the amount of water per day did not increase, but some days came down out of nowhere, and all my days were equal. I realized immediately that I had just taken water I felt an uncontrollable urge to urinate, and the amount of urine per day increased. It would be possible to fill four bottles of urine per day. 
The fatigue did not pass, I felt hungry. But to start eating, depending on what I ate mainly corn, sweet potato, ketchup and sauces. I was much worse. My energy lowered as if someone had pressed a button and I was very wrong. There was a day I ate polenta with tomato sauce. That day I was very very bad, and I got to feel faint, but did not faint, but felt nauseous and my heart raced. I was thirsty. Nobody knew what was happening to me, my family members were scared. When that day passed I began to have diarrhea, but not often. Adverse reactions seen in the Inderal and it was written that could cause diarrhea, and as the sample exam parasite gave nothing I stayed quiet and waited improve. The diarrhea may be a symptom that is not part of the picture because it was not constant. She went back and forth, so I thought it must be some virus that my body was fighting. A while later despite my not be 100% energy it has stabilized a bit and I started to get bored staying at home resting. Wanted to practice a bit of sport. I played a little football that day, and I was most of the time in table tennis, although I was a bit tired still I wanted to get out of boredom, maybe it was boredom that was making me tired. But when I was coming home felt another symptom, the legs were tingling as if I had been too long without movement in the region and could barely walk to go home, many felt cramps and even a bit of pain. Already arms had not felt anything different about them. Over the weekend my blood pressure went up a while after I lunched, rose to 14 by 9 and I was very bad. Her heart was racing and sometimes beat out of rhythm, as my machine pressure gauge caught several times I felt this arrhythmia because it has a sensor that measures the presence of irregular rhythms. I was very tb lack of energy that was worse for a strong feeling faint, my father left me lying to not pass out and called to my doctor who did not meet as should be busy. On this day at lunch I had eaten a larger amount of fruits than normal. Ate two fruits, banana and melon. Thought about going to the ER but we knew what they were doing, look at my face as if I were to give a diagnosis, give sorinho and watch me sick. I ended up falling asleep and slept all afternoon (which I had slept right through the night). I was waking up was already dusk and was very lack of energy, no energy to take a shower until, again showered sitting. Sunday I spent more or less, and on Monday made ​​an appointment with a doctor of my old confidence, he said all that was happening, we more or less a long history, and he was startled by my blood pressure 14 9 asked for some hormonal tests to justify the picture, complete blood count (again without glucose), called for a total abdominal ultrasound was normal and asked that the TSH test again gave a little further down remains high for cardiologists and ordered to change his trust. Then in the same week when I woke up one day felt the throat shave too much water and dripped from the nose, had a low fever that was going to come back. (Detail:. Fever do not know if it was the flu because I got only measure when I felt she was not measuring at all the symptoms that I developed) Cardiologists confidence from my old doctor were full and could only meet me at the end of this month. Then scored with another cardiologist who could the same day. The cardiologist asked what was happening and again we all had been happening, and he again asked if I used drugs, and I swear I have not used anything before or since, not ever. He did not seem to have much confidence in me. But he said it could be some extracardiac problem or faulty electrical circuit in my heart. He asked me the following exams: 
-> Ergométrio (I still do) 
-> Ultrasound of the Thyroid (I still do) 
-> X-Ray Chest (Deu normal heart at normal size, but with a small detour column) 
-> 24 hour Holter in his clinic (The overall result of this examination is at the beginning of my report, if need detailed examination I sure will provide.)
