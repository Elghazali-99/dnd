My friend is showing some strange signs I'm really worried. She is 15 and she has lost interest with most thing she has enjoyed doing she is really paranoid she delays her hygene she can't be bothered to shower she only showers when she's going somewhere important she neglects herself alot. She has suicidal thoughts and she plans her suicide aswell. She always closes the curtains for some reason :s she moves her mouth and toungue in a odd way she laughs for no reason she gets angry and upset for no reason she can't understand simple things she always feels like people are out to get her and that people know about her. 
 She thinks if she touches something dirty she'll get AIDS she has extream gory violent thoughts she likes to isolate herself from everything. She'll talk and then stop right in the middle of the sentance. She says odd things sometimes aswell. She finds it hard to explain things she takes critisism seriously very seriously she always wakes up in the 5am hour and then drops to sleep again. What does this sound like to you guys?
