I'm 18 years old, female. For the past two months or so, I've had a lot of different symptoms that have worried me. The most noticeable and persistent ones are a constant low-grade fever (only discovered a month ago), dull, deep aches in my shins and the hard part of my forearm (unaffected by physical activity or rest), and fatigue/lightheadedness mostly in the afternoon when my fever is highest (it ranged between 99 and 100). I've also had deep muscle twitches in the large muscles of my body, headaches on one side of my head, pain in what feels like my neck lymph nodes, joint pain, and middle back/rib pains with movement or breathing. The thing is, a lot of these symptoms are come and go. Some have been better lately, some have been worse. They really have been evolving. The only truly constant thing at all times is my fever. 
 I've had a lot of blood tests done. No swollen visible lymph nodes or spleen, white blood cell count and red blood cell counts are normal. No signs of Epstein Barr, no rheumatoid arthiritis factor. 
 The only things that are off are - 1, a very low positive ANA (very low though), 2 slightly elevated albumin protein, and 3, slightly elevated c reactive protein. I think my total blood protein is on the higher end of normal, but not considered "elevated" officially 
 I had some blood cultures done, and am waiting on the results. I had an echocardiogram and a meeting with a cardiologist, and got a clean bill of heart health. My doctor requested me to meet with an infectious disease specialist, but he looked over my case and said there's no reason for me to see him, so he passed me over. I now have an appointment with a rheumatologist in two weeks. 
 What on earth could be going on with me?
