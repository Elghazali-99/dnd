When i was about 4 years old, a 6 year old boy would want me to suck his penis and he would want to lick my vagina. I saw him once a week for a while as our sisters did netball together and our mothers were friends. He would pull down my pants behind the bushes and do stuff to me. I never initiated it but i didn't protest as i was only four. My parents never found out but after a year or so i no longer saw him as netball finished and our parents drifted apart. when i was 6/7 i realized what had been done to me. I used to cry myself to sleep every night, i was horrified. My parents to this day still don't know. I occasionally see him but we ignore each other. Seeing him makes me sick. I am now 16 and can never forget about it. Does this situation count as child molestation? Through out my life i have doubted myself as a victim because i was only four and he was six and i wasn't particularity upset about it at the time. i remember not wanting to do it but he would convince me otherwise. Is this a serious issue?
 I mainly want to know if this is real molestation or just kids being curious. I would also like to know ways i could prevent this happening to my future children.
