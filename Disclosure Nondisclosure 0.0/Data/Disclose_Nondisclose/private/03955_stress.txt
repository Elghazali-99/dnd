Every time I shower my skin on my legs and arms (and now increasingly on my lower back) gets incredibly itchy.  There is no rash that appears on my skin and the itching lasts for around half an hour after I get out of the shower.  It started when I was around 13 years old.  I use Aveeno body wash for dry and itchy skin every time I shower, which is made from oatmeal - It helps a little.  The itching is worse when I shave, but it helps when I use natural shaving gels that produce little foam.  When I exfoliate, it also helps the itching to be minimal.  I try not to scratch in the itching areas because if I do, it does not go away and gets worse.  I always moisturise after taking a shower, but it doesnt seem to help that much.  I find that the itching disappears if my mind forgets about it.  I find that I get more itchy if I shower in the day time than if I shower at night.  Is this stress related? Am I causing myself to itch by worrying that I will get itchy whenever I take a shower?   Please help!
