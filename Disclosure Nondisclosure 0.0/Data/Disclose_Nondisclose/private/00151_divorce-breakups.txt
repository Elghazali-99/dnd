Thank you for this forum cause I really feel alone. I am married now with my high school sweetheart of 12 years and am gong through a divorce (I filed) because on December 23, 2012 I received the worst phone call no wife ever want to get. A phone call from another women. The women you spoke with before and knew you and your spouse were married with 3 kids and tells me she is expecting a child with my husband. My world came crashing down… As far as I knew I was deeply in love with him, "I love you" texts and phone calls still existed and so did intimacy. I didn't see this news coming… it's like when I'm awake I'm living a nightmare and when I sleep it's the only time my heart rests from this immense emotional pain. My husband's family never liked me throughout our whole marriage and recently reached out to that other women and invited her to their home. Since my world turned upside down they have not once reached out to me and my children… I'm devastated… My husband finally opened his eyes and has begged for forgiveness but my heart is just to broken… I can't trust him again. "Father please forgive my in-laws and husband, for they do not know what they are doing"…. "Father, i'm just waiting for my healing, my heart desperately needs"… I pray for all the broken families, spouses…
