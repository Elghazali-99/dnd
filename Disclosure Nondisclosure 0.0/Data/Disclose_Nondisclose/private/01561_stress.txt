i'm just wondering is there anyone that can relate to my excessive flapping (as my husband calls it). i get very stressed out over the slighest little thing. if i feel the house is unclean at all i get really stressed and in bad humour till i clean it from top to bottom it often occurs as i've four young children, if a situation changes from how i had it planned i don't handle it well, i get very hot and really worked up over many things even slight situations that out of my control but cleaning and organisation is my biggest flaw i'm a clean freak perfectionist even with my kids(not good way to be trust me!) but this obsessive nature seems to be spilling over into my food routine some days i eat like a horse but feel guilty and then i go opposite way try not to eat i want to look perfect now too in weight feel like i'm going nuts at times and my husband could throttle me i'd say (of course he never would he too loving)
i just want to be carefree and relaxed for my sake and my children and husbands sake.
