I have been married for 11 years have no children and I have alot of trouble trusting my husband.  I am not sure whether its me with just loosing it and I need some help.  Following are the reason for my feelings
 - approx. 4 years ago, he joined a Relationships Web Site, set up a profile, no mention of me and formed a relationship with other women he had one phone our home......I discovered this he did not tell me about it.  He also tried to form another relationship with another women that he worked on her car.....but she was not interested in him.....I discovered this via sms messages and his unusual behaviour
 - he offen visits Ponograpfic Web sites -  but what I don't understand is that our Sex life - We don't have much of a sex live - Because of this it upsets me.  I think he still visits these site, but he is much smart and removes the history - so I don't get upset.
 - he is a agressive driver.....he scares me.......and I think does not care about how I feel
 - he smoke Cigarettes, Marijiwana, and likes to drink.  I find he his not able to discuss our issues when he is straight.
 - he his terrible with money, spends like no tomorrow
 - Often lies, can not committ to his promises/word.....I feel he is not committed and uses me to support him, care for him 
 - A recent incident occured.....I though was going to die.    We live on property which backs up onto serveral large Pine Trees and often these Pine Trees drop pine needles on our roof and because my husband has issues with heights, I am the one that gets up on the room and cleans the pine needles off the roof.   This one Saturday 25 degree afternoon - after my husband arrived from work, I got up on the roof to clear the Pine Needles from the roof to prevent our drains from blocking.  I am able to climb the ladder up onto the roof and walk around the roof confidently.  I am unable to come down.....I am scared to step on to the ladder from the roof.  We I do this Job I advise my husband to stay about in case i need anything, in case i fall, or want/need to come down because I am afraid to do it myself.   My husband stayed a little while, but then decided to take his car to the car wash, I asked him to do it later because I was on the roof.  He said he would only be 10 minutes and left to the car wash and brought a scotch and coke with him.  When he returned a neighour of which we hardly speak to called him over to ask him for advise about servicing/repairs to his daughters Motor Car.  I was on the roof, I was not feeling very well checked to see if John had returned from the car wash and started to call out to him.  After calling for some time John finally responded for me to wait.  This is when I realized he was at the neighours home.  I could not see him, but I heard he reply to my calls with - WAIT.  Time passed and I was feeling extremely ill and was not able to call out anymore and decided to try and face my fears and go down.  The ladder me soon as I attempted to come down on my own... I managed to remain on the roof....I waited I think patiently for my husband to return to help me down.  I was loosing it on the roof, Hot, feeling ill and extremely angry- I thought i was going to die.  My husband finally came, I called him every bad name in the book,  and he helped me down from the roof.  I directed to the shower with my clothing for some relief.  Angry out my husband I asked him to F off.  That he did, he went back to the neighours and continued to drink and talk the the Daughter of the neighhour. I managed to after a like while to get out of the shower and have a sleep to recover.  When I woke up, I went looking for my husband to find him at my neighours drinking with this young girl... not a care in the world.  I was angry and aked to come come, he came then her dog followed my husband which then he had to go back and return the dog....and of course decided to stay and drink and talk some more.  I had to go back to the neighour scream at him to come home.   I was like a MAD women - so not like me, I was so angry, leaving me while I was on the roof, knowing i was afraid to come down, feeling extremely ill, not comming when I called him, drinking, and after seeing the state i was in when i finally got down, he went back to the neighhours and continued to drink and I believe he chatting up the neighbour because he continued to go back - felt he did not care about me.  I feel I can not trust my life with him
 There are good things about my husband, but it is 4.30 am in the morning and I have to work t'morrow - I will continue this t'morrow as soon as i find some time  - but if you have any thoughts or advise to give, please forward them, the are most welcome, Thankyou
