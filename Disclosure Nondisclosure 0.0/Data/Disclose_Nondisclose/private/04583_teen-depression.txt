Im 15, and a freshman in highschool. people told me highschool wouldn't be easy, but they never said that it would be this hard. Last year i started loosing interest in everything around me. I used to love soccer, now i dont even play in the backyard anymore. I dont like spending time with people as much anymore. I feel like no one understands me. After chasing after a boy i liked for almost 3years, we went out finally last year. He broke up with me last December in the middle of the hall at school after lunch in front of almost our whole grade. I cried in the girl's bathroom for almost an hour before going to class. I dont think i've been the same since then. my grades dropped even more than they had been, and i didn't have any interest in alot of things i used to love doing. I started scratching myself which led to cuts. Now its been a year and im feeling worse than i did before which i didn't think possible. i dont know what to do with myself anymore. should i talk to someone?
