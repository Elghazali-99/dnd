My boyfriend and I became emotionally involved while we were both still married in our respective 17 yr. relationships.
We both separated from our spouses and divorced.  My 4 children have embraced him, but his teenage daughter will not speak to her father and it has been 2 yrs.  She only thumbs her nose @ him and rolls the window up in his face on their every other week 5 minute visit.  While we know things should have been done differently, we can't help but believe that we made the right decisions leaving our very unhappy marriages.  We had planned on marrying as soon as his divorce was final, but now he can't move on because his daughter won't talk to him and will never, in my opinion, be able to accept me or my children. Does anyone have any ideas on how he may be able to rebuild this relationship or can he?  Her mother is vidictive and will not support him as a father at all, when he was the one that really raised the daughter.  She avoids all areas where we may see one another, so the daughter never has to face reallity.  Please help!  We are all in agony
