Hi i am only 14 but I'm in love with 1 girl but I'm fat, ugly and I haven't even had my first kiss yet I've been trying to loose weight for years but Its just not working, I've been to weight watchers, slimming world and I have done a lot of Carnegie clubs but I've just been fat all my life, I am very self protective of what people think of me which is why I have not been swimming in about 3 years because I don't feel happy about my body, although i am fairly strong for my age I have delt with a lot of bullying in the past and when people say don't be afraid of telling the teacher if your bullied, well when I talked to the teacher it totally backfired on me and a lot of people did not like me for grassing so I did not have any friends for about a year but in time they did not bully me as much and I made new friends from the people that did not know me as much. Now there is just one girl I've been In love for about a few months and she is mainly the reason why I am still alive in the past I've tryed slitting my own throat but just the thought of this girl stops me every time I've had an overdose of my mums parasetemal before but it didn't work (don't know why, but I was sick for a few days) this girl isn't the most popular person in the world and she definatly isn't a slag so I might have a slight chance with her in the future but I've been very deppressed for a few years and I don't get out much so I am not the most popular person in the world but I get on with people at school so I'm quite sociable at school but out of school I'm always at home and I don't go out really that much with the few friends I have. I really want to be with this girl but we never really talk that much but we are sort of friends as we are both in the same english together, she doesn't know that I really like her and I don't think she has a boyfriend but I'm also scared that she does no I like her because she probably doesn't feel the same as me but I might be scaring her because when she walks into the classroom I can't stop but stare at her until she sits down at her desk I think I'm freakin her out as well when I look at her and she sees me in class, what should I do?
