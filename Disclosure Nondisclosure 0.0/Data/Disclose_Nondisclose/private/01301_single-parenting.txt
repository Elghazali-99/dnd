I'll start from the beginning of my story. My son's father left me when I was 3 months pregnant for a girl he was cheating on me with. He texted me here and there throught my pregnancy but didn't show he wanted to be involved at all, I believe it's because he felt bad. He is still with this girl and my son is 12 days old today and perfectly happy and healthy. Him and his girlfriend are not the greatest of people. They both have criminal history and are just messed up. His girlfriend is also very manipulative and just not someone I want around my son at all. For reasons of her criminal history and behavior. It is not a jealousy thing as I was not with the father for very long and have no feelings for him anymore. I just want what is best for my son and being with him and her I believe is not a good thing. He also has a history of not just criminal records but drug use and violence. All found out after we were broken up. For the best interest of my son he should not be around him. Now me trying to do the right thing I sent him a letter saying I had the baby and made it so he had to sign it so I know he got it and he couldn't say I never told him. He texted me saying he wants to be a part of his life now. He was supposed to come over on Saturday and meet his son for the first time, but texted me that morning canceling saying his mom had to work and he didn't want to go alone. I later found out he was with his girlfriend and her son the whole day. He texts me every other day about asking how me and him are. And told me he wants to come over this coming Saturday and meet him.. Now I am hopeing that this is either His mother wanting to know her grandson pushing him to do this or him just feeling bad and actually wanting no involvement for the reasons I wrote before. I just wanted someone else's opinion that didn't know the whole story and has maybe gone through something similar. Thankyou.
