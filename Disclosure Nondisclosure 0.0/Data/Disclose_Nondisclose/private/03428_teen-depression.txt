I learned a few months ago that my sister has been cutting herself she is 15.  It was devastating news to my other sister and I.  My parents divorced when she was 8 and my dad remarried when she was 11.  Our stepmom is mostly concerned with her daughter who is 10 and extremely spoiled and my dad only cares about making my stepmom happy.  We (my sisters and I) have stated before that it feels like we are our own family and our dad, stepmom and stepsister is another family just living in the same house. We don't live with our mom for various reasons but I don't think it's that important.  She started seeing a therapist and seemed to be doing better but lately she's been talking of not wanting to live anymore and refusing to see the therapist; this could be because she broke up with her boyfriend.  She hasn't been put on any medications for depression but I think she is definitely depressed.  I don't know how to help her and it's like talking to a brick wall or something because I'm the only one who she talks or wants to talk to but she won't take my advise or believe what I am telling her.  Can someone help me understand what she is thinking because I feel some of the same things but obviously I've been able to handle it better and I don't understand what is so hard for her.  I just want to know what to do to help her.
