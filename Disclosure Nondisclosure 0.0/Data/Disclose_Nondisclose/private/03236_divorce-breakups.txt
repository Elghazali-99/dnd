I was married for 30 years. Yes, we married young, but I loved him all this time. Men tried to pick me up constantly, but I never even considered cheating. He was not that popular, but he was able to find woman to cheat with (they all know he was married). His bank lady, his costumer's wife and such. I didn't know about it. Two years ago I got a breast cancer, and this is when he decided to leave and merry his last affair partner, his costumer wife (I presume, I was a damaged goods now). She was married for 20 years with 2 children. She got divorced first, hiding from her husband her affair, and making him believe that divorce was his fault. After she got everything she wanted, she told him the truth. And told my husband that he can now tell me as well. He didn't, but I found out anyway. I'm okay now (I only needed an operation, but, for a wile, I was a mess), and I still have a lot of men pursuing me, however, I lost trust in people, and worst of all, I still have feelings for him. Even now after his ultimate betrayal. How do you stop, after loving someone for so long? What do you do? He was just the opposite of the man he tried to make everyone believe he is (all the stories about family, family values, being honest - all his stories, all lies), and yet, I can't stop caring. I know he is just a shell of the man I loved, but still, I don't know how to stop...
