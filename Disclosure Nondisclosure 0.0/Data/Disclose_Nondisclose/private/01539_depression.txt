When I was a kid and a teenager, I seriously never cried. Not when watching sad movies, not when people died. I just didn't, and I hated it because it made me feel inhuman. Then I fell into a deep depression where I just felt utterly stuck in life and hopeless, and I became a major crier because I guess I didn't know what else to do. I began hysterically crying on average three times a day, the type of crying where you're laying on the floor practically drowning in your own tears and snot. I hated the depression and hopelessness, but I welcomed the crying because I finally felt like a feeling human being. I wished I could control it more instead of bursting into tears in public, but I liked that I could at least cry for once in my life. Now for the past about two weeks, I just can't cry anymore. I feel like I need to, but it's like I physically can't. I'm afraid I'm back to where I started where I am just incapable of crying, and that's very scary because at least the crying gave me some type of relief from my hopeless feelings. Not much but some. Now it's like there's literally nothing I can do to feel even a little bit better. It's like my senses are dulled in general, and the only thing I'm really still capable of feeling is hopelessness and frustration. I can't really empathize with others anymore or anything. I'm just a frustrated, emotionless robot.
 I don't think I'm making much sense. I'm so scatterbrained. I'm sorry.
 How do you get your ability to cry when you feel like there's nothing else you can do back? Am I just stuck back in robot mode forever? Is this temporary? I'm scared.
