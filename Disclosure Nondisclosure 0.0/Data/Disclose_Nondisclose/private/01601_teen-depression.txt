I'm an 18 year old female and in a bit of a state for something that happened in childhood.
At the age of 7 I was involved in a genital touching game with my younger cousin who was 2 years old at the time, also female. I'm aware that 5 years is a fairly big age gap between children playing these kind of games but at the same time I was still a child myself and knew nothing of sex or what we were doing could be classed as sexual. I hadn't been taught anything about sex and I'd never asked about it.
The game involved genital touching and it happened a few times over maybe a few weeks, I really don't remember how long it went on for, but I don't think it was for a long time.
This game was never forced, violent, threatning, abusive or anything of the sort. I never bribed my cousin or forced her to play and I don't remember ever telling her that it was a secret, she never told me that she didn't want to play, not that it makes it right but I want to stress that my cousin was never afraid or anything and I don't think there was anything traumatic about it. My cousin and I were still very close growing up and still have a good relationship to this day. She's 13 now, and seems perfectly fine, she's never had any problems or issues growing up. I don't know if she remembers it and I'm terrified that Its damaged her or ruined her life, do you think it will have? Will she be able to remember this with her only being 2 years old? I barley remember any details about it myself, I just more or less know that it happened, no vivid details or anything. I also want to add that I never did anything like this again and its my biggest regret and I feel a massive amount of guilt, shame, regret, worry and fear. Its consumed me completley and its all I can think about, I don't want to have damaged or ruined my cousins and her life.
