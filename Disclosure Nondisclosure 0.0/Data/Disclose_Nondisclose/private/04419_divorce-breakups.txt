I have a one year old girl whose father left the day i took a pregnancy test. He swore she was not his baby. Neither him nor his family contacted me. When my daughter turned 5 months old i sent her grandma pictures for her dad. She wanted to meet her granddaughter. After that the dad went back to jail this time for 33 meth labs! Nevertheless that's her family and i am trying to make the right choices. I've set up an account so he can call his daughter from jail at my expense. I've never recieved a call. But i still let my daughter go to her grandmas and aunts. This became an every weekend thing, for several days in a row. She comes back with a bad rash EVERY time, they keep her clothes, i haven't seen her diaper bag or medicines for 6 months now, her sleep schedule if off, she's clingy, they take her to the jail behind my back to force her dad to be there, they take her to do things for the first time without askiasking like see santa, get her ears pierced, drop her off to someone else when they have plans, take her to a slaughter house they work in... They love her I'm sure but im tired of the way things going and every time i say no she cant go or this can't be done they get pissy rude and call my mother!!! So ive ignored them for two weeks now and it isnt changing. Not to mention they are down my through about what i do all day when i dont answer their calls, who im seeing which is no one and if i dont text back in two minutes i get twenty calls full of questions. Not exaggerating!! Idk what to do about them, her dads not on the birth certificate and doesn't care. No one pays child support, helps me with food, clothes, meds. And now im not comfortable with her going anymore but then... That's her family. Plus if her dad gets out when he wants to be in her life i think he should come to me and we make decisions as parents, not ppl saying this is what he needs to do and put my daughter in danger. Advice? :(
