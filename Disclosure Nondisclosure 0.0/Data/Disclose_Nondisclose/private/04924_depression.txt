I have had a psychotic breakdown in Jan 2013 and since then major depression,felt so bad tried to kill myself with an overdose in June and since then started on venlefaxine up to 225mg to present-previously was on Prozac 40mg. I am so fed up of feeling nothing from anything,wanting to eat all the time and everday being the same-tearful and no hope. is it possible another SSRI would work for me rather than the SNRI I am taking? I am doing voluntary work with the animal shelter,have a light box, exercising,going to group therapy and a session of person centred therapy weekly also have psychological therapy due in March 2014 and eating wholegrains,friut,veg no alcohol,limited caffeine and seeing a few friends. So you probably see why I am so frustrated. Does it change in stages? Does your brain shift in its own time? I'd really appreciate any feedback,nearly 9 months of constant misery and I thought I may experience a little lift? Thanks a lot Miserable and fed-up of being fed-up.
