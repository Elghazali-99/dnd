Hi, I need to make sense out of my anxiousness that I get. I mean, It feels like I want to call it paranoia because I get anxious and tense in my mind/head and am in an unrealxed state. This comes on in response to constant worry, and when I stop worrying, and just realize I need to calm down I begin to gradually become calm. But the thing is that it will last for many hours, and to some extent it may last till the next day. Actually, I have been under constant concern and worry to some great extent about things for a while now, especially since a nervouse breakdown I had a year ago, still not recovered really! And this state of constant concern is what brings on my social paranoia, or anxiety. I feel like I have to relax myself, and get away from interacting with people when this gets bad. It happens kinda frequently. I mean it is almost always happening to some extent, but soemtimes  it is hardly there, sometimes it is not there at all and I feel basically relaxed and well. I mean not fully well because I am still telling myself that "I am still getting better" from that nervous breakdown I had a year ago". Does anyone else experience this or know what it sounds like? I basically get skeched out and begin a process of trying to relax. It comes and goes! Also, my head is often very tense, and my temple veins swell! Finally, I am often concerned about things, and cannot handle criticism. I am trying to get better, but need help understanding how severe it is. If you have any insight please let me know. i would really appreciate it!!
