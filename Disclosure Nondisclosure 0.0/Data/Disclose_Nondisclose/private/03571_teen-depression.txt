Ok,well my dad died when I was five.Right after he died my mother married another man who abused me.Much to my relief 6 years later they finally seperated.Shortly after they divorced my brother began to abuse me.He would give me bruises,bumps on my head,black eyes and choke me even though he knew I have asthma.I even woke up to him standing over me with a knife once.Then my mom met another man and I was forced to move away.I was once again relieved because my brother wouldn't be moving with us.Soon after we moved my mother and step-"dad" began drinking and fighting.Now three years later I'm 16 and I live with two verbally abusive alcoholics.My mom blames everything on me.She calls me the devil and says I'm the worst mistake of her life.My step-"dad" and her fight constantly and at times the cops have been called.I have been hiding my depression for about three years now and recently started to cut myself.I think about suicide every day.I just want my life to be over.I want help but I just don't know what to do.Any advice?
