I'm currently taking mirtazapine for depression, which was brought on in part, my daily migraines and also problems at home that's whittled me away. I hit rock bottom August last year and have been signed off work since then because I just have a hard time coping daily. 
On top of this, I can't face anyone, Ive always had an issue with social situations as I'm lacking in confidence, so always think I'm going to say or do something wrong and the other person will just think I'm stupid. So I shy away from meeting people, I could only manage it if the other person was very talkative and out-going so wouldn't notice my one worded answers or simple nods of the head in a conversation! 
BUT, right now, I'm so very low and have so much hate and anger towards myself, that now that my depression has taken over, I can't go out, I leave the house only if I have to! (My chronic migraines and constant brain zaps make me basically bed bound anyway) I don't talk to anyone and avoid people 
I broke down in front of my doctor because someone I knew was in the waiting room at the same time and I was petrified she would see me 
I was out the other day and because I couldn't remember the way to a supermarket, got so confused I couldn't hold a thought and had to abandon my chore and come home. I no longer see friends, or talk to them. 
I am becoming a complete mess! 
My fianc√© doesn't understand as he is a social person! How do I get him to see how it is for me!? Even being there in the doctors when I broke, doesn't seem to have got through to him and when he had a friend round last night (I stayed in another room the whole time) he came and asked me to say hello to them!?!?! 
 Sorry for the very long post, I'm not sure how to explain in shorter words, although I know I've run the risk of no one bothering to read it :-/ 
Thank you if you have though
