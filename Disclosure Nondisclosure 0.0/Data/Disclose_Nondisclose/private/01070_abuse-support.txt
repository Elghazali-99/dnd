I lost my virginity to my half uncle. I loved him and knew what was happening. We were involved romantically and sexually for many years and even lived together. I have spent the last 25 years believing he abused me because when I told my husband to be about my father being a child abuser (which is true) and said I had had an affair with my half uncle he told me that wasn't true -  I'd been abused. I never felt abused by him. I didn't feel any of the things I was told I should feel. And somewhere between the counselling sessions, my husband and by then 2 small kids I began believing that. For years. I've been depressed to the point of several overdoses. I've been promiscuous, taken terrible risks, I've been a heavy drinker. 2 years ago I decided to sort my life out. And I have done, I'm doing really well. Working, sober, calm. And I've been going through old boxes of stuff I've not touched for years. Memories. Letters, cards, photos. And I was right. He didn't abused me. My father did but  not my half uncle. Is it really so impossible to accept that happened? It's off the scale of socially acceptable I know. It is also illegal under UK law. I also know that. But that is not what has messed my head up and then messed my life up. It was living like a victim who bad things had been done to by a sick evil pervert. That's not what happened. Is it really truly the case that I have to keep these thoughts to myself? Will not one person not try and change my thoughts to make them agree with theirs? I think I am alone.
