Hi...my name is Laura and about 5 months ago we bought a new house.  During the week we were making offers on the house I went thru the most stressful period I have ever gone thru.  I mean, I had severe stomach problems during that week, bouts of crying and depression....it was horrible.  To say the least, after the final offer was made and the deal was set in motion....I acquired a discomfort/pain under my rib cage on the left side.  It radiates from the upper front of my rib cage to the lower back and fluctuates from a sharp like stitch (like when you walk or run to fast) to dull annoying discomfort.  Its been going on more so than not for the last five months and the funny thing is, is that drinking alcohol relieves the discomfort.  Also, I have found that when my mind is busy, it doesnt bother me at all.  I swear I have a tumor, because when I lay on that side it feels like something is there.....but to touch in that area I feel nothing. And sometimes I swear that its moving or something.....like its having little spasms, its really strange.  Im just wondering if the stress of that week and the stress of moving and trying to sell the other house is or could be causing my problem?  I have not been to see a doctor for fear of getting bad news....I know, stupid....but Im scared.
 Any info, would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
