I'm almost 16 years old and for the past 3 years i feel like i have never been truely happy with anything. I went through some stuff when i was younger with my parents as my mum was only 16 when she had me, it was pretty rough growing up. However now i go to a great private school, i have lots of friends, alot of people always compliment me but i feel like they are lying. I feel like that nothing is really worth it and i think about what the point in life is alot. I have thought about suicide a fair bit and i did attempt to overdose once. I self harm now and then by i do try my hardest not too. I dont really feel anything for people anymore, nothing other then hate. I used to fall for guys and stuff really easily now i have trouble feeling any kind of feelings. I never want to go to school because i hate people around people. I drink a fair bit and i occasionally do drugs. Just because it makes me forget. My dad has bi-polar disorder, his dad had it and his dads mum had it, there for it is kind of genetic but he said he has never seen signs of it in me. Although i see him once every school holidays which is not very often. 
 I cant concentrate at school and i dont get the best grades. I feel angry a fair bit and i have a ridiculously low self esteem. I'm so over everything, and i am sick of feeling like this. I can't tell my mum or dad, not even my best friend. I need help, what do i do?
