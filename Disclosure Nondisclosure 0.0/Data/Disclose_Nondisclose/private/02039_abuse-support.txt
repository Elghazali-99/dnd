I think I may be addicted to abuse, I dont even know if it is possible, but when i was little, my father would abuse me verbal and emotionaly, it was constant, I would be called a **** *****, ****,skank, ect. by own father, he would purposfully contradict himself and blame me. I felt suicidal for the longest time till my friend beat me to it, and then I woke up.The pain I felt when he commited sucide is something much worse than all the abuse in the world, I would never wish upon anyone, especially the few people that did love me. I did used to cut bcz of my father, but then he would start to smack me around, and thats when I felt a strange relif. It was weird, but in my mind I felt it better then when he was screaming at me or saying all those horrible things.
I rarely see my father now, but when I do, nothing has changed. 
 Now, I purposefully put my self in abusive situations, pick fights, party hard enough to get smacked by my guy friends, especially when I am feeling hella upset.
Also, I can never seem to make relationships work and as I look back I have caused so much drama in my life because of that relif I get when I get beat up, or I would be with an abusive dude,get scared and blow him off before anything begins.
 I know this sounds soo horrible and I must be viewd as a complete moron for feeling this way but I can't help it. This is how I feel.
I apreciate any advise or info given?
