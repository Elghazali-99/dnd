I have been with my boyfriend for a few years, we have a 2 year old daughter and we have always planned on getting married when i am a little more stable. I feel like i have tried so many therapists taken so many pills but as soon as i would slip up he would be onto me about "not trying to get better" and suggesting i didn't care about bettering our realtionship. I know he has stuck with me when most people would of been long gone as soon as i first hit or exploded for no reason. I just feel no more love and I can just see him growing tire of waiting for me to get better and i know it's selfish but i just cant cant cant deal with it, i can't even remember the last time we have had sex and when he tries to touch me even hug me i feel so disgusted. He says i make him feel perverted but he has stuck with me still, But im still so lonely and two nights ago my ex bf from years ago texted me and made me feel so loved which i know is ridiculous but i needed the attention even tho it was wrong. My boyfriend saw the texts and just ended it all. I just feel like BPDs just dont deserve love. no one should have to put up with our constant pushing and pulling, I hurt everyone i love. Im so selfish. 
Sorry this is not exactly a question and also i apologize for anyone attemping to read through my horrible puncuation.
