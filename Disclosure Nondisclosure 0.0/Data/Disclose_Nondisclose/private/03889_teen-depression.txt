I am 18 and a senior in high school. I have been struggling on and off with depression for the last 4 years. It's only my mom and I, and we are pretty close. But I still don't feel completely comfortable telling her I am depressed. When everything first started she knew something was wrong, made me talk to a psychologist... I hated it and we never spoke about it again. 
Now 3 years later, My boyfriend is the only one who knows what's going on, he has encouraged me to talk to her about it. And I'm apprehensive, but willing to do it. We have been together for a year now and he is a big part of my life and family. My mom has always loved him and they get a long great. 
I would really like my boyfriend to be there to support me when I talk to her, but I don't want to make her more uncomfortable (it could go two ways-she would appreciate him being there or wish he wasn't there). I don't want to upset her more, but it's definitely going to be harder to do it alone. I do want my boyfriend to be part of whats going on, and would love if they could support me together. 
What do u feel is the approate thing to do in this situation? If you were a parent what would you want?
