I just found out that my three year old daughter was being molested by her 8 year old half brother. Who has only leaving with me and my husand for only six months. I am so hurt, and upset, and lost. I am so angry with myself for not protecting my daughter. I should have paid attention to my daughters behavior. My daughter has not been the same in the last six months, I thouught because it was a transitation period for her. She went from being the only child at our house to having someone living with us. It all started when she asked me to play the teachers game her that her and her brother played. When I asked what the game was she told to lay on the bed. She reached over to kiss me on my mouth and tried to touch my private area. When I asked what she was doing she said that is the game her and her brother played togther. what should I do in this situation. Her brother has moved out, but I dont know what I should do with my daughter should I get her help? Is my daughter going to remember this? Should I seek legal help? I honsetly dont know what to do. Help!!!!!!!
