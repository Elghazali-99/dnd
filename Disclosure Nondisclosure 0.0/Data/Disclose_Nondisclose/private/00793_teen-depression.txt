don't read this post if you are homophobic, please.
right anyway, the situation im in is really depressing me at the minute. There is this lad in my year, no-one would expect him to be bisexual but i know that he is, he asks me to do things on webcam for him and even rang me one night and started talking dirty, hes the basic lad, plays all sports, one of the big hard ones in the year and always flirty with the girls. I think about him all the time, more or less every minute of every day i think about him, i have had a bad past with him, he's been a bully to me and all sorts, i recently told a close friend about how i feel towards him and what he says to me and she thinks that hes only done the bullying in the past to hide his sexuality but really she thinks he has feelings for me, yet he is still a really bad knobhead with me, excuse my language, but i can't cope anymore, i really want to get over him but i can't, then again i really want to take this a step further and do something with him, some help please!?
