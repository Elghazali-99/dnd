I've been feeling depressed for a long time now, probably since last year. I feel like I'm worthless and that no mater what I do I wont matter. I dont feel like people care about me, and I feel lonely. I also have sex with guys to try and feel loved, so that I feel for a while that someone likes me. I have quite a few friends but I still feel like people don't like me. That I hang out with them, but once I leave they wonder why I hang out with them. For the past couple months I have started crying for no reason. Like I don't have to be really sad but I'll feel like crying. I don't feel like anything is worth it anymore, once things getter better, a little later things feel worst than they started. 
I try really hard to get great grades(all 'a's), keep fit, have friends, and all that, but it doesnt make me happy, i dont even feel accomplished I just want to do more so i might feel something.
I don't feel good enough for, 3 out of 5 of my boyfriends have tried to get at my bestfriend after dating me. Making me feel like I dont even matter compared to her. That poeple will always want her over me.
Some days I feel really happy though, I feel popular, and pretty, and just happy. But usually those times don't last and I'll be upset again.
I dont know what to do. I wanna get therapy but I don't know how to bring it up. And plus i'm embarrassed to tell my mom. I just don't know what to do anymore, things just dont get better
