I've been dealing with my Emotional and Physical abusive parents for 21 years now. They have manipulated, accused, trapped and lower my self-esteem. I Desperately want to move out asap. I have been getting these certain "talks" from them since I was very young. They would (and still) explain to me how I need to "change" and to be more "respectful" meanwhile, the problems in my intermediate family is my fault. To them I am a cold-hearted, careless *****. I have found myself in past abusive relationships with guys and feeling guilty to no end of what *I* have done. My parents have blamed me for those relationships, the closeness that my brothers and I do not share. My dad has over-the-top yelled in my face constantly when I told him to stop, he has hit me on the head and told me he was "allowed to". My mom has hit me as well on the head, arms, pushed me on the ground and have received bruises. The arguments have turned into me sitting there crying, to now me trying defend myself and lash out when I wish I wouldn't. 
I have no friends, I have no close-relatives, I'm not in any relationships as of currently. I have told neighbors in the past, councilors from grade school and even in college. I've also went to therapy, but did not like the way she approached my situation nor did she have the experience of having an abused patient. Therefore, I stopped going. 
I am at my wits end, emotionally drained and numb from suppressing my day-to-day life. I'm sick of running into the same patterns with people to the point I am afraid to get to know anyone anymore.
There is so much bothering me (even from my past), I want to stop going to college. I want to find myself and heal all this.
 Is there any helpful advice you can give me, that would be wonderful. Thanks!
