my fiance and i broke up about two months ago when i finally called the cops after he pushed me and sexually assaulted me. he had been violent for about a year, and i put up with it and igored it and believed i deserved it. my question is that he told me i verbally abused him. he was a liar, and when i'd catch him in a lie, instead of leaving like i should have, i'd get mad and call him an f-ing liar or coward. he said my verbal abuse is what made him violent. 
 around christmas, he stood me up at a party. when i got home, i was mad and broke two of his video games and threw his clock out the window. when he got home, he was pissed and told me it was abusive of me to break his things. those are the only things of his i have ever destroyed. i realize that instead of getting mad at him for lying and b.s.ing me, i should have just left. but i never thought i was abusing him. i have never tried to control him or make him do anything. i just got mad and yelled and then calmed down and apologized. but maybe i'm wrong and that was abuse?
