Hi--
 I was recently called with the lab results of a recent blood test to check out my hormone levels after months of high irregular periods (a few months of a 21 day cycle with periods lasting 4-5 days, followed by a couple months of 28 day cycle periods that lasted 10-14 days -albeit not heavily the whole time) and a general feeling that all's not entirely well.  Before that I spent four months on the pill at my prior gynecologists advice (to even things out) and had to go off it when I started heavily breaking out and feeling terrible.  Before that, I was getting the 10-14 day periods for a couple years.
 The results are: an LH of 99, FSH 30, and normal estrogen (sorry I forgot the number) on day 21 or 26 of my cycle, depending on whether you want to count the day it started heavily bright red (26) or the day I started getting the browner variety (21)...   
 Also-- I'm about 9 years out from an autologous bone marrow transplant to treat Hodgkins Disease.  I'm 29 and still in remission.  I did not have radiation.  I also didn't have periods for about three years afterwards.
 It wouldn't surprise me if these things are related, but my question would be, are these possibly early menopause symptoms? or just the new wiring of someone who has probably put her ovaries through stress with the treatment?  Also does this mean I'm infertile?  And is there anything I can do or need to watch out for?
 Thanks for your time.
