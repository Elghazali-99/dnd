I am 5 mo pregnant and my boyfriend and I planned to get married and was looking for a housr together after I became pregnant we started having heated arguments and he would call me out of my name I would do the same and I know how ro defend myself. I am just wondering if he was stressed because everything was moving so fast. We found a house for me him and my 10 year old but I decided not to move in because of all the arguing. When we broke up he was still there for the baby as far as doctors appt and apologized for his behavior he also was there for me if i needed something.we have been together 2 years and he is the sweetest person and caters to me cooks for me takes me out etc but when he drinks he can say things that i dont like and wr argue then he will apologize other than that he treats me like a queen. We even started going to church together with my 10 yr old and we have started couples counseling he had thrown things in the past when he got angry but not at me and i have also thrown things but he had never put his hands on me and i dont think he ever will he had told me many times he doesnt believe in hitting women. Since he is going to counseling with me and putting effort to show me he wants to change I am considering moving into the house that we picked together and giving it another chance we have been getting along good for the past couple of months I am now 5 months pregnant. Would like to hear any advice Thanks!
