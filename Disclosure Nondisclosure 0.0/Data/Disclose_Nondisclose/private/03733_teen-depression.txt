Hi,
i have only recently joined and i am not in the best place. This year has been pretty tough and i thought i would get it all off of my chest at once. It started off with my bad AS grades, they were horrific and made me feel like i wasn't good enough, especially as my dad is a genius who is also dyslexic, i can relate, my mum and dad fight a lot and i have been to six funerals in the last 3 months. I just feel like i have grown up and everyone around me is still loving life, my friend jumped off a building this year and although i have tried to tell people around me they still make jokes about wanting to kill themselves, my sister uses it as her personal punching bag spot whenever she can't handle her mental issues (i know it is a horrible way to phrase it but i can't think of any other way to explain it) i feel down all the time and i used to use my religion as a tether to stop me from floating away but the past month has all but severed that chain, my grades have plummeted and i am constantly worried about my impending future as everyone seems to be handling it with ease whereas my philosophy is to do the bare minimum as i just don't have the energy or will power, my mum set me up with a counsellor but it is early days, it is hard to talk to my parents for all the shouting and disapproving looks. I feel like i have to shout and scream to be heard as my little sister is blocking the entire door leaving me no room to knock, she takes up all their time and i am supposed to accept it. I have kind of finished my little rant and i just want to know how to stop feeling like the world is crashing down around my ears all the time.
