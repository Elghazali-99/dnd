My friend ended our relationship with anger, hostility blunt words and out of control emotions. I felt very emotionally attached to her and now she is gone. Yes, there was a age difference, I am 52 she is 39. In the beginning I was the very best she ever met, everything I did was perfect and wonderful. over the last four months everything I did was bad and evil. I worshiped everything she did. I now know she  is BPD. I think of her often, when we last spoke she said she was seeing someone new.  In the early stages of our relationship she told me she tells everyone that same thing whenever she wants to separate from a boyfriend or even a friend.  I know she is extremely mentally ill, I think of her and worry about her often. I have learned at her work place (been there abt 10yrs) she associates with no one and no one in her work knows anything about her. And I mean nothing, not even if she lives in a house, apt or a treehouse. NOTHING. I have also learned all of her relationships have ended with this out of control anger. Usually about one year. DO I continue to worry about her?  Should  I still care?  WHat are the chances of her having any kind of life?  Any kind of relationship? Any kind of career? What can I do? DO I just walk away?
