Hello,
 I don't even know if this is going to work but please do help in any form? Me and my wife have been super happy and married for over 3 years, Our relation has been like a fairy tale where every birthday or hers or any special day I try make it as gorgeous as possible taking her wherever best I can, Ive been a heavy gamer all my life (Xbox / Playstation) where From the period of December to April I have had a lot of conversations with a female (Whose face also I have not seen) but still I did speak quite a bit while mostly all of it was about politics and games etc. there are 3-4 times when I have spoken foul 1. I have mentioned in a joke that I am allergic to Condoms, 2. In a museum we saw dinosaurs and this girl asks me how were they and i joked saying they were naked and thirdly once I spoke of the word 'D**k' in reference to 'Bananas' for reasons I have no idea but I never spoke much about this to my wife, I have casually mentioned about her 2-3 times but not said there are times we chat online for an hour or two etc. (( ofcourse, the above is very brief but point is I know I have done wrong ))
 On our vacation to Italy, she went thru my phone chats, and she now is devastated,  and I always have advised her in life, never ever be with a cheater, and here in this case it's me who cheated, is there any way I can make her believe that while I was dumb during speaking to someone online, It was not a genuinly reason for me to cheat? I have never even had sexual discussions with the person, nor any such feelings but wife feels when I joked about allergy to condoms I was hinting at it, I don't even know where this person lives or anything but I do understand my wrong is wrong, it's been over 4 months now and as of last night wife has even moved out, shes been the reason for every smile or mine or every reason for me to be happy in life, can I please ask how to get her back? please??  
 I know some of you may call me scum etc, thats fine I am, but I seriously want my wife back next to me im willing to do anything for this but I want her back please?
