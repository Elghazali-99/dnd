Those of us who struggle with this disorder are:
deep
sensitive
loving
creative
emotional
thoughtful
intelligent
charming
engaging
interesting
We struggle because we don't know how to regulate our emotions.
We are often times overwhelmed by our emotions.
We have a lot of shame, sadness, and guilt, and we don't know why. 
We spend more time being angry with ourselves then we do anyone else.
The slightest hint of criticism or a disapproving look can pierce us like a sharp knife.
 Also i don't know about you guys but a lot of times i feel like there is a void inside of me. I feel empty and lost. 
But today is a knew day 11-11-11.
I say we make this day a great day. 
BPD help day. We all help each other.
since therapists are always too busy, doctors don't know how to help, and we all have ourselves.
We are beautiful people just like everyone else, we are just different, and i find that beautiful. We should stand strong, and not let the stigma get the best of us. And not be suicidal because there are young girls and boys that may struggle with the same thing and look up to us because we are here and still standing strong and because we can help the best we can. Would you want them to look up to us, and say well she had bpd and she committed suicide so i probably will too? NOOOOO.
Make a stand for yourself and for all of us who have this disorder, and feel happy about yourself, and love yourself. And always remember that this illness does not define you , and you can always make it better, and your life better. Be strong healthy and happy. And everyone have an amazing day. Because we are capable of anything after all we've fought through.
