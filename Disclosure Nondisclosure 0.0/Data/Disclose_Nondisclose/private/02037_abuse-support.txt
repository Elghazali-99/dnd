(Sorry aboutvthe backstory)
About 3 years ago I was in a horrible relationship with a boy who enjoyed breaking my heart very sadistically. Upon our last break up I was completely distraught and during my break at work decided to get high. A guy (who's name and face I've completely put away) had been a friend of mine and begun to flirt. I think he realized I was high and took complete advantage of it. I had gone to clean my work restroom and he followed me in. My first reaction was he was playing and with my mind fuzzy I couldn't help but laugh. Next thing I know I was pushed against the wall and his mouth was all over mine. Long story short I was too high to fight back or even scream. At the time I had believed I deserved what had happened... He forced himself into my butt rather vigorously and I couldn't go to the bathroom right for two weeks. Now its been three years and every time I have a bowel movement there's blood and its increasingly painful (no constipation.) I'm wondering if he could have ripped me but I'm not sure. I've tried to go to the lady doctor but she had said there was nothing there (granted. I hadn't had a bowel movement that day at that time) but its reoccurring. What is going on? And is it something that needs to be fixed?...
