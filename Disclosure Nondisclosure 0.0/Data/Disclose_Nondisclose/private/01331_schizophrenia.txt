Hey everyone, hope all is well! 
 Im looking for advice really because i feel like i'm gradually losing control of my life. I've struggled with desperate empitness and sadness for the past year or so, never really paying much attention to it just figured i was fed up with my job etc. Over these past couple of months things are really hitting me hard and im scared my grasp on reality may disapear.
 Before my 'depression'  (undiagnosed) i was a pretty sociable guy with a good sense of humour and was fairly upbeat most of the time. However my depressed state has taken all this from me and I feel like a changed person. I have no interest in life. Im not suicidal, but death doesn't bother me anymore. I've isolated myself from my family and friends. My friends have said that i have issues and that im 'disturbed', which has made me question how much of an effect depression is having on my mental state.
 These past few weeks i've been really on edge and anxious all the time. My brain feels like its working overtime all the time and random thoughts/urges are racing through my head. For instance, i'll be sat on a train and i'll get this overpowering urge to stand up and say something obscene. I know that im going weird because everytime I think of something funny to say my brain over analyses it and replaces it with someting bizarre so that if i did blurt it out people would be like, "wtf is this guy on."
 In the beginning I had a fear of being homosexual, this has passed now I have a fear of going crazy and I believe this is happening because my thoughts are becoming increasingly unrelated to the topic of converstation and the things I find funny other people find strange. Life is just a bit overwhelming at the moment one minute things will be going well and i will be optimistic and then the next I'll be so low to the point of despair.
 Sorry for the long *** post. Can anybody relate to these symptoms, whats happening to me??
 Cheers :)
