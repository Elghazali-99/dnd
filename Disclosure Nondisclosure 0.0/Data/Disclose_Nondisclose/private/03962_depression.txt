Hello. 
 I'm a 21 year old female, 5'2 and 154 pounds. I have been killing myself to lose weight, eat very little and only good food. I work really hard to not eat the food I enjoy (fast food, ice-cream, chocolate, etc) and I try to be much more active. It's been a hard and long process... 
 Yesterday, I was put on medication for depression and anxiety. For the first week 25 ML of Sertraline and chlordiazepoxide twice a day. I am overweight, and constantly tired. I told the doctor that I have heard Wellbutrin is the only antidepressant that doesn't make you gain weight, but he promised me I would actually lose weight on Sertraline. It is really important for me to not gain any weight, and actually continue to lose. I will not be able to handle it. Since yesterday, I've been constantly thinking and worrying about this. Honestly, I rather be depressed and miserable and have anxiety attacks that result in trips to ER, than to gain the weight I've been kicking my butt to lose. 
 I am so worried about it. I don't want to try it out and gain, that's like a huge step back for me. The thing is, I already eat so little, so it's dangerous to cut back. I eat under 1000 calories a day, sometimes even 500... But I know I gained a lot of weight because of food. I'm so scared of taking this medication. I did take it today, and so far (It's been about 9 hours ) I haven't experienced any of the side effects (because of low doses)... It's just that I can't stop worrying about gaining.
