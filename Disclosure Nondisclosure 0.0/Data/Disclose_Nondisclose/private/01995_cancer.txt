Hi, my name is Shaykh. I need some reassurance. I am an asthmatic, and I recently quit smoking cigarettes. I wasn't a heavy smoker until this past summer. For the last 3 months I was smoking almost whole packs a day. The most frequent that I have ever been smoking. I stopped because when I got sick (I believe a cold), I coughed up a bit of blood in my phlegm.  Now that I have slowed down with cigarettes and completely stopped occasionally I will find spots in my phlegm. I can't tell if it's Brown or black spots. I'll be honest. Only thing I smoke now is marijuana if anything. I have no symptoms that are abnormal for an asthmatic. Sometimes I'll have shortness of breath, but as of now I'm breathing fine. I have my inhaler or primatine pills when I do feel I can't fully breathe. I haven't felt weakness or fatigue. No severe chest pains. Just recently the spots in phlegm. I've seen others ask about this and they were told that the body is ridding itself of  the toxins from the cigarette smoke. I guess my question is, is that true? Should I be worried? Especially since I haven't been a heavy smoker that long?
