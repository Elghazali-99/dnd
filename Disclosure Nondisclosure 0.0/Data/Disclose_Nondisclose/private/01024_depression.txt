A couple of weeks ago we lost our dear pet who we considered our child traumatically and I can't seem to shake this horrible feeling. My husband was home with me these past two weeks, we both cried everyday. Now that he's gone to work as of yesterday I am actually feeling worse. I lost 10lbs from being physically ill. I have looked for online support groups and counseling in our area. I haven't been able to find anyone local. Today I got in the car and was going to force myself to get something to eat, at the stop light I bursted into tears and just came back home and cried my eyes out. I don't know if this behavior is considered normal but it sure doesn't seen normal to me. We've gone thru all sorts of pictures and we have pictures that were up in the house before this all happened. We tell him we love him and miss him but I wonder if this is making things worse?? We would prefer to keep the pics up, after all he was a huge part of our life for 14yrs. I just don't know what to do or how to make things a little easier. I don't expect we will ever be over what happened but I feel like I'm losing my mind. We are happy when we think about the good times and seconds later so devistated about loosing someone so dear. Has anyone experienced anything like this? Did you find anything at all that helped your depression? Meds are not an option for me at this time. We had a very special bond with him. He not only needed us and was amazingly smart but I became dependant on him thru some pretty hard times. 
Thank you in advance for any information you may be able to provide.
