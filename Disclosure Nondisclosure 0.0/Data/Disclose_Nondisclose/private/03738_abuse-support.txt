Hello everyone.. im just going to stsrt off with ive been in a relationship for three years with the father of my daughter.  I have another baby on the way as well to him. Hes a great guy! Dont get me wrong. But when it comes to our relationship I question him. Hes cheated on me soo many times.  Weve honestly even been on the steve wilkos show (he called) I did leave him for about six months to give him his space and mayne calm down. But I took him back after six months. And ges was good. .. for the first three months. Then he cheated again. I told him I have no reason to stay with him. At this point I dont. He knew it was his last chance. Hes also been physically abusive in the past. Not since ive taken him back tho.. now its all emotional and verbal abuse. Like before I took him back I foumd another guy. And my baby dad fought for me back... so now that he cheated on me he sits there amd brings up the pther guy all the time. But we werent dating when that happened.... this is because of his guilt right? Cause he never brought it up before he cheated.... now its an everyday thing amd I hate it. It drives me nuts! If I wanted that guy I would be with him... what can I do to get him to stop??? Ive already tried talking about it. Je just explodes because "I had sex with him" but like I said I wasnt with my baby dad at that time!
