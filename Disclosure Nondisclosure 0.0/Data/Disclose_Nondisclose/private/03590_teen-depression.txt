Hi, well.... I dont even know where to start. My family moved to a different country, I feel alone, I dont like my body. I'm just a huge mess, my life is a mess. Since we moved here, I have been sad; I miss my friends and my family. Whenever I try to talk to my parents about my feelings, they just ignore me, or try to talk abut something else. I've been trying so hard to adjust to my new life, but it seem imposible to try to fit where you don't belong. I feel so alone, nobody understands me, I don't know what to do. it is obvious that if you want to talk to someone, you should go talk to your mom or dad, but I can't. I just don't know what I did to deserve the life I have. Yes, I know that I have to be grateful because I have a beautiful family, and nice friends, clothes, food, etc. but I just don't like my life. I started watching YouTube videos, and yeah, I love Youtubers and One Direction. I think that they are the only people in the world right now that an make me happy. But now my parents don't want me watching videos all day. I have good grades in school, I do my homework, I am responsible, why do they want to take away my happiness? I also have socal anxiety, and i just can't. I have a list of all my flaws, nobody is perfect, but I'm certanly a huge mistake. I have tons of problems. I have been trough a lot, and I can't find someone to talk to. My parents know that I don't like it here, but still they think I'm happy. It sound so lame, but I'm sick of everything. If I could, I would move back to my birth country, where I do fit, where I feel happy...BUt you know what? I can't, and thats my life. All I ever loved or wanted is two thousand miles away. Do you think this is fair? What should I say to my parents? How can I deal with my anxiety and sadness?
