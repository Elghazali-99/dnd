6 yrs  ago i started dating a man  that  i  had  a relationship with  over  20 yrs ago  we  love  each other  so deeply  our love is  so deep  when my marriage  ended  we  started  dating  and because i was   putting my kids and  their dad   before  the relationship the relationship started going  south. a couple years ago he had  a break down and  was soon diagnosed with  paranoid schitzophrenia which turned in to him loosing his  sex drive   and  missing me  which really broke me   he moved  6 hrs away  and we  have grown farther and farther apart it seems as though our  lives  are  going  down different paths.but not  to gether. he is my soul mate but  he made the choice to move  far away to  get more resourses   he claims once he gets  better  he will come for me  but i know   he wont  get better  he is  already allowing the  disease to control him.he wants me to wait for him but all i see is me alone i have been getting closer to my ex husband   in  which  he has asked me to reconcile   and i could  get a normal life back  but  how  do i stop loving this man so deeply so i can move forward with my life  he  doesn't have many people in his life  and i want to be there for him when he needs some one i don't want to abandon him he means to much to me. i feel so tired on   a nother note  i feel  so  scared i am going to  screw up a marriage again that i will fail i feel if i  reconcile i wont be able to  love  the same  way as  this guy has  a huge part of my heart  that i have  tried to take away from him  many times  but it doesn't work  how  do  i allow my self  to  have  sex with  some one  new  when i  still feel so connected to this other man. Please  be  gentle with your  words i know  this  sounds ****** up  but i  feel i have no where else to  turn. i am  grasping for  any thing
