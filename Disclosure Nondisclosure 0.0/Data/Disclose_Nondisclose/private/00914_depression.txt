Hello,
I had some concerns about getting off Zoloft. At my most dependant I was on 250 mg and over the past 2 years I have weened myself down to 25 mg.  I am taking it crazy slow because about a year ago I tried to come down and got so anxious and depressed that I went back up to 50 mg which I am aware is an incredibly low dose. I see a psychotherapist once a week and we talk about my concerns and anxiety/depression. I notice that at this 25mg dose I get these crazy low moments where I feel like the world is just turning in on me. The symptoms are quick and fast sometimes lasting a couple of minutes. I have been learning to meditate to help with the anxiety and I do practice yoga 3-4x a week. I have a healthy diet and do not drink too much caffeine because that does add to my anxiety.
Anyway, I'm wondering if these anxious/sad feelings are because I have been on Zoloft for +17 years (put on when I was 13-15 yrs old) and my body is just not accustomed to the low dose? Are these just side effects? How long will this last and will it go away?
I hate talking to the psychiatrist because her great plan is "to stay on for life bla bla bla" and all doctors I see are always pushing the same but I would love to try and power through this if I know there's hope that all this WILL GET BETTER and I just need to keep on. 
 One more mention I have/do take some natural mood elevators like omega 3s, krill oil, HTTP 5, cromium...all the good stuff.
