I'm 35, married, no children (not for a lack of trying).  I tend to have severe PMS and often take codeine (from my doctor) for the pain during my cycle.  Normally, during my cycle, I am very sore and everything gets very achy.  However, my current cycle seems milder than normal, but I'm feeling a sharp pain in my right breast.  
 I did a google search (I know, google can't REALLY solve every question or puzzle) but it did bring me here.  I did note that on some of the pages it brought up in my search that breast pain, from soreness to sharp pains, can coincide with a woman's cycle and is fairly common.  Now, the pain I'm feeling now is definitely uncomfortable, but I wouldn't go as far as saying it will drop me where I stand.  
 Also, I have naturally low blood pressure (I always have).  My husband seems to think this might be my body reacting to a ttoth issue I had earlier this week.
 Like I said, this isn't like wretching pain, just odd short pains.  They are not coming every few minutes or anything, and I usually feel it when I take too deep a breath or start moving around a lot (just getting up and getting something from the other room doesn't seem to cause it, it's when I start rushing around or trying to get things done too fast).  Should I be worried?  Has google made me blaze?!?! 
 Lastly, I do have anxiety issues.  Could this maybe just be like a mini panic attack?  I'm not freaking out...  I feel oddly at peace, in fact.  But everything around me has been a roller coaster the past weeks, and I haven't had an anxiety episode lately.
 Any advice, insights, well, anything would be appreciated!
 Thank you all for lending me a moment of your time (that I cannot give back! sorry!)
 Truly,
Morgan
