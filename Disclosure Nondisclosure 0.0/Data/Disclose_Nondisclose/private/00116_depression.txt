I'm not sure I trust my psychiatrist like I did before.  I've been trying to taper off my Prozac for about 5 months from 40 mg.  I was originally at 60, but we lowered it to 40 last year.  Anyway, when I went from 40 to 30, I felt more sensitive to things around me and like it was easier to get upset and want to cry.  But that got better after I think it was 2 months.  It's been another 3 months since I went from 30 to 20, and I feel more sensitive than last time we went down.  I'm also having cold-like symptoms almost constantly and feeling much more anxious--not quite to the level I was before, but I haven't felt this anxious in a long while.  It seems like it's easier to make me frustrated and/or sad, too.  And for the last month or so, I've been able to sleep 24 hours straight; I literally did that once, and have had to force myself out of bed for dinner a few other days.  What's going on with me?  Is this normal?  Will it go away?  Can I keep going down on doses eventually?  I don't want to be on these meds forever.  But I want to be me again, and if that means I have to take them for now, I will.
