I am 14 years old and lately have been very sad and upset. I sometimes even cry for no good reason and I get angered and irratated easily. I have been through a lot in the past year my step dad and mom divorced and I went to live with my father and stepmom and I found out my mom is in a relationship with a woman when I know she is not gay. I haven't had the same interest in the things I use to love like song writing I can't get any ideas out and I use to scrapbook and I started playing guitar a while ago but want to gove up. I keep my feelings in usually until im alone in the shower and then I break down and cry.I have normal eating habits still and dont think of suicide I'm actually scared to take any action on that. In school I know enough people but usually plaster on a smile and I am very quiet in school unless with friends. I dont feel happy in many cases for no reason. I have been really tired during the day and Im starting to take naps and I have to question if I should skip school in the morning because I dont care about it and speaking of school I haven't been doing well in my classes things dont come easy to me as they use to. I always just want to stay in my bed and I am afraid of the future I'm getting pressured to know what I want to do and do better in school its just so stressful.I also have mixed feelings on the way I look sometimes I think im so ugly and compare myself to my sister and friends and other times I think im okay looking. I am worried and scared to confront any of my family members about this what should I do I would appreciate any help of any kind. Thank you.
