I'm a 21 year old male going on 22 this year and I have been suffering from depression for maybe a little over 2 years and anxiety for even longer. So I've had been on only two medications so far at their lowest dose and they haven't been working as well as i hoped to the point were i wasn't sure if they were working or not. The first time i was in college and when my medication ran out after maybe a couple of weeks later and struggled to find time to go to see a doctor I really wanted to maybe see if had a more natural option because i don't like the idea of being on meds so i got myself some St-johns worts and I felt initially that they helped but not on a tremendous level and again sometimes i wasn't sure if they worked and i believe to have been on them to the point were i should be able to notice some change. I couldn't help feeling maybe trying some other medications and that would help me so again i started one again on its lowest dose and same thing not sure if they worked and haven't been on them for maybe a bout a week now after they ran out. Foolishly i know there is suppose to be a withdrawal process and i haven't ever looked into or went back to my docs both times when i ran out of my meds and the last time and even now so far i felt/feel literally nothing afterwards and my doc didn't seem to be heavily alarmed but, anyway. A big part of me wants to try other meds or stronger ones i've heard some success stories and my doc even shared one about a patient she has. I'm not at like the end of my rope or anything but, I wanna know if I cud turn to st-johns worts again and try it again I'm guessing there is different dosages of those as well at the super market. Is it worth trying those again and maybe getting a better result if i maybe take a higher dose and give it a longer time? I wish i wrote like a journal but, I think physically i felt better on St-johns too. Any advise would be cool thanks.
