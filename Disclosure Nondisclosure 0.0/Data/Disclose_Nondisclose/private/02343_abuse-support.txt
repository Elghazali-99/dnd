Since i can remember there are parts of my life that are missing.  It seems as though i can only remember things through pictures.  I mean large parts of my life gone even now.  I have been with my husband for 12 yrs and there are still days I miss.  he try to remind me of a conversation we had and i cant remember,  the whole day i cant remember.  I dont know whats wrong with me.  I have been in 2 date rape situation.  i never call the police or anything always figured it was my fault.  And there was one time i was at a party and fell asleep not passed out i mean fell asleep, and awoke to this guy i know fondeling me i was 14 or so.  i move so he couldnt touch me and again said nothing.  When i was about the man that had always been my uncle, he was married to my aunt so he wasnt biological, but still my uncle.  one day out of the blue said GOD you dont know how bad i want to f**k you,  I let that situation in a hurry then a couple months later my aunt had a new years eve party and he got me really drunk.  being half passed out he started touching me his wife in the other room.  i think he thought i was completely out i kept trying to move so he would quit but he didnt until he almost got caugh!  never did i go back... they divorced a while later.  still noone knows.  how can i remember this bad stuff like it just happened to me yesterday,  but i'm missing so much more.  Is it because i was far worse then what i remember, or what   i was telling my theropist about the missing time she said it sounded like repressed memories.  I told her i really dont think i want to know what happened to me.  she said i need to remember and would through it and get passed it.  I really do NOT want to remember, since i have such bad memories now i cant even phathem what i dont remember.  Please tell me what you think!  Am I just crazy?
