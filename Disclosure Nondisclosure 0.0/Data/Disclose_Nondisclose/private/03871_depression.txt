Hello! I'm new here and I'm not sure as to how to work this site so please forgive me if I'm using these features wrong. I may have severe depression. I recently took about 3 Do I have depression test and I scored really high. They all said that I had severe depression. I'm not sure if those test we're accurate so I came on this site to ask people who do have depression if this is depression. 
 I have low self-esteem. I'm always downing myself. I don't consider myself to be beautiful, gorgeous or anything--that's why when people call me stuff like that I let it go in one ear and out the other. I rarely post pictures of myself to the internet because I'm afraid people will make fun of me so Instead I used cartoons or pictures of celebrities. 
I have suicidal thoughts. I've never attempted to kill myself but I do think about it sometimes. I even once, Googled ways on how to kill yourself. I guess I haven't attempted it because I'm way too scared to die. I feel that life would be better off without me If I die.
I cry for no reason. I could be having the time of my life then I just burst into tears. Why? I don't know. This often happens. 
I can't focus on anything. Because of this "depression" my grades have dropped, My reading skills are poor along with my Math skills. My mom thinks it's just me slacking but it's not. I try my best to focus but I just can't. When I try to read my mind just goes crazy. 
I can't sleep at night. It only takes everybody in my house hold about 20 minutes to go sleep but it takes me 45 minutes to an hour. 
I have recurring negative thoughts that I can't control. They come back to haunt me.  I try to stop thinking about them but I can''t. 
 Does this sound like depression? I think it does.
