I'm 45, will be 46 in August. I have Hashimoto's disease (hypothyroidism) and Type 2 diabetes &take medication for both. During the past 4 years (my thyroid condition started in 2005, diabetes in 2007)  my periods have basically been absent, having only one to two a year. My endocrinologist, at the time, said i was not in perimeno as my gyn dr had previously said (this was in 2005) & that my thyroid was the culprit. I recently undewent an endometrial biopsy which was negative. I also had hormone blood tests, ordered by my current GYN, who says for sure that i am in menopause.
 FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone):       24.8  (it looks to me to be on the high side)
 LH (Lutenizing Hormone):                     27.5 
 Progesterone:                                     0.5
 Prolactin:                                           5.7
 HCG, Total (don't know what that means):     <2.0
 I am presently using Progesterone cream to try & balance my hormones, i can't take HRT due to blood clot risk, i actually developed one 3 years ago from taking them so i'm trying the bio-identical route. I'm also having the hot flashes and abdominal bloating & cramping (phantom periods). My last period was 3/1/07. I wouldn't be complaining if it weren't for the discomfort that i'm in. I just wish i knew if the progesterone cream was working.
Anyone else?
