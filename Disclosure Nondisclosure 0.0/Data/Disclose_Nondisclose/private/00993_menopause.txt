I am 46 years old and am very cycle regular with 29 day cycles.  I had an unplanned pregnancy at age 44 that ended in miscarriage at 13 weeks in spite of a normal cvs genetics test.  We have neither been trying hard to get pregnant or not get pregnant since then.  My last period started on May 25 and lasted for my average 4 days.  On day 16 I began having a light brown discharge that lasted 4 days.  Not to be too detailed,  but this was so light that it was primarily on the toilet paper and only a tiny spot twice on my underwear.  No cramping or feeling bad like a normal period.  My real period was due this past Wednesday, June 22 and has not come.  I immediately took a urine pregnancy test- negative on Wednesday afternoon and again on Friday morning.  I am going to test again in the morning.  The pregnancy that I had at age 44 did not show a positive urine test when I tested 6 days after my period was late so I am both excited and nervous that I could be pregnant again.  I know that no one knows for sure, but anyone ever had a phantom period during menopause or in pregnancy?  I will obviously see my doctor next week if I can't figure out whats going on.  I will be very happy if I am pregnant and this time I will transfer to a high risk doctor as my sister wanted me to do last time- she's a nurse.  Keep me in your prayers please.
