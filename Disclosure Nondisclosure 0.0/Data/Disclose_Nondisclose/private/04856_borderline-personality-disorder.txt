I am a 37 yr old guy. I have been diagnosed with depression 2 years ago and I was on medication. I have been discharged from being depressed early this year by the psychotherapist. 2 months ago, I quit my job because I felt that I was taken a ride by my ex-employer. I have joined direct selling and other commission based services several times, but each time I am about to start, I somehow will have excuses and end up not continuing what I have started. Maybe, it is not the right thing to do. I believe I also have low confidence despite being a professional. This could be because I sometimes interpreted things wrongly and I criticize myself harshly. I don't have the motivation to work. I feel sad because I cannot provide the things that I used to provide to my wife, yet I don't have the motivation to change my current state. I just feel that I can apply for and secure a job but later on, I might just quit. I was a people pleaser and I believe I still am. I don't know what I want for myself since I have been people pleasing in the past. Even the professional qualification was my dad's, not mine. Am I having a relapse of depression or am I having some other ailment? What can I do about this? It is eating into my soul each and every day. Sometimes, I just feel like going...but I can't because of my wife and family.
