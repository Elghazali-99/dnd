Well I just posted on here about a situation with a friend that brought back really bad feelings and things from when I was molested as a child. Well to make matters worse today I saw my molestor. He comes to my house from time to time to get my dad to do car work for him.  I am never comfortable when he is around.  I feel as if they (my parents and him) don't care that I get really tense around him. Its like they don't ever bring it up to talk to me and they never did. It's like some big family secret or something. Like I remember when they finally found out they asked me what all had happened and I only told them some of it like the things about his "sit-down games" or the pornography he would draw (my cousin was an artist) and force me to do what I saw in the pictures ...It was horrible! I told them about Barney to..My cousin knew I like Barney as a kid and the whole thing started by him telling me to "use my imagination" He was fixing my shirt and then he went under that shirt to fix my "imaginary shirt"... So much I never told my parents about the days he took me in his room or what would happen up my grandparents house and the only way they even found out was through my babysitter (another cousin) and it sucked for them because they were out on a date the night that they got the call to come back home and it was urgent... It like now I am older and the feelings from it still haunt me and sometimes I feel so overwhelmed by the memories and the feelings I get. Like today when my cousin started talking to me and then pretending to play punch me I tensed up and felt really paranoid and guilty when he left. Then there's the cologne he wears and whenever I smell it I get nauseous and then I am flooded with bad memories...I don't know what to do about this feeling...The experience friday and the fact that my cousin cam e over today is really getting to me and distracting my life....I don't know what to do
