I spent the day reading all the posts about menopause. And can relate to some of them. Unfortunately I have a few more to add. For 12 years I lived with the hot flashes and interrupted sleep three or four times a night and vaginal dryness.Then it progressed to sleeping for twenty minutes at a time. And as usual with the lack of sleep came anxiety and desperation. My obgyn put me on hrt. Divigel 0.5 a day. And it helped with sleeping and itching. Then a new issue popped up. I had bladder issues such as burning and pain and frequent urination and lets add to that vaginal bleeding and burning. It felt just like an infection so I was tested for an infection and there was no infection.  I was in so much pain that I couldn't sit or sleep. The Dr added Esterase and it worked like a magic. That was five months ago. Last week I was diagnosed with breast cancer. And I terrified. Terrified of so many things. Maybe more of the process than the outcome. One of the things that I am concerned with is the fact that I will have to get off the HRT and I'm not sure i can survive and heal with the daily pain that my bladder and vagina will dish out. Not to mention the lack of sleep. I have looked into the Menesra and Maca root that was mentioned here but has anyone found anything that will help with the bladder issues? I'm very concerned that I won't find a Dr that will believe me and help. And I think I might turn into a raging monster. 
Thanks for your help
