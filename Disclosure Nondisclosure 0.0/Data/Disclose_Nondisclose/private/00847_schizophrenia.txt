I had read somewhere that schizophrenia affects different people differently. So seems to be the case with my mum. In case of mummy, it's effect does not remain permanently. I mean it affects her sort of periodically(not exactly periodically). 
 She becomes completely different when it's on her. Her voice becomes very low unlike her usual loud loud voice. She starts weeping frequently on small things and strange things, and she probably suffers from hallucinations as well. She also almost disconnects herself from us, becomes irritable, says absurd,senseless things. She also becomes careless about her hygiene and becomes very inactive.She's on medication since a long time.
 She was quite normal till yesterday, when i talked to her on phone it seemed like its onset again. during last attacks, i was slightly immature and handled it very badly. But this time i want to handle it nice and well.
I looked for information but it didn't help much. So i need to know what as the cause for this disease and how best the family members should get along with the affected and everything else you can.
 Please respond..
