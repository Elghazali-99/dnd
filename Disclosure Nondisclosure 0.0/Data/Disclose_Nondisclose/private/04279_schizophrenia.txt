I have been with my boyfriend for a little over a year now. It was literally love at first site. Since the day I met him my life has been all about him. When he was in his early 20's he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and paranoid schizophrenia. He gets angry very easily and sometimes I feel like I have to walk on egg shells.  His disorders act up more when hes under an extreme amount of stress. Shortly after we got together he got into some trouble and was sentenced to 7 years in prison. We have been doing the best we can with it. He's always been the jealous type and would love if there was some way for be to become completely invisible to every other man on earth. But a few month after he went to jail it all spiraled. He constantly thinks im cheating or that im going to leave him for some "fucktard college frat boy" his words not mine. I do my best to stay calm and try to reassure him that he is the only one for me but it obviously doesn't help. He had such a bad episode 2 weeks ago that he went as far as to accuse me of being a prostitute and told me that I was cheating on him with my step dad! I love him with all of my heart and WILL  stand by him through his sentence and his "issues". My question is how can I comfort him and put his mind at ease so he can truly believe in my love for him. With out trigger him or upsetting him. I want to learn how to handle this the best way for the both of us.
