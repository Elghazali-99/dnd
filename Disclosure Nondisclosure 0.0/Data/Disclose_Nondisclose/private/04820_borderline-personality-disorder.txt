I have a 10 yr old stepson whose mother is nars.phsy. Of coarse he is not allowed to like me his dad  his 14 yr old step brother or his two yr old twin brothers. (We are all her enimies, it is all our fault she is miserable, and has nothing) He is forced to lie about bruises and markes left from abuse, he is so mentally abused by his mother it is sickening. The police will not get involved because they do not want to deal with her, teachers do not want to deal with her, and slowly but surley his freinds parents will not let their kids go to her house for fear of never knowing when she will loose it (parents who before were convinced she was perfect but have had the oppertuninty to see the true self). Question is how does a person undo all the damage a perent like that does. Will I ever be able to help him. I am 33 yrs old, have not ever even heard this term much less dealt with it. What do I do as a step parent to help? I fear his saftey everday. It is a very scarey feeling.This woman is crazy and does not care about ANYTHING. She just wants to drill into his head how we have just taken from her, and his father must hate him or he would not have left her, so it is his responsability as her son to hateand not want to be here in our home as part of this family. Do you think she is dangerous?  Very sad situation. Please direct me.
 Thank you for your response. (Much appreciated)
