I'm wondering lately and now especially if i am supposed to be here? i have had the feeling for some time now that i am supposed to be dead.  i can't help feeling that is why i fel so bad is that i should have died and my life is unnatural.  of course, i know that may sound crazy and if someone told me the same thing i would probably tell them its ridiculous, but it seems to be the only thing that keeps consuming my thoughts is i am not supposed to be alive anymore.  i dn't understand why it is so difficult for me to end my life, what is holding me back. i think about killing myself and imagine how long would it take even someone to notice my death? maybe a week? these are the thoughts that go round and round. i don't need any links to a crisis hotline or what not, that is silly to me. i cry all the time and wish i would just die and don't understand why i can't get myself to do it, though i have come what i would call close a number of times.  i just wonder has anyone else experoenced this?r is it just me?
