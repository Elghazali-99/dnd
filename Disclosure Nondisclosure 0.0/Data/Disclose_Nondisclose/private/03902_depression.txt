I have a girlfriend long distance relationship she's 32yrs old she's really, really beautiful She's Filipino she's from the Philippines CEBU City she's poor witch is sad though her and her mom and brother live in one of the houses that they build, She had a job once but they closed up and she can never find a job at all she says it's so hard I'm 27yrs old I'm from the states We are everything each other wanted in a woman and we are content she's just like me in certain ways how we think she's really smart girl she don't have much anyways I feel bad for her, They got affected by the typhoon it destroyed there home and wiped out everything they did have, They are living in a tent till they get it rebuild I love her with all my heart we talk all the time online we used to see each other back in July and August it ended on camera cause her internet got cut off because everything is getting harder she usually don't eat for two months her mom gets money some how for them from friends But they have a lot of little ones nieces and nephews.... 
 I'm going to send her a care package for the holidays, She can't really talk to me but she reads my messages she is saving her phone battery they wont get power back on sometime in Jan :/ But I feel sorry for her we both wish there is a miracle that we can be together I do believe in some and something tells me something's going to happen I know it's really hard over there she said I'm her last love she loves me, and she's content with me she's very loyal and very honest same with me even if it's online long distances But it's hard for me to since I can't go over there all the damage and stuff and people tell me it's not safe place it ***** for me to as well, Will there be a miracle or just see what the future will bring she's my first girlfriend I tried so much to get a girl and i got a good one but can't see her like I want to, It's sad But I'm not like everyone else though I'm actually content just the being physically there and to do things with her hurts.
 Reason I can't find a girl around me is everyone is so straight with kids, I don't want that and I have a strong love for Asian woman so she's everything I wanted
 And her family knows she's a lesbian, she has the whole vibe to her, her sister knows to and all as well her sister even told me when I was getting information to send the package just think positive we are meant for each other she said.  We also help a lot with each other, we are both depressed we both give each other courage and encouragement with things she wanted to die at the age of 40 some how she said she said she stays silent somedays and don't talk to no one, I talked her out of that she said I give her hope to live longer. She loves me she says and she said lot of people don't really know how she is I understand her she says to other people she's around she's just this happy person that nothing is wrong
