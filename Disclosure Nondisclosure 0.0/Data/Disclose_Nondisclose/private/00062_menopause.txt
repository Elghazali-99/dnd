I feel so embarrassed. I work in the medical field yet I have been blind to my own symptoms. I am 47 and on Mircette for birth control and as a prophylactic for migraines - so I do not have a period. For the past three months or so I have been waking at 3am (despite 100 mg Trazadone that had been working fairly for several years) soaked in sweat. Sorry for the run-on sentence. Anyway, I attributed this to stress and a worsening of my Anxiety NOS. I'm currently on 75 mg of Effexor which a PA gives me and doesn't ask any questions. I was on 150mg and I think that worked better but I asked for it to be decreased because Effexor isn't the best drug to be on. Boy- I keep ranting - sorry but I'm excited that I may have stumbled on the cause of my constant, nagging, almost disabling anxiety of late! The other day it finally dawned on me - maybe I'm in peri or real menopause. Maybe that's why I wake early drenched in sweat -  and maybe that's why my anxiety has taken a turn for the worse! Yesterday I went to the drugstore and the pharmacist suggested Remifemin. I was concerned about drug interactions - I'm on Synthroid, 'Effexor and Mircette. She said some HRT OTC stuff has soy as a component and there could be interaction there. Something about Soy mimicking estrogen? I have no idea. Anyway, has anyone else tried Remifemin? She said if I started on a higher dose of Black Kohesh (sp?) it might be too much at once. This has a lower dose than taking the later straight. Also I read coconut oil helps. Anyone have any other suggestions? I'm excited cause I can see hope and an end to this uncomfortable anxiety.  Thanks
