I've been a stepfather to both a stepson and stepdaughter for 2 years.   My stepson is now 15.   I have known my stepson for 7 years and over that time our relationship has been tough but over the past year has gotten much worse.  In general I have no problems with my stepdaughter.   I use to have activities that I could do with my stepson but now we have nothing we enjoy doing together.   I find myself very irritated by many different small things that he does.  Small things like not doing his dishes(constantly reminding him), him fighting with his mom about doing homework, and always wanting to eat special made or bought meals just for him is just driving me crazy.   
 I've had several discussions with my wife about my feelings over the years but attempts to fix the issues have failed.   She is at the point where she is happy with the way he is and views me as always finding problems with him that need fixing.  This has increased my irritation to the point where it's impacting my feelings for her and I find myself not wanting to go home (needing to stay away from the entire situation).
 I also had a very bad relationship with my father where I always felt I could never do enough to make him happy.   Both my wife and I wonder if that is what is leading me to have so many issues with my stepson and none with my stepdaughter?   
 Any help on where to begin to try to accept these things more and not allow them to anger me would be appreciated.
