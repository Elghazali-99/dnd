Im 16 and from  the age of 7 to 9 I was sexually abused by 3 different people. I just recently told my mom about my brother and she does not completely believe me because every time she has asked since I close up more and don't give her details. I have put up a mental block so some things I don't remember to be able to tell her but I do know  that what he did went beyond the normal curiosity of children. He told me I deserved it and that nobody would believe me if I told on him and he is 6 and a half years older than me. My uncle and family friend also did this but only my brother knew he wasn't the only one. I have not told my mom about my uncle because him and his wife and 2 kids live next door and I feel as I I would be ruining their family. His wife is the actual person related to me and I love her very much and I dot want to see her go through that. I just don't know how to cope with my mom not believing me or how to deal with the uncomfortable feeling every time I am near my brother or uncle
