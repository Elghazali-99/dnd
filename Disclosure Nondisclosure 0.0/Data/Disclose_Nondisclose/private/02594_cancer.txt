When I first discovered the mass, it seemed like my whole abdomen had a hard flat shelf in it with just a little bump at the top.  Then the mass became about soft ball size, and now larger over four years.  I do not have problems eliminating either urine or feces.  I have a duplex kidney on the right side (two urethras coming down from kidney) and by now , due to urine reflux my right kidney is almost gone.  When I had x-rays of my abdomen back in 2003, before the mass, it looked like there was something shaped like the calcium capsules I was taking at the time, in one of my urethras on that side.  The mass is not painful unless it is pressing on something.  It sometimes has a heartbeat (I am 74 so not pregnant)..  It is bumpy and not exactly perfectly round. Sometimes it is at the belly button and sometimes it is more to the right.  I do not have much money for doctors or the $1,000 x-ray, so I am trying to find out what it could be so I can treat it.  Currently I am taking pancreatic enzymes to see if that helps.
