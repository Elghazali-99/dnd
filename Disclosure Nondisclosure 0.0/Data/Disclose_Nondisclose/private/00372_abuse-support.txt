I am a 27 year old female, in a loving relationship with one child.  For years now I have been emotionally abused by mother and it has only been recently that I am coming to terms with this.  I have suffered and suffer from GAD this is down to my childhood, through abuse with my mother, domestic violence and sexual abuse by my grandfather, (my mothers father, who also abused my mother). I would like to know why my mother does not bother much with my son, there is no bond there at all, and she questions my mothering skills on a regular basis.
 My son idolises his Grandma, which makes me feel very very hurt, but also at the same time I feel ashamed and embarrassed because of this, and think why she could do this to an innocent young child.  I have tried for many years now to build a normal relationship with my family for the sake of my son following all of the trauma that has happened I always seem to seek re-assurance from my mother but I have come to terms with the fact that I will never get this from her, but I do not want my son to experience the same treatment as what I have done over the years.
 I live very close to my mother, so I find it hard to keep her at arms length from my son, and wonder what is the best thing all round for a happy healthy future and childhood for my son.
 I look forward to hearing from you.
 Thanks Claire
