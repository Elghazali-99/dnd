We have friends of the family whose 40 something daughter has severe schizophrenia and is bi-polar.  She was not always this way.  They told us it started coming about 5 or so years ago.  She has completely lost touch with reality, is refusing to eat most of the time because she says the good is contaminated because her parents touched it and is losing weight rapidly becuase this.  She is paranoid and hallucinates.  She has been held on a 5150 two times, after her parents were force to call the police due to her behavior, but the mental health facility she was at had to release her, because she refused to submit to blood work.  They said they need to do blood work to prove she is not taking drugs, but to also test her for any condition that may be making her ill, i.e. brain tumor, stroke, etc., in case there is something physical causing her mental health problems.  They said because she refuses this, they have to let her go after the three days.  They have no choice but to let her come back because they don't want her out roaming the streets.  They've just resigned to the fact that they are stuck and will probably watch her die, since no one is willing to help them.  I don't understand this, as I have never heard of having to have a mentally ill person's permission to run blood work on them.  When someone is critically ill or injured in the hospital, they don't wait for their permission to run it.  Does anyone have any suggestions on what they can do to force her to get help or force the mental health facility to hold her past the three days?  They agree that she is very sick, but say they legally cannot hold her.  She is in major denial that she is sick.  They live in California.  Thanks.
