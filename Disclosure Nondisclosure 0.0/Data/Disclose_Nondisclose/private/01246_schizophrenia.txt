My son has been hearing voices since he was 7 years old, we have seen several dr's and specialists, one said he has early onset schizophrenia, and prescribed melatonin, and rispiradone,, excuse spelling, then was told its stress.... first of all my son told me when he was 7 years old, he hears several voices telling him they are watching him, and roaring in his ears, he would also see shadows day and night following him, he thinks ppl can read his thoughts etc etc, these episodes come and go in waves, but he is now 11, not been medicated for over a year due to them changing the diagnosis of post traumatic stress from loosing his father when he was only 4 years old, his father passed in a car accident, my son was not in the car and did not see the accident, anyway recently he tells me he has to kill himself before they come for him... by this he means the voices, they tell him he has to die and they are going to kill him, he gets strange feelings of being watched, gets nervous and anxious, when he has these episodes he wont go out the house, just sits on the pc, wont wash etc, today we went to chams and saw a psychiartrist, who says they will put it to panel and see us in a few weeks, what the hell do i do in the mean time when my son talks about suicide... i am in tears i feel like he is not believed and i have wondered is this down to my parenting, is he attention seeking.. etc etc,, i am alone with him bringing him up on my own with his sister who has globel developmental delay / austic spectrum disorder, i am so drained, i just get scared i am going to loose my boy. i just want to know what is wrong with him, and how i can keep him safe, but have no support and cant talk to outsiders due to fear of my son being ridiculed. PLEASE HELP.
