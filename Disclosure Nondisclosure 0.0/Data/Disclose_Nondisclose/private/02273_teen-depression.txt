So I'm 17. I'm cyberschooled and a senior. I'm failing when I use to have a 4.0. 
I never have the motivation to do my school work and although I panic constantly about it, I can never get myself to do it. 
My dad made me stop taking my meds. 
I work at CVS pharmacy and I hate it. I hate the work and some of the people are awful there. I want to quit but I'm too anxious to quit because the assistant manager really likes me and I feel like I'll dissapoint everyone if I quit. I'm miserable and don't want to be there because it's destroying me but for some reason I cannot get the guts to quit no matter how hard I try. 
My life is just spiraling downwards. I've been single for six months and I'm a lesbian so it's not easy to find someone. I feel lonely and feel like I'll never truly be loved. I have no friends really and my dad is never there for me. 
I keep thinking that suicide is the only way out but I know I just want a solution and can't think of one. I just want the pain to stop..
