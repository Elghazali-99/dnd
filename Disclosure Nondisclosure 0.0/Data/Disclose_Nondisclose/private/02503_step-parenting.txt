I am a step father for a girl who's 9 years old. I am also a bio father for a girl of 5 y.o. I live with their biological mom for about 7.5 years.  The step daughter never met her bio father because the bio father did'nt want any attachment to his bio-daughter. my wife came to me mainly because she had nowhere to live and also she wanted a real father to her daughter. my wife asked us both (me and step daughter) to refer to each other by "daughter" and "father" and asked me to hug her frequently. the step - daughter was too young (1.5 y.o) when she first came to my house to know I wasn't her real father. but me and my wife just told her the truth about my relations to her and about her bio-father.
Now the fact is that the relationship s.d. and me   are ok most of the time. except that s.d. don't listens to me as expected. she often say to her mom Im not her real father. she is also becoming quite a  difficult child at school and at home. often, my wife is not satisfied from my attitude towards the s.d. and ask to divorce me and the relationship between me and the s.d. is a  major issue. from my side I try to keep good relations with my s.d. one more thing also my wife's grand mother told me "you just can't stand your s.d. right?" .so In fact I am being criticized about my parent ability by 3 ppl: wife, s.d. and my wife's grand mother.
I want to strengthen the relation between my s.d. but I don't know how to do it. any advice? thx.
