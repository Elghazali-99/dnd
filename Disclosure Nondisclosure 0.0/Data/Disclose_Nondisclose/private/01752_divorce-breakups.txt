My husband decided one day, about 3 months ago, out of the blue that he wanted to separate after almost 18 years together. We have one child a 15 year old son. I was completely blindsided. He stayed in the house a month after telling me this while he was trying to find a place to stay. I found out he was cheating on me during our marriage and I think left me for the woman. During the time he was staying at my house he went out on dates, brought women over while I was out of town, and was just very insensitive. He finally moved out and I have begun the process of rebuilding my life. The problem is he texts me about his day. For example he will text I bought a shirt today, I tried a new drink, and other random daily happenings. Lately he has been telling me how his life ***** and he has lost everything, his house, his dogs, and his garage. Which really upsets me because he left by choice. I begged him to stay and give it another shot. I was the one betrayed. What do I do? How do I respond? Any input on why he is doing this?
