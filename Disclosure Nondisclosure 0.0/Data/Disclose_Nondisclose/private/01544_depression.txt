Ok, so i have hit a horrible depression...i did once before at 15 and tried to kill myself but my mom found me and i went to a hospital for about 3 weeks to get better...i was put on anti depressants and anxiety pills,,,
i am 25 year old female...i was with someone for 3 years and they were my life. He took my to Tahoe in the beginning of Sept and told me he has fallen out of love with me...and that he would rather do Heroin. I tried to talk to him about it over the next few days but he just started to get rude. He said i was a horrible girlfriend and a nightmare to be around. I have been crushed. He was NEVER this person and i don't know what happened. He was the first person i have EVER invested in. He was my everything and after a 3 day vacation i have nothing...no answers.
 I am not close with my family...at all....my father molested me as a young child and my mom knew about it but was sleeping with the pastor of our church, so she didn't stop it...I guess i have always had a hard time with trusting guys...or girls for friends...so i find myself alone now at home cutting myself. I haven't cut since i was 15 but it helps...but i have been 2 minutes away from suicide for the past 3 weeks...i went to the doctor and they don't want to give me any pills for it...which is crazy because in all my health history, drugs, pills, or anything like that i have never had a problem with. In fact, i hate taking pills so for me to go to a doctor and show him i'm hurting myself and want to go all the way with it and have him deny me medication just makes me feel like there is no hope....
 I am a strong person...or at least i thought i was until my investment dumped me...i just need help and i know that! I cannot go away for another 3 weeks because i have a job and would lose it, and not be able to come back....but if i died, it would be like quitting, right??
 I am just afraid i am going to take this to far and i don't know who to reach out to at this point...
