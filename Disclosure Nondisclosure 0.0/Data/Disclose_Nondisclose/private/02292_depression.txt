This might be a bit long so bear with me pls.
My parents are having financial problems and until we start earning again my life is pretty much on hold ,can't do anything or proceed until we have money again and because of financial problems recently i got sad and had a panic attack sort of like what will happen now.
So i started reassuring myself by saying "good times are coming" and so forth but this was helpful for a while ,it gave me a boost in my mood ,i felt a little better but then this phrase stopped making me feel better so i came up with more phrases to say to myself in my mind, same thing after a little while they stopped working and then i noticed i was getting clingy when talking to someone ,i wanted to keep on talking to people.
But now i keep saying these phrases over and over again to myself but they have no effect but the reality now is things are actually getting better.
Soon our financial condition is going to improve ,things are in play and i know this but i still keep saying these phrases to myself and i still feel sad ,i keep talking to myself in my head that "its all good now" 
"Time to be normal again" "things are getting better" "I can be happy now" but these phrases have no effect and i still feel sad even though i know life is getting better.
I cant stop thinking to myself and i keep repeating all this ,i can distract myself and stop this by playing video games but when i talk to someone i like i repeat all this in my head thinking maybe if i say this i wont be so clingy.
 What should i do now ,should i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist ,is this some acute form of depression ?
how do i feel better now or at least feel or be normal again 
 Any help would be appreciated and thanks in advance
