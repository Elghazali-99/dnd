I am a 32-year old male, married with 5 children (yes, they're all mine from the same marriage).  I have a history of methamphetamine abuse during my later teens and a relapse about 5 years ago for about 6 months.  Since then, I have tried to "control" my life problems by self medicating in various ways (beer, Vicodin, Adderall, benzos, etc.), keeping it all "legal" and (mostly) as prescribed to not be "abusing" anything.  Fortunately, it's all been without incident.
 I know that won't last.
 My major issues are anxiety, ADHD, and depression from life's frustrations.  I abuse stimulants when I get an Rx for them, but they are all that keep my functioning normally.  Depression meds help the anxiety, but they make me tired.  I recently started taking Strattera, but so far it makes me dizzy and drowsy.
 Is there anything that is indicated for giving you a little "pep in life's step" that isn't abused?  Caffiene makes me angry and scattered.  I want to try something like Wellbutrin, but I don;t want to tell my doc that I abuse stuff because I don;t want to blow my chances with getting "things" that help occasionally.  The downside is he thinks it's all ADHD (hence the Strattera).  Meanwhile, I am trying to find something that helps.
 Anyone help is appreciated...
