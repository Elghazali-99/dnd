Hi,I tend to get devasted continuously for the last many years over my husband not wanting me and repeatedly seeking divorce citing our bad quarrels.I get totally devasted and life stops for me.I feel somehow I have to talk to him and just request him to support me in starting a happy life fresh and not unwanting me again.But today I feel so weak and devastated.My parents and siblings are greatly being devasted by my depression and foremost by desire to be with my husband and not things be over finally between us. often feel like parents are for a lifetime so is the relation with my husband.I am from *****.I met my husband  at the age of **in college.He propesed me and said would marry me.But soon after we started quarreling over issues like he wanting to drink more and be with his friends.And he started lying to me.Based on my culture and young mind then ,I did not know anything like breaking up, I thought this is for a life time, and however bad he is I should be with him.I got so depressed from then only that I used to shout like maniac.In two years time while graduating,he lied to me for something .That was the limit, i HAD SEEN HIM AVOIDING AND IGNORING ME ALWAYS and now lying to me was too much to bear.I asked him to marry me as I really wanted to know if he was fooling around with me.In sometime he  did agree and we got married at the age of 21.Fights continued and parents got to know about it when we were graduating and that too in a very bad manner.My family got us married socially but his parents were not that much in support for us.All were scared.Especially my husband was always against me.Quarrels never stopped.This went for another one and half year and after a bad quarrel he left me.I was devastated totally but somehow my parents supported me.Initially there family asked for divorce but may be because I pleaded with them they did not send a divorce paper.For 4 years he did not contact me.I kept on blaming myself that all because I am very ill tempered he had to leave me .But often wondered did he never see at the same time I really always wanted to be with him and always was there in all situation.After 4 years I myself asked him to finally separate as he would not contact me..In these 4 years he was free enough to talk to all his colleagues and school girl friends.Whereas I was too devastated to ever think of life beside him.Only when he did not contact me for a long time I had thought that I would start my life fresh.But again after 1 year old drama he agreed to be back with me on the condition that I have CHANGED .This was very sad.Why did I have to change.Yet we came back together.Lived for another 2 and half years till date.There were enough number of quarrels over the same issue.Over his drinking etc.....But now again he is adamant he does not want to be with me.He says,I fooled him,convinced him to be with him......This is all sick.His family is also supporting him to separate from me.Though I have written a letter to his uncle that I cannot take this injustice anymore.Why have I been left three times and now he wants to leave citing quarrels as reason.I am not a commodity.My husband is so adamant he does not talk to me properly, he insults me on phone.I love him and want to spend my life with him.I told him that my only fault is I am very short tempered but I do take care of him otherwise.But nothing goes into his head again.I feel very depressed.It has been 11 years now.And I will not be able take all this separation **** again.Especially with the thought that it is my quarrel because of which we are separating.I just want him to accept me as his wife with dignity and acceptance and stop treating me like a peiece of cloth that can be changed.I have left my job am back with my parents now.Not able to study or do anything now.
