I've been taking Citalopram for a few years, but have been in the process of withdrawing for much of that time: I had slowly reduced the dosage from 40mg/day to c.2mg/day (not, of course, precisely 2mg, since I'm dividing/... the tablet 20 times). But when I stop that dosage [it seems like it should be an insignificant amount], I eventually experience panic and disturbed sleep. Do you have any idea if that could be a withdrawal effect or if that small amount of medication could be treating the panic?
A few months ago I started experiencing "over-stimulation" [after all the time I've been taking, and considering the smallness of the dosage of, the medication]. When I tried some Escitalopram that I had left over (I was taking it prior to Citalopram), I didn't experience the "over-stimulation". Could the "over-stimulation" be due to the R-enantiomer [: of course, part of Citalopram, but removed to leave only the S-enantiomer in Escitalopram]?
I'd very much appreciate any suggestions?
