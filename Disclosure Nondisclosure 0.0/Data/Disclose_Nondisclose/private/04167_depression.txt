I dont want to make this long, just to give a little backround, I was on pain pills for like 6 months before my spinal fusion, basically after surgery (Aug 08) after all said and done, I was on 3-oqy 80's a day, plus some breakthrough. In Nov.08 I went to a pain Dr. to get off all the pills, and he put me on Fentanyl  100mm. I thought this was GREAT, I felt good, and I no longer was taking pills, well before I knew it I could not go the 3-day to change the patch, I would WD on the 2nd day, so he told me to change it on the 2nd day, instead of the 3rd, well not long before I couldnt go 2-day's without a little WD, so the Dr. upped the MM top 125. After a while after that, I knew something was just not right, and this patch was running my life. Bottom line is, I went in and demanded to get off of EVERYTHING, so after over a year of alot OF oxy's, the patch etc, he took me off within 2 weeks. Needless to say I went through the WORST time of my life.  I went to my primary Dr, and She put me on 10mg of perc.2 times a day for a month-1/2, then down to 5mg for a month, now I'm completely off (Over a month clean) This has been the toughest thing I have EVER been through. About 3-4 weeks after feeling decent.....I got hit with MAJOR depression, and went to my primany Dr, and she put me on Lexapro, I have been on that for a month now, and WOW, I stiff feel like I'm still majorly depressed, and CANNOT deal with this anymore. I was thinking about some amino acid's, but not sure by reading this form if I can take them because of the Lexapro. I can no longer take this empty, no energy, not happy feeling. Before all this, I was a extremely happy person, with a AWESOME life. I sure hope you guys can help me here.  Thanks, Rich
