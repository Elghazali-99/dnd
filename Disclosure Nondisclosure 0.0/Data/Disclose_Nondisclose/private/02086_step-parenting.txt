Im in a relationship for the last 6 months, all went well, we have passionate relationship, we like and love each other very much, im totally over the moon ! he is a single father with 13 years old girl and im a single mom with 2 teenager boys.  For the past 2 months, i have been introduced with his daughter, went out together 3 of us, for different fun activities.  the girl is extremely sweet t me and completey father's babygirl.  I noticed from the very beginning, my boyfriend care too much of her, everything about her, most important and so on and so on.  Which i dont mind in the beginning. For example, when he is with me relaxing on the couch he would come to her quick and ak if she wants to eat or eat something, i mean she is 13 ! her mom is living in the same city but for some reason she stays with her father, they divorced with mutual agreement for already over 4 years.  My boyfriend and his ex have a very good relationship, which i dont mind at all.  Just couple of days ago we went to cinema, my boyfriend and his daughter, of course he would sit in the middle and his hand is holding mind all the time.  but noticed later on that the other side he holded his daughter's as well, or sometimes just their on his daughter's lap.  I found it really strange ! then once in a while he would stroke her back just like he did to me sometimes ! Im not sure if i overreacted or something, i found it abit too much.  Any thought guys ?
