I'm a middle schOol preteen and I think I have depression....I've been cutting myself just to feel something I want to die so bad my family goes to church and learns about god. I keep thinking hell can't be as bad as life is now....I think my depression started when I was in the 5th grade I got into a big fight with a friend and I started to cut myself ...later on the depression lessens but soon when I hit summer it grew back because my family was going through troubles....my siblings hate me....I don't feel safe....school is suffocatin me my mom yells at me 24/7 my dad died a few weeks before the depression started I feel like I'm locked in a cage and I can't get out, everyday trying to convince myself that I'm not apart of this world . Everyone is trying to tell me to live in reality . There is no reality in my eyes. I want to die Im cutting so much now.....it hurts less and less and I'm doing it more often...I might as well bleed myself to death.....I only have this 1 friend who understands me and listens to me...I have other friends but I'm not truthful to them they cant c through me....I just want to die I hate life so much....help me Please please....if I decide to die I'm going to make sure the world hates me so that no one will miss me .... I want to die I feel hopeless :( please someone help me ....
