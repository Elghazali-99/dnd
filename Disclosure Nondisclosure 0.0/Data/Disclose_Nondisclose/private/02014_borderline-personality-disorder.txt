This is about my 35 year old brother. I just can not put him in a category of any of these mental or personality disorders, therefore I don't know how to address the problem. He was married and divorced, has three young children. Cheated on the first with the new one. Was set to get married again and the fiance called it off that morning! He lies about everything. He steals money, potentially alot. He gets a good job, then he looses it. He has anger issues with my mom and his fiance, and others. He has to be the center of attention at parties, everybody who doesn't know him well thinks hes a great guy. He spends money like crazy, which he doesn't have. He is 25,000.00 behind on child support and keeps getting arrested by the sheriff to collect the money. He now has no job, no insurance, no car, no place to live. My sisters and I and my mom and dad have done so much for him over the years we just can't do it anymore. He is visiting my Aunt and I'm afraid he is going to try to steal from her to get home. What is his problem. There is something wrong mentally. Bi-polar?
