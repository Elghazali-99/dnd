I was with my ex boyfriend for about 2 years....we broke up in march of 09' so almost a year ago.  it wasn't even a break up.  i was pregnant and he slashed me with a 12 inch machete and then almost choked me to death.  He went to jail and a restraining order was put in effect immediately.  I lost the baby.  I never talked to him after that night and only saw him in court and here and there around the county i live in (i hide when i see him) i am petrified of him.  He also broke my nose in three places and shattered my cheek bone amongst tons of other incidences i don't feel like re-hashing.   i also became heavily addicted to pain pills during our relationship because i had to have many surgeries to fix all the damage he was doing to my body. Anyway i am 46 day clean of pills.  after we broke up i was a mess for a while and in counseling a program called advocates against victims of assault.  i went to group sessions and a couple of individual ones for 3 or 4 months.  and i felt better and moved on or thought i did.  the thing is i can't stop thinking about him and i wake up in the middle of the night remembering him hitting me.  i am in a cold sweat and hyper ventilating.  and sometimes i lay in bed at night and feel my face and my nose and remember the night he closed fist punched me in the face and how scary it was and i can't sleep.
 i also have not been able to get close to any man since my ex.  i have dated guys or i should say guys have tried to date me unsuccessfully.  i just end up pushing them away.  and it's not because i am scared they will hurt me....this is the totally screwed up part....it's because i cannot love them like i loved him.  it's not that we will ever get back together or that i want to or anything like that....like i said we don't even talk anymore, it's just because of the way that i loved him.
 am i going to be alone forever?  what is wrong with me?  any advice is welcomed?
