I was repeatedly and regularly sexually abused from the ages of one to six.  I was molested and raped.  The abuse was horrible and violent.  My attacker was my step-father who told me in graphic detail all the horrible things he would do to my mother if I ever spoke out.  To prove it he shoved my mother's hand onto a hot element on the stove right in front of me when I was four.  
 Now I'm all grown up and I'm doing all the right things.  I have talked to the police.  I talked to my doctor.  I'm on an anti-depressant, I go to therapy for two years now.  I love away from home and have a good support system.  
 The problem is I can't have a relationship.  I cannot trust a man.  I can not be touched.  I am still angry and I cannot let go.  I hurt all the time.  I think the smallest joke means someone is a potential abuser.  I cannot have sex.  I cannot even come close and I am still a sexual person and want to be able to have sex.  
 I just want to not be robbed of a good adulthood because I was robbed of a good childhood.  Please, please help.
