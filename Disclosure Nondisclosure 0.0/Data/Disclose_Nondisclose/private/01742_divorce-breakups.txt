The divorce was my choice (no infidelity involved on either side) and I have been struggling with thoughts and feelings ever since. Just a few weeks after I told him I wanted the divorce he was in touch with another woman and has been with her ever since. I feel as though the 20 years of our relationship was diminished by replacing it so easily.  I don't know if I need to have a relationship and so I'm looking back (although I'm forcing myself to move forward) but I am really hurting. I find myself thinking about the good things that we had and did and why I was with him in the first place, and I have to remind myself of the reasons that led to my wanting a divorce and the ugly things that happened in the months following. I admit that I am jealous that his life just moved forward and I'm forcing mine to move forward. Nothing feels natural. Even when I'm with my kids or grandkids there is an emptiness inside. I find my mind wandering back to "if he was here" or "I wonder what he's doing now." I wanted the divorce but it's harder than I thought it would be. It's making me miserable!!! HELP!!!!!
