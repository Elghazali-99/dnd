I started college this fall and I noticed very quickly I was starting to fall behind. I did my best to try and reach out for support before I started to fail academically. But I was not good enough. My depression as of late has been very bad. I had it under control fairly well for a long time, but I guess the stress of college work, dealing with new people, moving far from home, and the normal ups and downs of depression got the better of me. It was a fairly difficult decision but I've decided that I need to take a leave and come back next year when I'm better. Obviously during the leave I'll be continuing CBT, but I wanted to take on something that would help to prepare me academically for school too. I'm not a hundred percent sure what option are open for me. What kinds of things like internships, jobs, organizations would you recommend for me? I'm a pretty good writer, okay musician, fantastic actor (This is what I was going to college for, also you are just gonna have to take my word for it.) I'm interested in anything from helping those in need to just working with some company for the experience. I just don't know the kinds of things available or where to look for them. Close to Upstate New York would be nice but it isn't necessary. What do you suggest?
