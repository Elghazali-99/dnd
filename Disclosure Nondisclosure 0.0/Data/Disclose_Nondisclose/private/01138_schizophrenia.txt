I have taking seroquel xr 500 mg and risperadle 1mg from long. Medicine is not working around 5%. I was studying programming but I am stopped cause I can't take inputs I mean i cannot study on computer but i don't want to try other medicine and I won't increase the medicine either.  I was 85 kg 1 years before, now 86 kg. I am going to try seroquel 400 mg and risperadle 2 mg. I think something wrong going in my body. And i think my brain is also getting sick. May be i need a enough madness. It's so hard disease. I used to think if i take enough doze of medicine, take bath everyday and do physical work will balance me but some percent is not good. The main problem is coming when i take input. When i study on computer or try to remember codes i go psyco later. Does studying produce poison on brain?When happy or laugh i feel stress free , thus i do joking on work ,and talk lots of idiots. When i laugh my brain feels really comfortable. My be brain produce good hormone when laughing. When i worry, angry, that time huge amount of poison produces then i got huge strong wave which makes me stress and then i go psyco or started to think and communicate with something. I try to answer within brain cause makes me curious. So some day i do whole day thinking and next day feel relax. My biggest question is how to study, how to go psyco, come out from psyco and go into psyco. cause i cannot pay hospital bill to go in hospital and go mad there. They send me 50000 dollar bill at first. I did not pay. Next thing mental illness is life time like this. If i wait tomorrow i will be ok and i will study , that never gonna happen, The main challenge is how to go psyco safely as well as study side by side.
