ok so this is really hard for me to write this and sry if i misspell i have talked to alot of ppl about this and they all feel the same way i do but i need some advise on how to handle the situation im in so heres the thing thats going on and i apoligize now for it being long
  ok so i have a 3yr old daughter and her father and i have never lived together but we did date up until she was about 1 1/2 we have always lived over 100 miles away from eachother he was never interested in moving in even though we dated for 5yrs we also only had intercourse 1 time and that is when we conceived r daughter 
  ok so when we would go and stay at his place for about a wk he would help me with her change her diaper and sometimes feed her but he ALWAYS wanted to change her diaper well i never thought anything of it until i started noticing it took him awhile to change it an he would always take her in his room so 1 day i went to go see what was taking so long cause it had been almost half hr well i noticed his bedroom door closed i opened it and i walked in on him bending over with her laying on the bed and him gently blowing (like blowing bubbles r smoke) around her private i asked what he was doin he said he was drying her off i was speachless i asked him y he was doin it that way he told me he thought thats what he was suppost to do 
  ok so we get home and she screams when i went to change her diaper and i also noticed she was red i didnt know if it was an infection r what so i called her doc by the time she got her in she was no longer red so everytime she seen her dad from newborn (yes newborn) she has had night terrors this diaper thing happened when she was a few months old so i after seeing him do that told him he no longer changes her diaper unless someone was around him cause if he thought that was normal to do i didnt know what else he thought was ok so he still wanted to change her diaper an 1 day he was laying on his stomach with his face close to her changing a poopy diaper i said something an he told me i needed to stop criteqing his parenting skills and let him do it the way he wants to well then i noticed he always has to hold her an touch her at 1 1/2 he wanted to take a bath with her even though she didnt need one hes to big for a bath tub and he was naked and the 5 yrs hes always taken showers i asked him were in the tub she was going to be an he said on his lap i put a stop to it quick so i decided that even though we was broken up that i wasnt going to keep them away from eachother so i am still driving over 100miles staying a wk r 2 at his place but not letting him be alone with her but she still is having night terrors but when we r at home for a few days she slept 
  ok so jumping ahead alittle so child support goes after him cause this whole time hes not paying anything im on disability and he wasnt helping me much with her and she was almost 2 so he decides to go after me for joint custody unsupervised an writes me telling me its cause thats the only way to get the child support lowered well since then now i no longer go to his place he comes here 1 day a wk for 6 hrs me supervising he has taken her to the bathroom i walked in while she was standing facing him an he was forcing his hand between her legs telling me it was to wipe her even though 30 min before that he stood in br while i took her watched an seen i handed her the toilet paper to wipe herself so there is the famouse words i thought i was suppost to  well after that i wouldnt let him out of my site and for 2 months she stopped having uncontrolled fits clingging to me didnt mind seeing him we pretty much had her potty trained and she was waking me up at night to go potty and besides going potty she was sleeping through the night 
  one day we got into a fight cause after she hit him he told her no she went to do it again he took the toy she had a fit he wanted to pick her up i told him no shes throwing a fit cause she got in trouble well he wouldnt listen it turned in to a big fight and well we started talking about the things hes done inapropriate i read him 13 different things i found he did that was not rite his comment was u could prob add a dozen more i was shocked i asked what he was talkin about he responded with i havent had the chance to do anything else ive been getting watched well of course i told him to leave before i did something well i called him and he told me he meant to say he hasnt had the chance to take her to see his parents what kind of response is that when ur talking about inapropriate behavior u have done to ur child o an not to mention he also said he sees nothing wrong with any of what he has done 
 he sees my daughter 1 day a wk me supervising in public my lawyer said since we r in public he cant do anything to her so give him his alone time well i have done that and he talks to her she is back to having night mares and back to wearing pull ups and going in them shes also back to clinging to me an she screams that she doesnt want to go when i say its time to go see him but on other days she wants to go somewere but shes always happy to see him but when i say its time to go home she goes by dad an wants to hurry an leave i asked her 1 day what they talk about and she goes shhhhhh i dont know what that means but thats all she said 
  ok so here it is its been over a yr since ive been fighting to wear he doesnt get overnight r even unsupervised days cause i dont feel he didnt know that wasnt the rite thing to do i asked him if he ever seen me r anyone else dry a baby that way he said no i asked y he did he said i dont know anyways i have to be around him not say anything an bite my tounge and act nice to him while i see him touching my baby seeing her having these emotional effects an she had the emotional probs before i felt this way towards him but does anyone have any advise is this just me being overly protective of my baby r is there a reason i have to keep fighting i feel i need to protect her what do i do and how can i help her get through the visits how can i get through the visits he dont want anyone else he dont want a professinal he only wants a family mem of his r me but no one can go with me except get this one my ex husband he wont allow anyone else an its even in the court papers my moms not allowed
