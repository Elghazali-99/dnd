THIS GIRL I KNOW SHE WALKS A LONE IT ISN'T COLD BUT IT IS DARK, THEIRS SO MANY MISSING PIECES TO HER HEART. SHE HAS DEEP DEEP SCARS THAT MAY NEVER HEAL SHE WISHES THEY WEREN'T THERE BUT THE PAIN SHE FEELS MAKES THEM REAL. SHE CAN'T HELP BUT GO BACK TO THE PAIN SHE FEELS EVERYDAY, KNOWING THESE SCARS WONT EVER FADE OR GO AWAY, SHE HAS NOTHING, SHE IS LOST AND A LONE, HAS NO PLACE SHE CAN CALL HOME. SHE FEELS FAR AWAY FROM ANYTHING SHE TOUCHES, NO FEEL OF REALITY MAKES HER FEEL NAUSEOUS. SOMETIMES THE PILLS HELP BUT THEY NEVER MAKE IT STOP, SHES WAITING FOR THE TIME TO BE OVER AS SHE SOMETIMES WATCHES THE CLOCK, WONDERING WHEN THE TIME IS SHE'LL BE SET FREE, NO LONGER HURT NO LONGER EMPTY.  SHE CRIES ALMOST EVERYDAY, SHE LETS HER DAYS JUST SLIP AWAY. SHE LIGHTS UP A CIGARETTE TO TRY TO RELAX, BUT AS SOON AS IT BURNS OUT HER HURT COMES BACK. WHY ME? SHE ALWAYS SAYS, ASKING HERSELF QUESTIONS SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE ANSWERS TOO, SO SOMETIMES SHE'LL REACH OUT FOR YOU. 
BUT WHAT CAN YOU REALLY DO? WHEN THAT PAIN DOESN'T LIVE INSIDE OF YOU? THEY SCOLD HER TO EAT, TO GET A JOB, TO GET A LICENSE, THEY THINK SHE'S SPOILED, MOST CALL HER A SNOB, BUT SHE KNOWS THEY WOULDN'T IF THEY KNEW THE PAIN THAT WAS INVOLVED. BUT SHE DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING OR TRY TO FIGHT BACK, REACHING OUT IT SOMETIMES WHAT SHE LACKS. THEY DON'T KNOW OF HER PROBLEMS, THEY DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN SHE JUST PLACES HER HEAD ON HER HANDS AND SOBS. SHE WANTS TO RUN AWAY BUT KNOWS THE PAIN WILL FOLLOW LIVING TODAY NOT KNOWING OF TOMORROW, AND SOMETIMES US OUTSIDERS MAY FIND THE BEAUTY IN OUR SORROW, I FEEL A STRENGTH BUILDING ME UP, AND A WISH GRANTED A WISH OF LUCK, TO LIVE, TO BREATHE, TO HELP ME SEE, THAT I WANT TO BE HERE AND FIGHT FOR YOU FOR ME. ON THE NEWS ANOTHER SUICIDE TODAY, JUST THINKING I WISH THAT I COULD HAVE SAVED. JUST ONE LIFE, JUST ONE PERSON, IT WOULD ALL BE SO MUCH MORE WORTH IT.  I WANT TO LIVE TO HELP, AND PRAY AND MAKE SURE I GET OUT AS MUCH HELP AS I CAN EVERYDAY, IN EVERY WAY. TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING WILL BE OK. YOUR BEAUTIFUL NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, WE ALL WANT LOVE, AND IT'S NOT THAT FAR, JUST REACH OUT AND YOU WILL RECEIVE YOU CAN GIVE YOURSELF EVERYTHING YOU NEED. LOVE YOURSELF , AND BE TRUE TO YOU,  DON'T WORRY ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE DOUBT YOU, JUST DO AS YOU DO. LIVE YOUR LIFE NOT IN FEAR , BUT IN AN OPTIMISTIC MIND THAT YOU NEED TO BE HERE, YOU WERE SENT HERE FOR A REASON, AND SOMETIMES THAT REASON IS HARD TO BELIEVE IN, BUT SOMEONE LOVES YOU , AND SOMEONE LOOKS UP TO YOU, AND NO MATTER HOW YOU TRY TO PUSH SOMEONE AWAY YOUR TO BEAUTIFUL TO GIVE UP PLEASE PLEASE STAY.
