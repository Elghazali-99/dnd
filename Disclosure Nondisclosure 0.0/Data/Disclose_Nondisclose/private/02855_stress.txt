I am 22 years old. I am a mother of 3 kids.. 2 boys and a girl. My daughter is 3 years old she was premature born with severe brain damage, doctors have yet to diagnose her with a particular disorder, she doesn't communicate very well, she has to have speech and occupational therapy. Her learning pace is very slow, my 2 year old son has by passed her on alot of levels. Well I am stressed and dont handle my stress very well I may say. I am a sahm I live with my boyfriend (father of my 3 kids) and I have 2 kids at home with me 24-7, my oldest son is attending pre-k. My mother died in 2006 and she was like my best friend, I took her death very diffuicult. Im not over it by any means I cry often about it but i dont talk about her,  her death and my feelings very often because I tend to hear the same things over and over that she wouldnt want me to be sad or crying etc. As a child I had to defend myself to my step father because he was verbally, physically and sexualy abusive to me. Lately my boyfriend and I have been going through alot of issues he feels I have given up on alot of my normal duties and to be honest I have for the simple fact that I feel like I have no help and im stressed out. I dont know what to do to ease my stress level down so I can be a little happier and more relaxed. Any Advice?
