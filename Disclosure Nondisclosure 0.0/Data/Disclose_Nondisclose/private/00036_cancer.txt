I have vulvar Bowen's disease and Squamous Cell Carcinoma. I am negative for all HPV high and low risk. Pap is good. My margins were not clear so I have had 2 minor surgeries and am waiting for a 2nd opinion on my slides and news on margins.  I am concerned because my glands have become tender in my groin, armpit and neck since biopsy. I have been put on antibiotics.  The Dermatologist says I have probably been exposed to Arsenic many years ago. My Father also had Bowen's and Melanoma. My brother has recently had a melanoma. So when I found this painless, flat lavender spot on me I rushed to the Doctor. I had to insist to have it off. It has been 16 days since my first biopsy.  If my margins are not clear I am being referred to a Onc Gyne for further treatment. I was told I will have to be checked every 3 months.
 It looks lke there was an elevated arsenic level in the water table where I grew up. I am 55. What I read on exposures is that it takes decades for the effects to show up.......what is your feeling on this?
 My Father had Bowen's. The Derm says it is more likely enviormental than genetic?  He had numerous melanomas but they were all caught early. He also had bladder cancer, lymphoma and died from liver cancer from metast Melanoma.  I have been healthy other that developing Hashimoto's and a multinodular goiter 2 years ago. I also had shingles 2 years ago.
 Any ideas or suggestions?  Oleander
