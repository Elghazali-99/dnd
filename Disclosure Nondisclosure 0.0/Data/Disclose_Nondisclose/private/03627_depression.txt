Hello,
 I am 21 years old. I lost my mother on mother's day this year (May 11, 2014). I am married but my husband works and I feel so lonely. I go to college, but I feel like I cannot deal with school, my mind is not straight. I have two brothers and one sister. My older brother and sister have their little family. My other brother and his girlfriend lives with my husband and I. September 18th, 2014 I found out I was pregnant, but early this month (October) I found out I was having a ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is when the baby is growing out of the uterus. I had to get a shot to stop the pregnancy. I have been feeling so alone lately, I feel like nobody cares, nobody really listens to me. I pray to God, I just hope things can just be like old times. Sometimes I wish it was just my mother and I like good old times. But I know I cannot take time back.
 I just don't know what to do anymore I feel like I cannot take it anymore :'( :'( :'(
 My mother was my everything and without her I just can't live a normal life.
I just wish she was here so I can tell her my problems, so she can hug me tight and give me advice.
Nothing is the same anymore !! :'( :'( :'(
