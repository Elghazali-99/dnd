Hello all, I am a 17 year old girl and lately I have been feeling what I think may be depression. I'm never happy anymore and I cry all the time, sometimes for no reason at all. I have been informed by a counsellor that i have an adolescent anxiety disorder that is pretty bad. (panic attacks, tapping fingers, biting nails, twitching and throwing up when I get nervous etc.) It doesn't help at all that my parents have me enrolled in a competitive all girls private school where I get barely any interaction with friends out of school (they come from hours away to go to this school and all live far away) I am however popular within my school amongst my peers and I have a good relationships with my parents who both know I am upset lately. I also never go out or get to spend time with my family anymore because homework and test studying is so intense ( I'm talking about 6 hours a night on average if not more homework and quiz wise plus test studying. I also tutor after school and go to a language school on Saturdays so my life= all school and I'm tired of it. I'm not allowed to date, so I had to turn down a boy recently because my dad says I can't date until university and he will not let me interact with boys. I feel that between school and being surrounded by girls all the time I am missing out on the highschool experience I should be getting. I think that I have been rushed to grow up and I just want to be a kid but I just don't feel like doing anything fun anymore. Please help.
