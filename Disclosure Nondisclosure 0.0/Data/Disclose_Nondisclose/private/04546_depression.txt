I recently experienced a vivid memory of feelings that I experienced in my childhood - feelings/experiences of rejection by a depressed older sibling (nobody knew she was depressed at the time; we recently found out that she may have been depressed for quite some time. we are now in our twenties). I had totally forgotten about those experiences, but since that day I revisited those memories, I've been experiencing feelings of sadness that I can't find a real reason for (though I know it's probably related to those memories). When I'm around people, I feel cheerful, but when I'm alone, like in the car, I suddenly feel empty and sad and I just want to stay alone. 
Before I remembered these things about my childhood, I had been feeling consistently really great and optimistic. Things are going really well in my life and I have nothing to complain about, but I feel so strangely sad and empty whenever I'm alone. It's frustrating. I want to tell my friends, but at the same time, I really don't want to talk about it, because I know I wouldn't be able to give a substantial reason for how I'm feeling. I feel awkward when a close friend asks me how I'm doing, because there's nothing wrong - I'm just sad. 
 I don't want to be too quick to label this as "depression," and I know it's much too early to even think about it. It's only been five days since I've been feeling this way. I already did research on depression symptoms, so I know I'm not depressed. I don't need a diagnosis or anything. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I should to? For now I am waiting it out, but I was wondering if it is heard of for things like this to be triggered by minor, non-traumatic childhood memories.
