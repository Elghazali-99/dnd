I have many, many reasons for having stress, but a few top the list.  First, I have been having a lot of medical issues lately and between upsetting diagnosis and medical bills and just feeling bad and hurting all the time it is starting to wear me down.  I have been diagnosed with UCTD (Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease) which, from what I am being told, is probably a pre-cursor to being diagnosed with Lupus and/or other auto-immune diseases.  I have too many symptoms to list all of them here, but here are a few:
 Muscle and joint pain, muscle spasms, CFS leak, muscle atrophy, headaches, heel pain, neck and back pain, acid reflux, gastritis, esophogitis, hiatal hernia, swollen joints, insomnia and many more. 
 My rheumatologist tells me my pcp is an idiot and my pcp says the same about the rheumy.  Both keep collecting healthy sums for basically doing nothing.  Which leads to cause number 2 for stress, finances.  In addition to the office visits themselves, I have to miss work for each appointment, then there are the tests and the medication.  Now I also have a gastroenterologist added into the mix.
 Add to that the emotional and financial impact of Hurricane Ike (I live in Galveston County, Texas) and the stress of dealing with 2 insurance companies, the past due bills and the stock market sucking our 401K dry, then my daughter lost her home to the hurricane so she and her husband and 2 small kids moved in for nearly a month.  I dearly love the grandbabies and my daughter, but the addition of 4 people, two of whom are VERY active, has wreaked havoc on my home, not to mention my sanity.
 Then there is work!  I can't even begin to describe that issue.  Suffice it to say that it is a primary cause of stress in my life.
 Thanks to all of the above, I am pretty much at my wits end. How do people cope with so many stressful situations at once?  Please don't suggest another doctor, I am about doctored to death as it is!
