I am trying to figure out if my co-worker is being abused. I know she had a very abusive childhood. She's been married for over 30 years, she got married at 17. Anway, she is very paranoid and insecure. She seems to think that we are all out to get her. She refuses to participate in any deparmental functions yet complains that we exclude her.  She has to have control over absolutely everything. If anything is moved on her desk she will go off.  She doesn't have any physical signs, like cuts and bruises so I would suspect if anything she's being emotional abused. I looked up the symptons of domestic abuse but it didn't really hep because I don't know her husband and I don't talk to her very often. Talking to her usually ends up in argument because she thinks that you are telling her she can't do her job.  She's managed to alienate herself from everyone. I don't know if she's being abuse or if her behavior is a result of her traumatic childhood. 
I really want to help, she is  obviously very unhappy but I don't know what to do.
