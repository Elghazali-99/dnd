In July 24, 2013, my mum was diagnosed with multiple intracranial metastases.
Chest CT: left dorsal segment lesions
 In August 5, 2013,she had stereotactic biopsy and head gamma knife treatment
Pathology: poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma
diagnosis: the forth phase of left lung adenocarcinoma with brain metastases,
           EGFR gene mutations
after surgery,she took IRESSA for 6 months.
 In August 13, 2013,she had Gamma Knife treatment of pulmonary.
(surgery in detail as follows:  one lesion, 55% isodose curves, dose: 4.0Gy * 11f)
 In September 5, 2013,she had whole brain radiotherapy :200cGy/f, 5f/w, DT 3600cGy. 
  In May 5, 2014, head enhanced MRI: multiple metastases can be found in her fourth periventricular and leptomeningeal. some of the lesions in cerebral parenchyma become bigger, some become smaller.
 In May 20, 2014 and June 24, 2014. she had chemotherapy: Gemcitabine & carboplatin
 In July 1st,2014, head enhanced MRI: multiple enhanced nodules can be seen in bilateral cerebral hemispheres(diameter : less than 10mm). around some lesions,there is some tissue edema signal.one bigger lesion is inside of the right frontal lobe. abnormal enhancement can be seen in cerebellar hemispheres and bilateral frontal and temporal lobe leptomeningeal . The choroid fissure has long T1&T2 hyperintenseno signal(size: 12mm). No midline shift.
 Pathology Report：
date: July 4th ,2014 
diagnosis: Lung adenocarcinoma metastasis to the brain 
gene mutation:Exon-19M1(gene deletion), Exon-19M2(gene deletion), Exon-20 T790M
 she is now in confusion, often gives irrelevant answers. eating and sleepling are ok, normal excretion.
