Hi all, Ive just found out I have BPD and waiting  (not very paciently) for therapy. Researching all I can. Reading others perspectives on this afliction- it really saddens me to know so many others feel the extreme sensitivity and 'over awareness' that I do. My heart goes out to all of you and selfishly I draw relief from knowing Im not the only one. Can anyone advise me on my situation... does anyone else experience similar to this: Im totally inconsistant... Im an artist yet find it so hard to conclude a painting... I change my mind- Im obsessive or indifferent, compulsive-its almost impossible to complete an idea. Sometimes I just feel blank or have to have a drink to get started or feel enthusiasm. The sad thing is Ive had shows and won a couple of awards, I have a Masters degree and trained at the RCA and next year Ive got more shows lined up with a gallery interested and I still feel worthless and petrified. I feel I might kill myself trying to produce the work. Does anyone else have this kind of problem? and have they found a cure???Exhausted! Hugs and Thanks K
