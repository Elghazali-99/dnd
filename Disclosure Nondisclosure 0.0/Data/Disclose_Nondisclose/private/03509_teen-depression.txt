Okay, so what I need to ask is how to tell my parents about my depression. I think I have had dysthymic depression since about the age of 8 (I'm currently 16) but I've kept it well hidden, no-one knows there's anything wrong.
I want to seek help but I don't know how to.
As far as I can guess my parents reaction is either going to be supportive or they will be in denial. They have their own problems themselves so I feel I'll be a burden if I tell them.
I don't feel I can tell my friends either, they're both dealing with some very stressful problems and I don't want to add to them.
The of course there's the stigma of depression, what if I'm rejected by all my friends and family because of what I am?
I need to know how to break it to them without them rejecting me, and will they believe me? I've hidden it so well that they might not think it's true or that i'm attention seeking. Even if they do I don't want them to be ashamed of what I am.
Please help I need to tell someone about this.
Thank-you,
