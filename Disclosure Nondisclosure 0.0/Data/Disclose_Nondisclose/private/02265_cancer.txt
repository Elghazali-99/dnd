I completed my first colonoscopy about a week ago.  A nodule was found in the rectum and results came back with one Nodule, 10 cm from the anus, submucosal, solid, moveable, 8mm.  The gastroenterologist that did my colonoscopy did not call and explain anything to me; rather, his receptionist called to let me know that I needed to schedule a follow-up appointment over a week out.  So, this past week has been hell!  I've been trying to learn as much as I can about this diagnosis, causing me so much confusion and it's scaring me to death!  I have anxiety issues anyway and this is taking them to a whole new level.  My questions are:
 1.  How common is it for this type of rectal nodule to spread?  
2.  Is it common to have more nodules in the GI tract?  I do not have Carcinoid Syndrome symptoms.
3.  What test(s) will be run when I go to a gastro at a highly regarded University Health Care on Tuesday afternoon?
4.  The pathology report doesn't have any details about the results of the biopsy, only the Final Diagnosis.  Is this normal?  Gross Description:  Received in zinc-formalin is a 0.1 cm x 0.1 cm x 0.1 cm red-tan soft tissue fragment.  Totally Submitted.  Sections:  A1-1.  RR:ta 
5.  How serious is this diagnosis?
 Any information that you can share regarding this diagnosis would be so appreciated.
 Thank you.
