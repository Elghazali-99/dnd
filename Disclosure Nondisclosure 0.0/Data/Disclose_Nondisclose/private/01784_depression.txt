Hi all, I am new to this forum, although I have been lurking for a while to find answers. I will try to make this question short.
 I was diagnosed with severe postpartum depression after my daughter was born in 2010, but nothing has gotten better. I used to have anxiety and impulsive beavhiours when I was in my teens, so this has led me to believe that this isn't something that is going to get better anymore. 
 I feel like I have strong OCD tendencies, but cannot find other people to related to. I don't have your "typical" obsessions so I was wondering what those with OCD thought about my symptoms...
 I check my weight EVERY DAY at the same time, same way, etc.
I have a pregnancy test obesssion and I spend hours looking at pregnancy tests on the internet
I obsess about my mental health and constantly try to find answers online (what brings me here!)
I constantly think I'm pregnant, even though we're using protection, and I continually check by using HPT's when it's clear that pregnancy couldn't have happened that month, etc
 Does anyone else have random thoughts like this? Why hasn't my pdoc diagnosed me with OCD?? (I don't you can't answer that!) This weekend I've had a lot of reoccuring suicidal and homicidal thoughts towards my family...another one of my obsessions. I'm afraid I'm going downhill again, as I'm super sensitive to my feelings/thoughts.
 And just so you know, my current med regime is this:
Pristiq 100mg
Abilify 10mg
Wellbutrin 300mg
 Thanks for reading...
