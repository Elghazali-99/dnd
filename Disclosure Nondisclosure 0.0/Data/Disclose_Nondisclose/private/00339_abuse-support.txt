My first post, but I really need help with an ethical issue. I was hoping for a doctor to respond, but dont exactly want to pay $10. I have a doctor that I want to fry.
 Here's the story, 3 weeks ago I go in for an MRI, it's a new private practice that my primary made me an appointment at. I go in everything is normal, I had a contrast MRI and there was some wait time for another MD to come over and give me the dye injection. The MD that was doing the MRI made conversation with me while I was waiting. It was professional, just about where I work, what I plan do with my life(since I have a BS in Biology, he talks about his practice blah blah blah, just professional. I leave after it's done............
 Next day 10:30pm I get a phone call on my cellphone, says "private call", I don't answer because I don't answer calls like that, no voice mail, nothing. next day same thing at 5pm and 10pm, no voice mail, next day yet another call, no voice ,mail. the day after same thing, but this time there was a message. Hi (my first name), this is (his name),  I was the person that did your MRI the other day, I was wondering if you'd like to go out for a drink or coffee sometime, my number is (cell phone #), bye. 
 Never get a call again, but this seriously disturbs me, for one I'm a young guy(legal age) and he's like 60 and an MD! Oh yeah, and I'm engaged to a beautiful young woman :). This has to be reason to file him against the AMA, but what will most likely come from this? I have the message still, I havent talked to him, besides him sending me a huge bill today. I dont want this happening to other people, but I also dont want some lengthy case that goes no where and leaves me wishing I never brought it to anyones attention.
