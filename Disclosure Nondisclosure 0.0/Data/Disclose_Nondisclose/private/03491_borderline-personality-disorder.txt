Okay. I am an extremely calm person. I think rationally, I never act out, during an argument I always wait for the other person to finish before I speak. But I get these flashes of anger. 
 They last only half of a moment, but they are murderous, blind, seething moments. And they're triggered by the smallest things. My boyfriend uses a wrong word or likes a pretentious movie, my sister makes an innocent joke at my expense, my brother sits next to me. I've never acted on this anger, mostly because it instantly dissolves into mild irritation. I never would ACTUALLY stab my friend for petting the dog wrong, but in that fraction of an instant, I really do want to.
 They literally are too short to even register, so there is no danger of me actually hurting someone. But I do have fairly bad anxiety issues and I wonder if that could be related. Maybe these tiny discomforts are somehow triggering my anxiety. The only thing is it happens entirely randomly and often with people I am very comfortable around.
 It's not common either, it happens maybe once a month, if that. Anyone know what this might be? I can deal with it fine, just a little worried that it may be something medical.
