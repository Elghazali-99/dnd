sorry about the length but please read i need help from someone who knows a good amount about this stuff........ok i feel very stupid because for the past few months i have been scared every single day. i recently have this huge fear of schizophrenia mostly developing it. i am 16 and heard it start in adolesence. i see a therapist and she says it is my anxiety. yes i have anxiety and i find it hard to control. i am always thinking things like "what am i going to do if i start hearing voices or seeing things then i think oh my gosh what if it does happen and i get sent to a mental institution for the rest of my life. i don't want to hear voices or anything like that i wouldn't be able to live with it. i know not all schizophrenics hear voices but it's always the severe cases of that i hear about. i have always been smart and happy very fun and goofy personality. but ths past year has sucked royaly. first my grandma who raised me from birth and was my mother got diagnosed with cancer and passed away in august. then we had to move into a little apartment which i've never lived in an apartment before well at least that i can remember. then my sister got her daughter taken away and we had to go down there to help her out for a week then we came back and out of no where i started getting horrible headaches and i took sudafed and they went away after a week and thats when i got the anxiety. out of no where it just hit me and now i never get out my mind is always preoccupied with thingss that could happen like schizophrenia. and i try to get my mind off of it but it's like my mindrevolves around this thought and i just need someone who knows something to tell me this will not happen no matter how much it scares me it won't happen. i just want to be my old self again before this crappy year started
