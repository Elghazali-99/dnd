I am at a turning point in my short marriage. I have been with my husband almost 7 years but married for under 2 and considering separating now to save both our sanities. I beleive I forced my husband into the marriage by ultimatum and now I feel horrible and will take all the blame for the marriage being as bad as it is....we have grown apart very quickly, we have nothing in common anymore - he is a couch potato and I am fairly active, I have most of the financial responsibility and getting tired of that - when I try and talk about it with him and his lack of shared money its always a fight - even when I was on unemployment insurance, he sat back and watched me struggle to pay bills and take humiliating calls from creditors..I work full time now and looking for more work to get our debts down while he works part time with no intnetion of full time. I have supported this for 7 months now but I cant anymore.
We say hurtful things to each other and neither offering apologies later, the sex ***** when we do have it (every 3 months?). I have not considered an affair, that is too disrespectful but I am at breaking point and this morning I catually called my husband a parasite to which he responded with a barrage of hurtful things including no one likes me thats why I have no friends....can you see where this is going??? He said he will be out of our home this week and I have no idea how I even feel about that. To separate ot not to separate is the question killing me right now....has anyone else been on this brink of separation and was able to turn the marriage around? Ultimatly I would like to but I dont want to beat a dead horse either...
