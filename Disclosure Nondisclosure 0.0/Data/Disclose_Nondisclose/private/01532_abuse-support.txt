Alright so this is more of a question, So I found out my grandfather well he's not my biological grandfather but I knew him my whole life. Okay so back on topic my step grandfather has over like 9 kids by his 1st wife she passed giving child birth then some years later my granny and him were friends for a very very long time he then married my grandmother years later which she already had her 4 kids (my mom,aunt, and two uncles) my "step grandfather" kids and my mom aunt and uncles use to be real close childhood friends. But to get to the point we just found out that he had sex with two of his daughters incest basically and had a baby by one of them. He's disgusting he then went on to say it was "consensual" sex. He said one wasn't a virgin just tried to justify everything he did with his daughters. So his oldest gran-daughter is actually his daughter. This story only gets worst and deeper but what I want to know is can he go to jail now even if it's after like 24 years if they get a DNA which they will find that his oldest gran daughter by his real biological daughter is his? It's also speculation about so much more with him and other kids. I want to know if he can still go to jail.
