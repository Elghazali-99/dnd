Im 16 Years old, and i dont no wether its just Hormones,or wether there is something wrong with me?!
Im constantly sad, i moved out of my moms a year and 4 months ago because i was abused my my moms partner. My mom didnt beleive me, and chose to stay with him and not me. Living with my dad and step mom has been hard becuase i dont fit in very well. unless i am out with friends or with my boyfriend im sad constantly. Untill about 2 months ago, i took everything that made me angry or sad out on my mom. Id fall out with her in spite of what she decided she wanted to do just to make myself feel better. i dont feel bad for doing it. But now i just constantly Miss her. My boyfriend is mentally ill and has anger problems and is a sociopath. Its not always easy for me to understand him, but i no he has come to terms with that and understands that i dont understand him sometimes. He told me that he thought there may have been something wrong with me becuase of my sadness and because being with a sociopath is hard..  but its what i want to do. I find it so hard to talk to people in person about how i feel, but i really want to know what is up with me?
