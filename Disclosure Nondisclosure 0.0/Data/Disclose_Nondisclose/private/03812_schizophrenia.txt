Hi, my cousin is 15 years old i'm worried sick, her anger is what scares me to death it scares everyone so I sat down and caught her in a calm mood and she says when shes angry it feels like its not her, her mind blacks out and all there is to think is violence blood knives dead bodies she often struggles with a strong erg to hurt herself or someone else its on her so bad it stresses her out leaving her to sit away from people and isolate herself from anyone she says she does it because she doesn't want to hurt anyone and has to stay away from ''humans'' I find it odd how she says ''I need to stay away from the humans''.
 She often just sits in silence and looks around and sometimes stares anywhere and not blink for 5 minutes, she says she has strong ergs to throw cutlery everywhere or at people, we was with a police officer one time and she was going to strangle him but she didn't want to, when she fights she wont stop until someone is really hurt. 
 She often makes up her own words out of the blue and she believes she can control certain people and believes people are out to get her and also thinks people are spying on her laughing at her and reading her mind and getting into her mind, she told me she has thoughts of killing her family and she speaks of an erg to become the worlds biggest murderer and after people have finished talking with her then gives her a hug she said afterwards it felt like they left secret cameras on her watching her every move, her sleep is terrable she'll stay up for two nights sleep then stay up for two nights I just can't get an understanding of what this all is can someone help me?
