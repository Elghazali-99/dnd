Heres the situation...
 I am currently 35 weeks pregnant.me & the father are no longer together.when i found out i was pregnant at 6 weeks,he demanded i have an abortion.im prolife so i said no.when he didnt get his way he beat me to try & make me miscarry.my arms & stomach were bruised up & i had 2 black eyes along with a swollen & hour long bloody nose.i ended up getting a family court restraining order,& he has to go through anger management.
 Now heres the problem...im hearing from several people that hes going to sue me for getting a restraining order on him,that hes going to somehow make me look like an unfit mother,& that him & his mother are going to take the baby away.both his parents are correctional officers & im afraid hes going to get special treatment.what are the chances of me being able to get full custody of my son when hes born? The father is oubviously not a good person,his mother is psyco by sending threatening letters & txts,his new girlfriend has harassed me & is suicidal...i dont want my baby around these people...what could i possibly do to prevent the father from having anything to do with my baby? I currently have pictures of the bruises he gave me & one letter from a witness who heard him slamming me against walls.i also have another person who is going to write a letter about the things hes been saying about me.(she happens to work with him & is my best friend.)
 Any advice would help.im just stressing out so bad & really afraid for the safety of my baby.im sorry this post was so long.
