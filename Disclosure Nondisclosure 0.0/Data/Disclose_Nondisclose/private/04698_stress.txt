I am unsure if I am dealing wth saddness or depression.  I moved far from my hometown 2.5 years ago to with my husband of 17 years and teen daughter. My oldest daughter remained in my home town state for college. 5months ago she had her first chld and my first grandchild.  I was there and spent 5 weeks with her.  Since I moved her I have had uncontrollable sadness and at time so bad I don't want to get out of bed...I am also dealing with menopause, I had a hysterectomy at 32. I am now 44. I feel  that I have no control of my saddness and it is scary.  My husband states he does not know how to help me.  He has become very cold and distant and never talks with me when I am in my "MOOD" as he calls it.  I have told him Ineed him and he saysIdon't know what to say...I also am afraid that in 2 years when my youngest leaes for college, my marraige will be over...  Is this a relationship issue or MY issue {as my husband states}.  We also dont' sleep together any longer due to his serious snoring problem...  So sex is a no no...help lisa
