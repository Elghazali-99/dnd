Hi, 
 My boyfriend and I have been together for two years. We have both acquire high level education. However, when  we fight it seems like we don't k of anything about education or respect. I am a very sensitive person, emotionally attached to my family and to him. I've in this country a fee years ago and he is the only person I have now. 
 We claim to love each other very much and most of our friends envy our love. We have some awesome times when we are OK. But when we fight is horrible. English is not my first language and when we started dating I didn't even know how to say bad words. However, I  the fifth month of being together he started insulting me really bad. He says things so hurtful that I end up completely destroyed. I try to touch his heart and make him calm down but he only gets more and more cruel. What scares me the most is that I think k he enjoys being so cruel when he disagrees with me. Where he sees me destroy, crying and begging him to stop, he will just continue insulting and being mean. 
 In our worse fights I have completely lose control. I have hit him a couple of times. This makes me so sad because this is really not my nature. And I truly believe he likes when this happens because like that he can blame me for everything and state that I am crazy and all is my fault. 
 He has never raised a hand on me. However,  the last time that we fought he said that he would hit me so much that no one will recognize my face.  I need help, I am completely destroyed, lonely and homesick.
