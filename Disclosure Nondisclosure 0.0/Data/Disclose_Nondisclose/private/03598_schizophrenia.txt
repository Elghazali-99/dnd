My sister claims to have multiple chemical sensitivity disorder.  She claims to be so sensitive to smells that she doesn't leave her house. She made a friend strip on her doorstep, take a shower with her soap and wear her clothing to be in her house. She lost her job and has many reasons why she can't do any job -- computers and phones give off bad emissions. She's begging for money and food. Says there’s only one grocery store she can go to because they have a filter on their air conditioning. Several years ago, she told me she was hearing angles talk to her.  She believes she is psychic and talks very odd with singsong ton and uses odd word choices. She’s down to 103 pounds.  So I called the county to do a health and welfare check.  The caseworker closed the case and didn't feel she was mentally ill.  How is that possible?  She's living in just one room of her house and talked to the woman through an open window for a half hour before she agreed to sit on the picnic table and talk. She lied to the caseworker -- telling her that mental illness doesn't run in the family.  Then she called my brother and did a 360 and apologized for exaggerating the situation.  My brother even said that her singsong communication was better.  Is she lying or is she really sick?  What else can be done to get help for her?  Eventually, I think she’ll be homeless.
