i got bullied at my last school until it got so hard that I had to beg and cry for my parents to move me to another school and now at my new school everyone says mean things about me and they're making up rumours saying that I got excluded from my last school because I stabbed someone because it's now true and whenever I deny it nobody believes me so now I can't even stand up for myself cos they all think of me as a laughing stock and someone they can just have a joke about all the time. I know they don't really think I stabbed someone cos if they did they would of been scared to be mean to me but they don't think it, they all just talk about me as if I did do it though just to have some new gossip to talk about but this has been going on since I started at this school which was 3 months ago and I don't have anybody to tell because my family all hate me and don't care about me and I can't tell the teachers because I know it's only gonna make the bullying be worse and I don't have any real friends to help me get through this
