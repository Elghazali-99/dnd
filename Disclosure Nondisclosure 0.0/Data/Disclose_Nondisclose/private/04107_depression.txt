my niece has quit eating for the last few months.  she eats a bowl of cereal in the morning and sometimes a bowl of corn or hominy in the evening,  she does not want to live.  she has lost down to 125 pounds.  she looks bad. she is weak and very seldom goes anywhere.  i dont know what to do.  she has gone from 1xto a small in womens clothes.  she has never been happy and does not want to live. she thinks if she dies this way ot will not be her fault.  her doctor told her if she loses 1more pound she will commit her to the mental hospital under lockdown for 1 month.  she said she is not going tom gain any weight she wants to lose more.  the doctor wants me to go tocourt and have her committed i cant do that.  i love her and  i am at a loss on what to do.  i cant make a grrown woman do what  i want her to do she has her own mind.  her daughter said she is worried but im dont think she is taking  it seriously.  she has her own problems.  she gave most of her clothes to the woman nextt door and a lot of her jewelry.  i am scared and this is messing up my depression.  mandy876
