Hi all, I have been lurking here for awhile but this is my first post. 
I am 45 and believe I am in Perimenopause due to the many symptoms I am experiencing. ( I have an irrational fear of Drs so I haven't made an appointment yet but I WILL go as soon as I get up the nerve).
For the past month or so, I've been having a discharge- I actually don't even know if that is the correct description since it does not mess up my underpants. It started out as just a wet feeling all of the time, now, it is like ovulation mucus only when I wipe after urinating. I'm not sure if it could be BV because although it doesn't smell good, it isn't fishy.. And it's not clumpy like a yeast infection. There is a little irritation but hardly noticeable.
I've read a few threads here where some have said they had this too and it was a normal part of the change but I am scared and worried and need some gentle reassurance.
( I saw on another site where an Gyn suggested this could be a sign of vaginal atrophy and recommended using Rephresh gel which I have tried and it does seem to stop the discharge or the 3 days that it claims to)
Anyone else having this problem? What did you do to control it or is this something I will have to learn to live with until I get to the "dried up" stage?
