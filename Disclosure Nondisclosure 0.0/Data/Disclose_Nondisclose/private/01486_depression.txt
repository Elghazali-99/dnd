Hi I just completed my 20...am feeling very much depressed..
My story goes like this I have been debarred frm my university for 1 year due to sum activities. .
But things going bad for me...I cannot tell my parents as they care for there name and fame..
I just told my elder bro..he said he will manage it up later..in our family basic priority has been given to education. .
Over thinking about it all my things are going crazy.. Due to this am going into depression. ..things were thousand times better before the university issue..
One by one things going bad for me.....my mom seems to be very much caring but on small small issues having fights with her.. these fights are another cause for depression. .am having regular head aches..have noticed a a break down in my weight of almost 7-8 kgs in a month..sometimes I am insomniac either I end up over sleeping...while I  depression I smoke a lot...I get suicidal ideas..-_-.. at the point am helpless...need serious and urgent suggestions plz...
