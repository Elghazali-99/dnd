Hello, I am 28 year olds (never have sex) so that rule out any pregnancy related.
For the past one year, I did not get my menstrual. I believe it was related to me extreme stress (maybe hormone changes) because during that one year, my family member died, I lost my job, our family have to move. Make it short, that one year was so many unhappy things going on my life, I totally break down. I did not even have time to worried about my menstrual, so I just let it stop for one year and didn't pay any attention.
I don't know if this related to menopause (since at age 28) I hope I'm not going on menopause. It is high chances of women get their menopause in their late twenties?
This month, a year later, now I am getting my menstrual back. What I'm worried is since it coming back for the past 2 days, it been very heavy, I am passing huge black color blood clots (large one, very large). I do have blood clots but never I see this large before during my cycles in the past.
Should I just wait couple more days and see? I really don't want to go to hospital, since I don't have health insurance to afford.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm just worried seeing the large blood clots. And I am even more worried that I enter menopause and now getting menstrual again? Scary!
