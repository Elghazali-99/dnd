I'm a thirteen year old girl and I feel like I'm going insane .every single day I feel depressed and like everything is a dream .I honestly don't know why I'm depressed wanting to kill my self .I never let my self cry and I feel like a brick is placed upon my chest .when I'm around fellow people all I can think about is killing my self .no one knows I'm depressed because I act perfectly normal . some days I just think about wanting to cut my self and to watch the blood slowly Come out , to just punch something ,or to do something that's dangerous . literally ,the dream situation started one day out of no where (before that I was depressed as well)I started getting thoughts if this world is actually a thing or is it just something I'm making up .its like a high feeling just all day ,everyday .it feels hazy and I can't think straight.I want to do crazy things since I think everything is a dream ,like run into traffic . I have a short memory spam but it wasn't always like this .I am smart ,I write at a high level ;however sometimes I think I'm out of it .moments come where I frezze and can't move so stay I stay in a thinking mode type thing .I have a lot of anger ,causing me to snap a lot .I am not sure where this is coming from .all I am aware of is me needing help.
