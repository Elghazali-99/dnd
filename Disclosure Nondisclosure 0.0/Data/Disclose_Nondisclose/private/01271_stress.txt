I'm well into my 4th (non-consecutive) year of serving tables. I've been a waitress at 3 different restaurants all which were very different. First I need to rant a little about this. People, remember that it is not easy to be nice and sweet to demanding strangers all the time. Most of us take getting the order right very seriously and get upset when we make a mistake. When you ask us stupid questions (which happens a lot) it's so hard not to just say really? you can't figure this out on your own? Yet, we serve you because we need the money that badly. 
 When I've been putting in long hours at work I feel awful, like my real thoughts are all bottled up. Not to mention my managers are not very good leaders. We are seriously short staffed and no one will do anything about it. My coworkers and I are getting overworked and making lots of mistakes. I know for a fact that they are interviewing people who can help fill in the hours that we need worked, but they aren't hiring them. The entire time I'm working I get told what I'm doing wrong and yelled at. When the shift is over I'm told I did a great job and am a wonderful asset to the team. I'm so confused!
 Not to mention my knees hurt, my back hurts and my hips hurt. I asked if I could bartend or answer phones, but instead I got to host. I make so much less money doing this. I do make really good money serving but I'm starting to think it's not worth it and perhaps time to find a different job. I used to serve full time in a diner just fine, but everything is so heavy at the current restaurant I'm at that I'm having a hard time. I'm looking for something else to do right now, but it's so hard to hang on until I find something else!
