Ok I'm almost 16 years old and female. Now i think im depressed. There are times where i get sad for no reason and start crying and can't stop. I feel alone a lot of the time. I did used to cut but have not in a while. I did think suicidal thoughts but never acted on them. They were more what would happen if i did or even thoughts of how. I did have one person i was close too try to commit suicide twice. There are times where i cant fall asleep for hours and others where i fall alseep but then have nightmares. I have noticed a small loss in appetite but weight is still the same. There are also times where i get irritable for no reason and times where i just cant force my self to talk. I also get headaches a lot if that means anything. I don't really have anyone to talk to either. I can't tell my family because then they will think im just faking. I don't go out and hang with friends because im not allowed. I do text but the conversations are always short and not because of me ending it. As for reasons why i might be depressed well there are a lot. I moved recently away from all my friends. Im extremely shy and cant make news one easily. I get verbally abused a lot. Ive never had many friends when i was younger and ive been bullied. I know this seems all over the place but im just trying to get everything out. I really dont know what i can do though to help myself or if i need to go to someone else.
