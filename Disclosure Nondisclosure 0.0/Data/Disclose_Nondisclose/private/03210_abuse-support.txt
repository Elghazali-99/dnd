when I was 9, my dad sexually abused me for the first time. For about a year he continued to hurt me. at least once a week he would come in and touch me, and get me to touch him. When he was angry or drunk he would get rough and also beat me up. The worst time was a few weeks before my 10th birthday when he took my virginity. At the same time he would both physically and mentally abuse me, my sister and my mum. He would bash us up. Including my 7 year old sister, even though my mum and I would try our best to not let that happen. He would play mind games, call me a worthless ***** and stuff. I became depressed. I am now 13 and they have finally split. I am sad all the time. I cry myself to sleep often and have flashbacks. Lots of people just think I'm a freak because I'm paranoid. I think I have a sleeping disorder as I usually don't sleep for days at a time, and when I do sleep I get horrific nightmares. I do self harm and have suicidal thoughts but I know I couldn't as I have a duty to protect my family. I'm just so scared he's going to come back, that he's going to take my sister, or me. I couldn't bare to let her get hurt. I get stomach pains often, and I don't know what they are. Sort of like cramps cross food poisoning. I'm not sure. But they become so terrible I end up on the floor screaming. Please help me. I'm so scared.
