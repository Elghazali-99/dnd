Hey everyone, not sure where to start really but here it goes
 was diagnosed with stress realted anxiety a few weeks back and i was put on some BETA blockers which are used to combat the signs of stress and anxiety.
 The problem that is worrying me is that, after I have gathered my thoughts after waking, I find myself very down and scared because of a growing pressure in my head, now it comes and goes but is situated around the top of my scull.
 I have been worrying like mad that it may be a brain tumor, however when I work out I feel nothing because I am not thinking about it and am able to move on. But as soon as I start to stress out again it happens again.
 I believe it purely related to stress but cant seem to get my mind to think that, it feels like my brain is closing in like 2 sides of a wall closing in.
 I find myself second guessing myself alot of the time which i haven't usually done and there is also an occasional pain in the heart relating to the anxiety I would imagine.
 I just cant understand why this is happening? my doctor mentioned that if it was something serious she would be able to see the tumor vessels when she looked up my nose.
 I recently lost my job and have had difficulty amusing myself until my girlfriend/friends see me, 
 just looking for some basic advice really, I mean suffice to say the best option is to try and get rid of anything stressing me out, but I'm not sure what is.
 any help would be grateful
 Graham
