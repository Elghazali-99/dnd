Over the past 14 weeks I have become progressively more unwell. I had a cough viral broncho at the beginning of April which hung around (still have a bit of a cough and sinus congestion now) Mid April I noticed my big toes was numb (I though a bad fitting shoe had caused this) but the numbness and pins and needles began to spread up my leg to my knee and then my hip/bottom, back and now arms, hands and head - this has taken about 8-10 weeks. I am booked in for an MRI brain and neck scan on Monday - I have had a lumber MRI which didn't really show any abnormalities. I am a busy primary school teacher who has just finished a M.Ed while working full time. The doc suggested stress and over work? depression? Chronic Fatigue? But Neuro is thinking MS!!!!! But the more I reserach and look I see that my symptoms could be lots of this.....Candida, Post Viral Stress, Menopause? I am of course beside myself with worry and feeling like I am loosing it!!!! any suggestions welcome. I am taking vitamins and minerals day and night (I have honestly spent $1000 on supplements) Thank you in advance. I am 46 years old and untill 14 weeks ago very fit and healthy, loved exercise and loved my job - but now even getting out of bed is an effort. I have joint pain, a completly dea right foot, hypo sensitive right led, buttock, back and now pins and needles in both arms and hands, face, head - it feels like a swarm of bees are living inside of me???
