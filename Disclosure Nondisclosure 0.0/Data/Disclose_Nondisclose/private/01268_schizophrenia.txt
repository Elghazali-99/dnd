Hi im a 21 year old female with long family history of mental illness. Firstly my great grandmother battled schizophrenia ..so to does my grandmother. My mother on the other hand has had problems over the years with depression, from time to time she is filled with energy cleaning , washing and talking excessively, cursing and being aggressive. These instances are much less often now... she has a good job and it has been years since she was hospitalised. Nonetheless, i am an only child and its been hard as from a very young age i've felt more like her mother than her daughter.  But to the point of this post as an only child surrounded by adults i got into the habit of talking to myself, sometimes i imagine i'm talking to a friend or that im with friends having fun when i'm bored. Is this odd? I have always been anxious, my mom is that way as well, over the last 2 yr my anxiety has gotten awful. My desire to obtain top honours at university has resulted in heart palpitations. When i have these bouts i'm nauseous and can't eat. I feel edgy alot and jump at the slightest thing, sometimes i think i see stuff out the corner of my eye like insects but i know consciously that thats just my anxiety. Finally i admit i do have an obsessive personally i was teased in school for my weight since then i have had poor eating habits which caused me to lose 20 pounds (i'm 5'5 weigh 120). I'm over the rabbit eating now  lol thank god, i love pizza too much,  but i do exercise alot and look in the mirror constantly. I know this is a long post but i cant talk to my mom or my friends so i just want to know if im heading towards schizophrenia.
