I am Christina. I am a normal person. That is what people think,
But I am not a normal person. I fight with depression alone. without anyone or any med.
Sometimes I make it. Sometimes I fail.
Lately things get worse every day.I cant handle listening to music cause I cry.
I noticed that I develop a possessiveness over the people I know. For example I hate it when my best friend has sex with his gf, or I get jealous when an another friend meets a new girl in his life. I am easily attached to people but this is ridiculous. I realize that I cant be the only one girl of everyone's life but still this self centered behaviour that grows in me -that I avoid to show- annoys my calm nature. 
To be honest everyone tells me his/her problems waiting support and a hand of help. I was always ready to help. But I am so tired....
I feel alone lately and maybe that is why such egoistic behaviour appeared but still....it is bad and annoying for me cause I feel more hurt and more alone in the end. 
Some days I feel I dont have soul. That something called egoism devoured it. But other days I just realize it is the pain of loneliness that plays his tricks on me...
Please reply....
Christina
