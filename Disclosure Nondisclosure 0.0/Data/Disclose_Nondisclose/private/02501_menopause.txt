Hello everyone.   I turned 37 in march, i have been suffering with horrible hot flashes, night sweats, reduced libido, sleeplesness for about 8 months now.   I had my right ovary removed back in August 2012 because of a dermoid cyst.  I was fine for about three months after the surgery then in december the hot flashes started again and all the other symtoms... i went to the doctor on march 26th and had blood work to check my hormone levels.  Doc said that i was in perimenopause.   i was supposed to get my period on april 1st and i havent gotten it yet the weird thing is the hot flashes stopped.  as of the last week in march they just stopped.   right now i have no period, my breasts are incredibly sore, i have a LOT of discharge vaginal dryness horrible... after trying every over the counter pill to help me sleep the doc gave me ambien and it did nothing,  i asked him for xanax and until now it has worked perfectly because it relaxes me. before it was horrible i coulndt fall asleep or if i was asleep i woke up becasue my heart was beating too fast.  I was sooooooooo tired all the time.  i have had 4 pregnancy tests and all negative.     my question is...  could this be perimenopause? Doc said my estrogen levels were a little low and i didnt need HRT nor i want to take it. (family history of cancer and rather not take a chance) i had a papsmear and doc checked for stds etc they said everything came back normal..   i am always paranoid cause i have had problems since i was 18.   i have two pregnancies and two children one is 19yrs old the other one is 4yrs old.   i never thought i would go thru this at 37... oh and i have also gained weight :(    Is anyone experiencing the discharge and breast tenderness too?
