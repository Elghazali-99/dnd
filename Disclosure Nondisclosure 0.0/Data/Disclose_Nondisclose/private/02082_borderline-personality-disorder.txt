Hi all.  I was recently diagnosed with OCD, components of BiPolar NOS and components of Border Line Personality Disorder.  My BP components are that I can not take an antidepressant without a mood stabilizer.  My OCD and BP and BPD (as told to me by the PDoc) are the causes for the deep depressive phases and obsessive and intursive thoughts.  He went on to say that my need to have my emotional needs met PDQ was a product of the BPD.  I am really confused.  I don't cut - never have - and I don't have extreme anger issues at people nor a heightened fear of abandonment.  I mean, I don't think ANYONE wants to be abandoned but I guess the extent of mine would be that I do fear something happening to me husband and being without him.  Anyhoo - I don't get it.  How does one have COMPONENTS of something.  Anyone else out there like me?  BTW: the meds are working really great, though.  No more depression and way low on the obessive/intrusive thoughts.  (There wasn't an OCD forum or I would have posted there, too!)
