please help . my grandson will be 4 july 5th. going on 2 yrs. now he is showing more signs of anger. when he doesn't get what he wants, he throws things,hits and spits at my daughter and i. she was living with a man 28 yrs old for 2 yrs and this guy acted as his father. the real father never was in the picture. my daughter is 29 and my grandson has no respect for her. their was alot of fighting and cursing in the house,but now this guy moved out.my concern is we are out in public and my grandson screams,spits and hits,when he can't get his way. i don't know what to do. he does go to school, a headstart program, and doesn't act this way at all there. i love him so much and i have spanked him on the butt,felt really bad and that does not effect him at all anyway.i do feel that since this guy was living with us ,all of the acting out started. can you steer me in the right direction to get help. the school was suppose to ,but now it's summer break and they did not get the help we need now with him. i would do anything for my family, i want to take him places, but i am so embarrassed. please help us
