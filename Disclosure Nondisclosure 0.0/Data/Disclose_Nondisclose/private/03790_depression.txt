I drank 2 vodka and 2 beers, i didn't really drink it but took a sip on all of them and threw it in the drain, and after that day i woke up in the morning and i notice that when i take a look at my left or right i feel a falling sensation, to define this an example is try to stand and try to let your whole body fall that shock feeling is what i feel when i do air boxing or just by looking at my left or right and i don't know if its brain fog or like brain fog but i feel a little bit dizzy, confuse and can't think properly, and feel unbalanced when i walk or stand, i saw a post before about sake causing brain fog too, i think both sake and vodka has some kind of ingredient that causes this, i don't get this symptoms when drinking regular beer but after taking a sip of vodka i had experience this symptoms, and i don't think its a chemical sensitivity for drinking both beer and vodka, or if the vodka had methanol in it or if i had brain damage, and i also experienced memory lapses an example of this is mind block because i can't think properly, its been a week now and i'm still experiencing this symptoms. I hope a neurologist could answer my question and i'm posting this in both neurology and psychiatry section.
