Hello I am 17 years old and I have just been diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety disorder. I've always had anxiety attacks since I was in middle school but now I'm having severe panic and anxiety attacks. And I just don't feel myself anymore. So a doctor put me on med's; Celexa for my depression, Clonidine for my A.D.D, and Klonopine for my panic and anxiety. So far I've been getting better but for some reason this thought keeps coming in my head and starts my anxiety right away. It's like I'm self conscious I'm looking through my eyes. I know it's sounds very strange but that's the only way that I can really explain it. It's like its my first time seeing like this and I'm scaring myself and constantly asking others do you see like this or like that. It's really making my life almost unbearable! Has anyone ever experienced this or can you at least comfort me for advice and/or help me figure out whether this has to do with my depression or my anxiety. Truly appreciate it.
