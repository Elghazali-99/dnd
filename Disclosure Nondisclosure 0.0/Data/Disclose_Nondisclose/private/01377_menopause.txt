a year and a half ago I had two tubal pregnancies caused because I had a tubal litigation 5 years prior.... after the 2nd I had my tubes removed...since then I had been told I had HPV by my gyno. and had signs of cervical cancer, I had a cyro. procedure done, which freezes the possible cancerous cells.  After that procedure my health went down hill.  I had a terrible spell about a month later in the middle of dinner I started to black out and the room was spinning around me, I couldn't lift my arms and had a hard time focusing, this lasted for about 10min.  , I went to my physician who took blood work , said my thyroid levels were low and didn't do anything for 3 months just kept taking more blood work.  He was baffled.  My dizziness continued for those 3 months.  Now, a week before my period I get extremly dizzy and as I have my period I am extremly tired , my mind is very very foggy , its hard to focus and make quick decisions.  This lasts for about a week and then I go back to myself and repeats all over the next month.  What on earth is happening to me?  Any ideas?  I was put on a low dose of zoloft after all this because it was making me so anxious, I felt I was dying.
