I am a young girl in my early twenties and I've grown up with my father from since birth. My parents got divorced shortly after I was born. Our relationship is about almost non-existant because he lived in another country and also got remarried and has two other children. I have seen him about five times in my entire life and probably speak to him on the phone about five times a year if that much. I don't love him but i don't hate him. I jus feel nothing towards him because we don't really have a relationship. He is not a man of much words, he never said ' I love you' or 'I miss you' or ' I wish things were different'. I feel like something is missing in my life. My actual problem is that I feel as though I can't form an intimate relationship with a man, like there is a gap when it comes to loving someone. I have had only one relationship which lasted only 2 months in high school. I have had the opportunity for other relationships but it's like i can't do it. I dont fear rejection but i fear hurting the other person because I have never been showed and have never expressed love by my father. I'm tired of being called heartless and emotionless by guys. I wonder if growing up without my father and not having much of a relationship with him has caused me to feel like and act like this ?
