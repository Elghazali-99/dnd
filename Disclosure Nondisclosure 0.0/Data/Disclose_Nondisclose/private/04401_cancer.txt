Okay I asked about this like 2 years ago and kinda forgot about it and it hasnt bothered me since! And all of a sudden I've worried about it again! I have a node/gland on each side of my jaw! If you look at a diagram of where the nodes/glands are its kinda where the submandibular glands are on each side! It's literally identical on both sides too! If I push up under my jaw behind where my teeth are sort of thing! I can feel a lump on each side it's quite hard and rubbery sort of feel! If I look down I can move the lump easily! I have checked elsewhere also and can't feel any nodes in my groin or armpit! It's literally just those two! In terms of how long I have been able to feel them... It's been like 7-8 years!! They never cause any trouble! Now and then they can be a little bit tender but other than that absoloutely nothing! They are literally the exact same size as what I have always remembered them! If it changes anything I am 20 years old so when I found them I must have been about 12 or 13! They just worry me now and then and I haven't really ever got much advice on them!!! I just know it isn't 100% normal!!! 
I'd really appreciate any advice or opinions! 
Thankyou so so much.
