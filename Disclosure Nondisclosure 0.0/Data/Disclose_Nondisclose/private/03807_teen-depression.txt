I know that you may be thinking " Well, she's only thirteen and she's so quick to label herself!", or "Your'e too young." But I am almost certain that i'm bipolar. Here are some reasoning:
 -I have constant mood swings; I am quick to yell at person or threaten them when I am severly in the depressive episode. This episode lasts about a week.
-  When i'm happy, i'm usually funny, put-together, nice, and kind.
-I always think about suicide and cutting
- It runs in my family. (And bipolar is genetic...)
 And here is the other problem, I have told my mom and dad that I'm really sure I have bipolar and she is very aggressive and says, " --------- ,(I don't want to say my name...) You are not bipolar, if you were, you would be some freak show and you would be cutting yourself and......" But I kind of do, but don't want to tell her.... 
Yeah so... I have no idea to do now. My mom doesn't believe me, and my dad usually agrees to whatever she says so what  do I do? 
 Please help. Sorry, I sound like an aggressive teenager but i'm snarky right now.
