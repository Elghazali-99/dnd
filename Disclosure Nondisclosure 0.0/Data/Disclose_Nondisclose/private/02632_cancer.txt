I've noticed lately that both my Epitrochlear lymph nodes are swollen in my arm. At first I thought it was a cyst because I get cysts often, but I'm now realizing they're both in the same place on both arms and are in the same location of the Epitrochlear lymph nodes. I was checking myself for other inflamed nodes and I found another one under my right armpit. I'm not sick or anything. I have been really tired lately and just plain old exhausted... but that's kind of normal for me. My joints have been sore, but that's normal for me too. Could this be lymphoma? I'm only 26 but cancer does run in my family, so I'm a little worried. Is there other causes for something like this that are less serious that doesn't cause a sore throat or cough? I've noticed that periodically throughout this year I've noticed my throat nodes would swell, but they quickly go back down. Any ideas why this could be happening? Should I wait it out until I get my insurance in April? Or is this something I need to act on now?  
 Also, I remember that I had one swollen node on my arm for months, I always thought it was a cyst until the other one popped up. So I think I've had that for a while. Thanks for reading.
