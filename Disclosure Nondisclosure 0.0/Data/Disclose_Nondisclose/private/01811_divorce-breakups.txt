My husband was in prison for 14 yrs. He has been out 15 yrs and we have been together 4 years. The problem started with him not wanting to have sex with me and finally going to the sofa to sleep. He said he just wasn't interested in sex anymore at all with no one! Recently I was informed by a gay coworker that my husband was on two gay dating sites! So I looked them up and confronted him about this he was so upset and left for a few days and went to his mothers, I called him and he said please give me a few days Im so confused and need to think. So I gave him a week and called him he was a totally different guy! He was rude and said to me tell whoever you want! He said I told my family and its all I care about! I owe you no excuse for being on there! I love him still and would like this not to end my marriage! I know it started in prison! He was 21 when he went! He has only just recently There is no way getting past what has happened not in a way that is going to make me want to be with you in the way you want me to be.Its just not going to happen at this point! What can I do?
