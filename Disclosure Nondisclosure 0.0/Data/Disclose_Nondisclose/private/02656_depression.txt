My girlfriend is suffering badly, for the last 20 years she has seen a lot of horrible things happen with her family, her dad left her at the age of 9 and went of and had a new family, leaving her,her sister and mum, her mum suffered badly with depression, she then had to bring and raise up her sister and mother, they moved away and started a new life but her dad has never been a good dad always putting therm second best to his new family, lots of family arguments, he is also a alchaolic to this day, her mum was used and abused all her life via various men and was witness by her two daughters, and wasn't the best of mums, during this time her dad has had three other sibling and they have all become very spoilt and well looked after, i could go on to say a lot more but i don't want to say to much, its not been the best life, we met a school and were together and then split she went of and had a marriage and kids and that ended, after 12 years we hooked back up, been together for 3 years but broken up three times the same time every year, now she gets really down and depressed, she bottled her problems and has never dealt with her dad and is finally saying goodbye and letting go, she is taking all her anger out on me, and we have split again, but this time she has finny agreed to go to the doctors and get councelling, now I'm not contacting her and giving her the space, but we lived together and i was a step parent so I'm not giving up, but I'm not speaking to her and letting her fix herself, the problem i have is in a couple of days will be her nans birthday and she died three years ago, and she was like a mother to her, do i send her a message saying thinking of you today or do i remain the no contact, then its her birthday in june her 30th and again do remain no contact? i love her dearly and she loves me but she ended it because she needs to be on her own which i told her last year and she didn't do anything other than date a guy for 4 months. now she is getting help i am willing to ride through. please advice needed by doctors or councerilers of what to do when dealing with someone so irrational atm?
