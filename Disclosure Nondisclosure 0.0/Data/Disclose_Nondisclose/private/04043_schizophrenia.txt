My husband has had schizophrenia for ten years. I've known him for six months and we have been married for five. All the history I know on him has come from his sister and our mutual friends. He hears voices and uncontrollably says what he hears and shakes his right hand. During these frequent episodes he can't be roused and can't hear me talking to him. He also can't listen to music or watch tv with the sound on, he has to read subtitles. He has been noncompliant with medication through the years and has a history of drug abuse  starting from an age of 15. Now he is on zyprexa and is compliant with it, but it only helps with paranoia and keeps him from getting worse. I've never seen anything like this before and I'm hoping this new dr will help him, with me going to the appointment the dr will get the full story instead of a sugar coated story from my husband. He can control his episodes just enough to not let the doctors see what's really going on. I want to help him more than anything and I love him dearly. But what is going to stop these voices and his talking so he can live normal again!?
