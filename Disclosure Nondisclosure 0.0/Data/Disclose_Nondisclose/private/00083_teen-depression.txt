Hi. I'm a 16 year old female who has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADD. I go to regular therapy, attend a very rigirous school, and live with a very strict family.
 Recently, my family life has been kind of rough. My younger sister ignores me and is very rude, although she could just be entering that moody stage that all kids go through. However, it still makes me feel rejected. My parents keep stressing about finances, and not too long ago I was told that I would have to pay for my dental bill and classes. This amounts to $1,000 or more. I'm jobless and have never had any way to make money. I understand that I need to take responsibility, but this debt on top of stressful school finals and projects isn't helping at all. I need to find jobs, pass my driver's exam, study for finals, do homework, practice driving, attend 10 hour long school days, spend my sundays doing chores, and now find a way to make over $1,000. I cancelled my bithday plans so I wouldn't stress my parents even more, even though I'm the one who's stressed out now.
 In the past couple of days, I haven't felt like eating, sleeping, or doing anything for that matter. I haven't gotten sleep in over 24 hours, and can barely even eat a granola bar. I can't focus on my work and keep thinking depressive thoughts, even when I'm taking my medication every day. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I've contemplated suicide before, but only until now have I seriously considered it as a backup plan to failing. I broke down crying in the middle of class today for the first time in my life. I don't know how to stop feeling so overwhelmed. Please help.
 Thank you for taking the time to read this. Advice would be appreciated.
