My son is doing better but still struggling.  I want to be there for him but don't know how.  I tell him I love him from time to time even though he doesn't reciprocate.  We have tried to remove all stressor / pressures from him so that he can recover from this.  When he wants to sleep, we let him.  When he tells us to leave him alone, we do.  We don't force anything upon him but I am not sure that is working too well b/c some weekends he never leaves the house.  We love him beyond words.  What is the best way for us to show him that we love him and that we are 100% there for him without smothering or crowding him?  He is a very private person.  Unfortunately, he is living in his own private hell.   I don't like how he sometimes isolate himself...but we can't force him to do things he doesn't want to.  Please tell me teens how you want to be treated by your parents when you feel like this.  I am afraid he hates us but we have done nothing bad to him and have only put him on a pedestal for 16 years.
