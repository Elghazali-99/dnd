Hi, I'm a 35 yr old male with occasional abdominal discomfort. my stools are what concern me the most at this time. they occasionally float and most of the time leave a clear haze on top of the water (not very obvious but its there). they are soft and formed but very messy when wiping .  over the last 6 months I sometimes get these bouts of diarrhea with mucus towards the end (lasts 24hrs or so they had picked up in frequency as of late 5 attacks in 5 weeks but I started taking a probiotic again and its been a 2 months since last episode.   I had a normal colonoscopy 2 yrs ago. since then i've also had normal ct scan of abdomen and pelvis, u.s. of gallbladder, hida scan, blood, and stool tests including fat (not 72hr one, nobody seems to want to give me that all thou I requested it) all these tests were normal. upper endoscopy with biopsies only showed mild gastritis and gerd. I take nexium for acid and generic librax for stomach gurgling. I can't stop fixating on my pancreas but my drs. don't seem concerned about my fears and tell me probably ibs even though I normally go once a day and rarely have diarrhea or constipation. What I really want to know does this sound like pancreatic cancer? if not fat what else could this hazy substance be?.... mucus?  What tests are left? I know its a lot of info and that i'm a hypochondriac but any advice would be appreciated!
