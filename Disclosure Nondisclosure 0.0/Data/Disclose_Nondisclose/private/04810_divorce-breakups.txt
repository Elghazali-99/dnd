I had been dating a girl whom i met through a friend about 2 years ago. We were never the bf or gf couple, i would date other people and she could to. In October we decided to officially be bf and gf, by that time she lived 5 hours away with some friends and we would take turns traveling to see each other, by Dec. her friends wanted her to move out, her and her 2 children, boy and a girl he is 5 and she is 7, so i told her not to worry come over here and live with me. The 5 yr old is on his last treatments for leukimia, so since dec, till now i have lost my mind with both children, the little girl is so far behind in school, that i come home from work and would find myself having to help a child who seems to have never learned nothing and the son is uncontrollable screams, tried hitting me several times and pretty much was never taught dicipline cause of his condition that started when he was 2, i have a 12 year old whom i was very strict with and i try teach them this to them and i cant. my gf says i have to try and i am like, it has been 3 months, the father does not pay childsupport, i do pay for my son and am the only one working till today, she got a job, and i feel like i cant take it no more, am i doing wrong by leaving, i told her i will keep helpin with expenses until she is fine with her new employer. I love her, but i cant cope with the kids, i think of how well behaved my son was and how he was at school, and with my gf, I dont even want to shop with them cause her son usually well scream or cry jump, anything to have his way. I told my gf that i cant stand the kids no more, and that its not healthy for us to be living together, i am going crazy, i dont even concentrate at work and my boss tells me that i am not the same happy outgoing person that i was.
