My girlfriend and i officially brokeup about two weeks ago. March 19th is the official date but we had an altercaion in the mall ten days prior on the 9th. I will give you all the tail end of the situation to save some time and reading. Brief background first, our relationship was very volatile. We argued just about everyday, and almost always over the smallest and stupidest things. The only big issue that we had was that she didnt trust me. I've never cheated or lied to her but she ALWAYS assumed I was talking to other girls. I've never cheated a day in my life. So we would argue about that sometimes too. 
 On to what happened in March...
We had an altercation in the mall on the 9th. When we parted I never called her when I got home for the first time since we got together. I figured that she would most likely go see her friend to tell her what happened and she wouldnt answer my call anyway, so I was going to give her a couple days this time. Two days later on the 11th I get hate mail from her (Totally unexpected) I got an email saying how much of a waste of time I was and I am worthless and I'm a ***** with high emotions and she is done with me and she is never looking back and I was a good joke for her friends and family, etc. I tried calling right after I read the message but no answer. I left voice mails and then sent a stupid email pretty much confirming the breakup saying things like sorry I couldnt be the man you wanted me to be and Im sure you'll find someone right for you etc. Stupid! I called my friend Cammy to tell her what happened and get her advice, thats when Cammy tells me that my girlfriend called her earlier on that day looking for me. She said my girlfriend told her that we had an argument in he mall but I never called so she doesnt know if I'm safe or what. I suffered hard from the 11th to the 19th because she would not talk to me. This was the worst. I got my friends to call her, my aunt from Georgia called her, even my mother called her and left a message saying to call her back but she didnt. I called her on the 19th and se answered. It was the worst conversation of my entire life. She cut me up bad. I was crying and begging and pleading and she just didnt care. The conversation lasted approx 5 or 6 hours. She hung up on me a few times but kept picking up when I called back. 
 The coversation got worse when she made me three way a girl on the line whom she thought I was trying to mess with. This was an old work friend who I recieved and email from a few weeks prior asking how I was and we should catch up. My girlfriend didnt believe that I recieved an email from her so she made me three way her to make her admit sending me an email. To my amazement she denied sending me the email. She swore up and down that she didnt send me an email because she doesnt have a contact for me. I couldnt understand why she was saying that. Then my girlfriend jumps in and started saying whatever she had to. So now it looked like I was lying her. I discovered the next day that the email I recieved wasnt from who I thought i was but from someone else whom I used to go to school with that has the same name just spelled differently. Anyway, she called me all sorts of horrible names and hung up on me for the last time. 
 After experiencing that, after losing all my dignity and self respect, I was upset. I sent her one of the worst emails I ever sent anyone. I never called her a ***** or **** or ***** or anything like that but I said some extremely horrible things. I told her that if God ever made a mistake it would be her and that they say the devil couldnt breth life but she is living testimony to the contrary and so on. I thought that after experiencing how cold and heartless she could be it wouldnt be hard to get over her.But that feeling only lasted a day. After that I went right back to crying and all the pain. Its so much worse now. I havent had any contact with her since the 20th when I sent that email. How could I contact her after that? But I regret it and I want to fix it. I just want to talk to her and explain things and try and bring things back to how they used to be in the beginning. 
 We had A LOT of good times, even in spite of all the arguing and disagreeing, we had what I believe is worth saving and believe it or not we've made it through worse. I want to let her know and believe that I am sorry and that I have realized and learned so much since we broke up and I still want to be with her and work on our isses together. I dont want to build this and go through this with anyone else. I cry every single day and I dont get enough sleep. I dream about her every night (which is freaky) and no matter how hard I try I can only seem to think about and remember the good in our relationship. How do I fix what I've done. How do I get her to at least talk to me civilly and cordially? Someone please give me some ideas. 
 This is my plan so far...
 1. On approx April 20th or so I am going to hand write and mail a short letter to her just basically saying that I agree with the breakup and that she made a wise choice and it needed to happen and just briefly metioning that I have been making a lot of changes and admit my mistakes and briefly apologize. Also going to let her know that if she still wishes to have nothing to do with me I will respect and understand that. 
 I know she wont respond to this but this will just be to open the floor, Put me back in her mind, assuming she is not thinking about me. 
 2. A few days after that, I will again hand write a formal letter of apology. stating that I want to make peace with her and that I take full responsibility for the things I've done and said and explain how I was feeling and that I have changed as a result of the couseling I've been recieving (which we talked about getting in the relationship). 
 I dont think she will respond to this either
 3. Then I am going to send her a very unique package with a very unique gift. A gift that will last forever (Literally) or at least thousands of years to come. I am going to attach a poem to this gift as well as a relevant added gift to compliment the package. 
 4. Last I am going to include an invitation to somewhere very special that will accent the gift. Maybe then we can talk. 
 What do you all think? an I get her back? :'(
