Hi everyone... Was recently diagnosed with major depressive disorder and was prescribed welbutrin 300 mg a day and Prozac 15mg a day. Does anyone know if this is considered a high dose and secondly has anyone been prescribed Wellbutrin and did u find that it was helpful in treating the depression? I'm concerned because depression does not run in the family and I am in my forties and NEVER had depression in the past. I believe what may have triggered it is the fact that for the past ten years I have been going through a lot of medical problems that required surgeries. Each time I was advised I needed surgery and needed anywhere from 1-2 weeks off work my employers would let me go because they could not afford to have an employee out for this long. This has been the case with my past four jobs and I have to say it made me feel less then a person. I've always had self confidence but now I am considering going back to work but I'm unsure if this will make me feel better or worse. My self esteem has already been shot because of being let go from my past jobs for medical issues. If anyone has had similar experiences please share. Even if not medically related does working a job while being depressed make u feel better or worse. Wellbutrin has helped me with actually getting out of bed, however because of past experience I still don't seem to be motivated, but would really like to get back working again.
