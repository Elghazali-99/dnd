my girlfriend left me in January, since then I declared myself sick and took 7 weeks off work (worked shifts 6am-2pm 1 week and 2pm-10pm the next), before then I had a lot of problems,Depression, anxiety, Insomnia, to much gaming, I got angry a lot, my life was a mess and even tho I tried to change it I knew something had to give and my girlfriend leaving me was what bought me to my knees in a sobbing mess...
 Now iv been back at work since the 4th of march iv been granted a permanent 2pm till 10pm shift to help with my insomnia which was hard to cope with when working alternating shifts, iv also been prescribed 15 mg mirtazapine to help with anxiety depression, but I don't really like taking antidepressants and im very very gradually lowering my dose.
 in a nutshell guys, I feel lonely,sometimes hopeless, afflicted, I get this feeling in my tongue which can make speech difficult sometimes ( its one of the worst symptoms I really don't like and its anxiety,insomnia related) I don't know who I can turn to for help anymore, I don't have any real friends who care or understand what im going through,i feel so alone with my problems, I need help and support, I want to feel normal again, just back to my old self but this time a whole lot wiser.... I just hope that soon il start to feel better and all the horrible things im afflicted with now will gradually lift away and il feel somewhat normal again... 
 im struggling still, iv tried to get in touch my ex but its useless shes blocked me out and its just useless,
can anyone give me any advice on how im suppose to deal with this kind of situation?
