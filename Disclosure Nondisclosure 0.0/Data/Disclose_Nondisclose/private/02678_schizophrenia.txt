Okay so my daughter is going through a rough time, she keeps going out with knives and calling the police or paramedics saying shes going to commit suicide so they took her to hospital but she escaped and the police brought her back and they said to me that she went to the kitchen and picked up a knife and threatned one of the police officers and the restrained her hand cuffed her and she still was fighting against her so bassically the psychiatric doctor said her symptoms to me witch are: she thinks her thoughts are broadcasted on tv and billboards, she hears a male and female voice she sees the female who is called bethan, she hurts her self or others, she constantly thinks about suicide and committing it, she thinks people are constantly watching her like there are cameras everywhere, she thinks people are out to get her, she thinks some people are discized as humans but they are really demons, when she sees a bunch of people laughing she thinks they're laughing at her. She also sees things like hanging ropes, spiders, strings, and things moving. I dont understand what does she have and why does she do these things?
