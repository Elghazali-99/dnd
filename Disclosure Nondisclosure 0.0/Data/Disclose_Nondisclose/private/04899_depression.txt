HELLO, Im up for my social security disability hearing on november 3rd.. Ive been waiting for this for 4 years , and my attorneys are like you have a slam dunk case. I have depression, borderline personality disorder, severe panick atttacks, schitzo manifestation , ptsd and socialized anziety .. God thats so bad.. anyway I just had a baby, Im living with my parents and the hearing where they say 98 oercent of people get approved is finally here.. Im loooking at abt 20 thousnad in back pay and d1100 a month. Well a bit of bad news came in today... about 4 years ago I was on probation for a misdemenaor charge, I paid the monthly fines but my probation officer did not tell me it wpould continue, so it went to the county collections and 6 months later I get this bill for 2000 dollars at 14 percent interest rate, saying I could possibly have a lein on any future assets. Well a friend told me that her newphew was on disability got arrested and never paid his fine and they stopped his disability but it was a felony.and she doesnt know if he got it back or not (shes looking into that by next week, when I see her). Can they really not approve me for this fine I owe, thts now at a a 3frd party collections, how can I pay it when Im disabled. How is this possible. How can they denie you your right as a tax payer who became disabled and cant work over a bill with a lein. How will i ever get it paid if they denie me. Please if anyone knows about this or better yet who can I ask I would appreciate it, my attorney is waiting for the letter to see what it exactly says, but she said it doesnt sound right but she didnt want to say much until she read letter. Please only write back if you know not if you guess cause Im so confused and Im so depressed about this , it was going to save my life and I just dont understand how they can do this to someone who cant work. Thank you for your time and reading this.. Sandy
