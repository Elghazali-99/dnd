Hi, to start of, i'm 18 male from Australia. I've been going through signs and symptoms which have been affecting
my life greatly.
 These include: Frequent urination, back pains (in the center of my back), numbness (when i go through some bad stress for a short period e.g a day), inability to keep my eyes open when reading something that might seem stressful such as my school work which is affecting it greatly. My eyes close uncontrollably every time I read for 4 secs.
 I'm mostly worried about my school work. I've had blood tests twice which "supposedly" ruled out nothing wrong except abit of bacteria ruling the obvious UTI.
 I know you might say that I'm simply going through a UTI although i disagree. If i absorb the smallest amount of bacteria such as the typical toilet breaks, I get massive signs/symptoms of UTI. I've been having toilet breaks the same way for many years therefore there is something odd. I believe my chronic stress weakened my immune system resulting in even the smallest amounts of bacteria to be a huge negative load on my body.
 Now I've been trying to manage stress but my signs/symptoms still remain. I have so many questions. Do I have chronic stress, if so, why did the blood test rule otherwise? if not, why am i experiencing these signs & symptoms? If I have chronic stress, how long until i expect it to subside? Maybe I'm simply having all these due to my anxiety and negative thinking? Can blood tests really MEASURE cortisol or are there loop holes for cortisol to be hidden in certain factors preventing an accurate assessment?
 Hope I didin't bore anyone. I'm really desperate for help and if anyone would like to talk (if your going through the same) or just to help me then feel free to email me at: ***@****
 Thanks.
