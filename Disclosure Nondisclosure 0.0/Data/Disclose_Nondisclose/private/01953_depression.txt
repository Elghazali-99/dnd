I am 31 year old male and  taking lonazep 1mg  from 9 months and mirtazapine  7.5 from 3 months daily once  at the night for my depression , insomnia and little bit of anxiety problems  
My new psychiatrist has advised me to take oleanz 2.5 mg at night  , and buproprion XL 150mg in the morning along with  mirtazapine  7.5 at night but he asked to tapper lonazep by 0.25 mg .
he changed lonazep doses ( lonazep 0.5 mg in the morning and lonazep 0.25 mg at night ) , he said he will tapper lonazep completely in a month time.
 Every time I try to tapper lonazep dose as per my previous doctor advise I have rebound insomnia . Will Oleanz  help me tapper lonazep off ? Will it be good in treating insomina and anxiety  ?
I don't have Bipolar disorder or schizophrenia , wondering why my new doctor prescribed Oleanz  ? 
Is oleanz 2.5 mg  have less side effects than lonazep 1 mg ? is it safe follow my new doctor approach ? 
 I am afraid of some serious side effects like increase of cholesterol levels and   possibility of diabetes from oleanz  which I read on internet ,  please kindly advise me ?
