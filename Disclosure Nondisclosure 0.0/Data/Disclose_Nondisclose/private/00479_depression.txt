Hi I been in a disabling state with depression for atleast 6 months. Despite many things with health and what not happening in my life I have never felt into a depressive episode. I did have a relationship breakup and it was all going well but possibly rushing it and thinking ahead stressed me that relationship was 6 months and is now over. But months later still find myself depressed. I have always been a worry but was wondering if a possibly rougly two smokes of marijuiana triggered this depression. I didn't get physcosis just normal symptoms after use but I noticed a week or so later I got heaps of worry and couldn't sleep etc and still find myself in same situation. Could the marijuiana have triggered a depressive episode. I have tried anti depressants lexapro whic made me feel worse and I've tried others which helped a bit but also with some side effects stopped. I feel thpughts improved slightly but still suffering this depression and feel there is no way out if I go out etc I get no enjoyment so I'm pretty mch bedridden.
