I'm 18 years old, and ever since i can remember, I've always been angry. And when i get mad, it gets really ugly. Some days go by without much. However the days that I loose it....scare me because they can happen at anytime. When I get mad I quickly,and easily loose control of myself and my actions to the point of not caring what happens. My heart starts racing, I scream very loud, clench my fists, sweat, swear, curse, rant & rave, throw things, and punch things. (on a really bad day)  When my parents try and calm me down, it only makes me more angry. Just the other day my mother said something that I considered offensive to me and I began to loose it. She wouldn't stop despite my warnings to her that i was going to loose it, and I then started to "see red". Things escalated to the point where I put my fist straight through the wall. She says it's just me taking a temper tantrum, to put it bluntly. However, I really do try to hold it down, but it just boils over and there's no stopping it. Is this type of anger normal or should I be concerned at all??? Any suggestions??? thanks
