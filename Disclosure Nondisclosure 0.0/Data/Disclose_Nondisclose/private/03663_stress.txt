I am a 27 year old woman experiencing some extreme body changes. I've been experiencing a lot of sleepiness(It feel like I never get enough) along with white discharge(no odor), one of my breast have slight aches, light abdominal cramps (lower abdomen),and my period is late (two weeks and 2 days), my lower back aches extremely bad mainly in the evening. Last month, My menstral cycle switched to the first of the month(I'm usually on time every month on the same day or the next) now, I'm late again. I didn't have my period in October But it came on November 1st. I've taken a pregnancy test from the dollar store and it turned out negative. I'm not taking any birth control pills at all (but I have taken the morning after pill before about 7 months back). Every since I've taken the Morning after pill, my period has been out of control and not on it's normal schedule, but it would come on. What could be going wrong with my body? I have been extremely stressed lately. Please, Please help me Any advice?
