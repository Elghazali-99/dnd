I’ve been to my new psychologist 3 times in the last 10 days and he wants to raise my Celexa from 10mg to 40mg because he said I need to “totally relax” and be able to think clearly and that I have way too much bottled up anxiety.
I’m all for drugs but isn’t that way too much. My problem that has me there is, I drank too much and slapped my girlfriend around, I went to jail for abuse. I explained to my psychologist the long list of my life frustrations happening now; it took nearly the first hour to tell him everything wrong with my life. I only have 2 bright spots in my life right now my daughter and my girlfriend and I blew it with my girl friend. His first question to me after I told him everything was have you had your blood pressure checked? He made an appointment for me to get checked out and see why I haven’t had a heart attack. It freaked me out but he had a good point.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to connect with him and open up 100% so 
I was wondering if anyone could suggest a great psychologist in ALEXANDRIA?
