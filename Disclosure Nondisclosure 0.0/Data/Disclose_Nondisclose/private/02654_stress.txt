My wife is 59 and has no history of mental illness ---- her Mom suffers from depression and her biological sister [she has 4 other siblings] takes 150 effexor daily. Early this year our 29 year old son was diagnosed with a "giant" brain aneurysm --- my wife thought he was going to die which he didn't. He had a 9 hour surgery and is doing rather well. My wife had a period of high energy and loss of touch with reality and was diagnosed "pshchosis NOS" and was hospitalized 3 weeks and released to an out-patient care facility for 3 weeks and was taking 10 lexipro and 15 xyprexa and doing OK -- to the point of driving, Later she was taking off Zyprexa ---- then over a period of 5-6 weeks became depressed to the point of being hospitalized in June --- the meds were not effective and she had 10 ECT treatments and so far 2 maintenance [doctor is recommending more]. She is driving and responsible but does not have full range of emotions, ie -- no sadness, just pretty neutral.
and sort of empty. The doctor recommends more maintenance ---- is that wise? I read 20-50 % of ECT patients have a relapse who don't have maintenance which also means 80-50 % don't have a relapse. The only med she is on is 30mg of mirzatapine ---- can you offer any suggestions ?
 Thx, Gene
