I have been diagnosed with UCTD, and my doctor is leaning towards SLE.  I have muscle pain, muscle spasms (feet, legs, arms, neck and back, torso), bone pain, joint pain (wrists, ankles, knees, hips and shoulders) and a host of other symptoms.  I do not tolerate heat or cold well. My beautiful, talented granddaughter was in her first parade Saturday night and I missed it because the temp outside was in the 30s and I was already spasming so badly I could barely move.  I knew if I tried to sit outside in nearly freezing temps for 2 hours that I would lock up to the point I would be in agony, possibly for days. 
 My daughter is 31 years old, with 3 children of her own.  She acts as though she thinks I am a hypochondriac that just makes excuses so I don't have to do things I don't want to do.  Her comment to me when she stopped by after the parade was "Since you CHOSE not to go..."  I felt that her comment was unfair and mean-spirited, even borderline hateful.  I suppose that, technically, I did choose not to go, but I did not "choose" to have UCTD/Lupus and I did not choose to be in pain 24/7.  I love my grandchildren with all my heart and it kills me to have to disappoint any of them, but I just couldn't go.  I would love to have seen my granddaughter perform in her first parade.  
 How do you make someone understand a chronic illness and it's effects?  I have thought about telling her I don't want to talk to her until she can accept the fact that I have an illness and that I have limitations, but I can't bear the thought of not seeing her and my grandchildren.  I am devastated by her attitude, but I'd be even more devastated without her and the children in my life. What to do?
