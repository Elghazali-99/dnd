Hi!
Since the begining of my school days have found myself relatively reactive to specially noisy arguments.This had resluted in strong language and physical fights.
As I have entered into my practicle life, working in hospital led me to realize this problem again.
It is too dificult to control specially if someone use the lound tone of voice or orders.Strong trigger of negative thoughts
feel to arise in my head.And inspite realize the negative nature of thoughts I repond very violently even more strongly and sometimes ready to fight.For which I have paid heavy tolls.
          Also I have another problem seems to arise which I am ready to do anything I could do for.
While I talk to anyone I start to experience a thought comes to my mind and leads to terrible feelings very difficult to explain...and could no longer maintain eye contact. This has resluted in a poor self image.
Many friends and relatives find it difficult to initiate a talk and others dont come near me.
So concerned about this problem that I have started to look for places where I can sit in Isolation.
Please if you could help me to understand this Problem I will be highly Grateful.
Thanks
