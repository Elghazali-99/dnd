I am 15 years old and have always had anxiety which recently got worse. I am just starting to see the heavier effects of puberty (growth spurt, voice change, etc..) and just started to get extremly depressed to where i dont want to talk to friends, go to school, play my favorite sport, lost motivation, constantly wanting to sleep, always thinking about past mistakes, worrying about every little thing, and getting sad at random times. I started using marijuana a year ago but have been using it alot more in the past few months to help cope with the constant stress and anxiety but i think it may have been too much since its all i want to do anymore(i would use it every day over the summer and every weekend/some week days during school). I am wondering if the heavy marijuana use is the cause of the depression or if it has anything to do with the start of puberty since it runs in the family. The depression came after the start of my chronic marijuana use. I am going to see a therapist soon to see if i can get medication to hopefully help offset the marijuana addiction
