About a month ago I found a small lump on the left side of my neck, right in front of the muscle. It is probably about the size of a pea, maybe smaller, and very mobile, squishy, and painless. Then, about a week ago, I found another, a little larger, but about the same size as a pea, on the same side, behind the muscle. I went into full on panic mode, googled Lymphoma symptoms, and made an appointment. 
 My doctor said they are lymph nodes (I had hoped for cysts), but that though they are slightly enlarged, they are within "normal range." However, she then started asking me about other symptoms (all of which were for Lymphoma, but I don't have any other symptoms). She didn't seem very concerned, but didn't definitively say there's nothing to worry about, either, which made it 100xs worse! 
 She ordered regular blood work and said anything abnormal would show up there, but I've read Lymphoma cannot be diagnosed through blood work alone. So now I'm terrified for the results of the blood tests, but also anxious because I know even if they are normal I won't relax. She said to "come back in a few weeks if they are still there" and when I told her they had already been there a few weeks and I haven't been sick, she said to "come back if they harden, get bigger, or if I get more."
 Should I follow up and demand a CT scan? Am I making a mountain out of a molehill? Why would I have enlarged lymph nodes when I haven't been sick? I'm 24.
