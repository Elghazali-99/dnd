Hello,
I am just starting to take some zolfot to see if I can maybe chill out a bit, but I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to relax and get your mind off things?
 My hypochondira is not all health related. If I feel a slight itch in my vagina I think I have herpes. 
 I went through a phase where I thought for no reason I had bed bugs, and I stayed up nights watching them, and didn't sleep at all. I would obsessively check my skin to see if they had bitten me, and sometimes I would wake up with splotches and think they had bitten me. (the splotches went away after a few minutes)
 I also freak out and think if someone doesn't talk to me for a bit that they're mad at me. I never express these feelings to anyone or call the people obsessively, but I'll check my phone and feel absolutely heartbroken if they don't contact me. 
 One time I got ringworm from my boyfriend and I thought it was coming back everytime I felt a tingle on my leg.
 How do you guys get through this? I can barely handle it!
