I've been parading around the internet for some time now as to try to get an answer to this. I was wondering if an actual doctor knew anything on the topic so here it goes:
 When I get emotionally elevated, for example, say I'm very nervous or embarassed, or even sexually excited, my body tends to develop a non-itchy, non-painful, pinkish-red, blotchy rash on essentially my entire body, most notably my face, ears, and neck. The rash will be larger the longer I am in an emotionally-elevated state. However, it always goes away with no trouble. If I had to pick a time it happened most, I would say at night. Especially when I am up late studying.
 I don't know exactly how long I've been expieriencing it - I remember my ears turned very red and warm since I was a boy, but besides that, I am not sure.
 I was just wondering if this rash was due to an increase in adrenaline levels and that my body was sensitive to its own adrenaline? That's the most logical conclusion I have seen so far. Thank you for your time!
