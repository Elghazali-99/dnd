Hey yall.
 This girl asked to be my friend on facebook who i didnt know but lived not very far away
Then she started talkin to me online. even gave me her phone number.
She would start talkin to me as soon as i got on, and i was thinkin' she was really interested in me.
My friends were tellin me i had to ask her to do somethin sometime or i would just become another friend.
So i asked her if she wanted to catch a movie sometime and she said she was really busy that week with her 
grad party and her birthday was that weekend to so it wouldnt work so great that week.
 So i basicly took that as a no, didnt reply back to her (give her some space) and now when shes online 
she doesnt talk to me anymore.
Now I feel like I ruined her grad party and her birthday because maybe she thinks of me as different now. Like
maybe she is creeped out by guys asking her out online when i never met her in person.
 So im assuming that this is going nowhere. i just hope she doesnt see me as a creep or as a loser now.
I was thinkin about sending her a message telling her how stupid i feel for askin' her out online. 
 I know this may seem really silly but i would appriciate any feedback
