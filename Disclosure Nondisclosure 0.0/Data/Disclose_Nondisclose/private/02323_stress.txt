hi i was just curious if anyone has been diagnose w alopecia areata where you lose patches of hair....I am experiencing it again...I have been told its due to stress...I had it for 10 years.  I had a miscarriage 10 yrs ago and 6 months later i started getting bald spots...5 years later i had a daughter and my hair grew back....I got preg w my son and its coming out again...i though its hormonal but Drs say its stress....My hubby and I havent really been close for A long time...He looks at me as if i disgust him because i still have a little extra weight...when hes at work i feel so happy and can be myself  but then when he is coming home i start to panic and get so overwhelmed and stressed out because i think hes going to yell at me for something(cause he always does)I really am so close to taking the kids and leaving...My daughter always says why does daady always yell at you?  I dont know what to do.  I go to school for nursing but i am not working i am a stay at home mom.  Any advice would be helpful.....thanks
