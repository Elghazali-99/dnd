My boyfriend's daughter is 7 years old, her mother and father have been divorced for 2 years. Each has a new live in boyfriend/girlfriend. His daughter has always been kind of clingy to him, but lately the last couple months. When she is at our house, she wants to be everywhere he is, she wants to sit on his lap, she wants to lay on the couch with him, she tries to get in bed with us every night, she's afraid to sleep by herself. She doesn't like to play by herself, or really be alone at any time. She even wants to come into the bathroom to ask him questions while he's in the shower. She even offers to rub his feet or leg so she can lay with him. Last week she put her hand up his shorts trying to rub his leg, which of course she was scolded for. I'm not sure what is going on exactly, I do not have a daughter just a 4 year old son, which she doesn't seem to want to get along with either. I know that there is no abuse of any type at our home, but not sure if something is going on elsewhere and we are very concerned by her recent behavior. Any suggestions?
