In November last year I developed periodic pain in my kidney which culminated in me going to hospital in December with chronic pain diagnosed as renal colic. A week later I woke up with a burning sensation/pins and needles in both fore arms which lasted for a few hours before going away. Then during December and January the burning sensation/pins and needles spread to my upper arms and legs. The effect was mirrored i.e.  if I had the pins and needles in one arm or leg I had it in the other in exactly the same place. This effect was fairly constant with few days/hours rest-bite.
 Now since March I constantly have the burning sensation/pins and needles in my arms and legs. I can sleep and when I wake up the pins and needles are usually completely gone and then return gradually lasting throughout the day.
 I saw two neurologists in January. They did not provide a diagnosis saying that they thought it was ‘nothing sinister’ and that the symptoms would probably disappear after a few weeks.
 In March I saw another neurologist and her diagnosis was that the burning sensation/pins and needles was stress related.
 I have been under a certain amount of stress recently, what with the renal colic and immigrating to Australia in May.
 Does this sound like a stress related condition? If so can you give me any advice on treatment?
 Any help with regards to diagnosis/treatment of my condition will be greatly appreciated.
