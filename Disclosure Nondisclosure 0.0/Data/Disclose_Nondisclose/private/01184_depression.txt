I have just read an article about research in The University of Atlanta, Georgia, on people who have depression.  
 Many of us believe that brain scans cannot show if a person is suffering from depression, but this research states otherwise.
 Researchers believe that brain activity can indicate whether therapy or medication will be more effective.  Patients with low activity in the anterior insula show improvement with Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT).  Patients with high activity in the anterior insula do better with medication.
 At present the current decision on which treatment to use is based on the patient and doctor's personal preference.
 Apparently a PET scan measures brain glucose metabolism, which is animportant index of brain function.
 Whether this will ever be used in the future on people with depression is a question that was not answered.  But it is interesting to know that a brain scan can show up depression, and ways to treat it.
 What do other people think of this research?
