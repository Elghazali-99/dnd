If only I knew when to listen..I just..I just don't know why I never listen.
 So, I saw ANOTHER death clock video. It was the Universal Death Clock, where a Minecraft stage is created, that lasts LONGER than the universe itself.
 Now, it's not the idea that the universe will end. I've thought about it plenty of times before, and ignored it. It's just the fact that someone MADE a timer about it. Just thinking about the fact that the universe is TIMED, makes me feel trapped. It makes me feel like every second is just a piece of sand falling down the hourglass. 
 Yes, the universe will never end, and maybe I will never end,  but it's just so mind-boggling to be put under a time limit, and while it's a BEYOND LONG time limit, it just feels scary and gives me depression.
 I won't go on about moving on this time, since it's always like that. Of course, I will still move on. But it's little things like this that make me believe I will drive myself to insanity, and fully never be happy again. It's just..I hate this month so much. It just feels like I'm getting worse...
