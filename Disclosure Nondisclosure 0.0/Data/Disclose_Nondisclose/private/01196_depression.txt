I've been suffering for different things for a while now, my mom says it's all because of stress which I stress a lot and suffer from anxiety. Now this is what I feel. I have trouble breathing on the daily not very bad like I still go on thru my days but suddenly I just have loss of air, without exercise. I get a lot of times lately since September I starded feeling unbalanced is what I think it's called like when I feel like I'm falling or passing out but I'm not moving physically. A coworker had said I have liquids in my ears. But it scares me cause I don't feel weak of anything it's just random. Like I can stand in place and focus on something and I can tell how my head is just moving in a random pattern and it looks like in falling but I'm not physcially moving. Another thing is my heart, I have days where my heart just beats soo hard and slow that I can't sleep if I wanna take a nap. It's so hard to ignore, sometimes when it worries me it only causes it to start beating really fast like having an anxiety attack. At times I'm able to ignore it by just Paton attention to something. I've read bout palpitations a bit but I just want an opinion from someone. I also get these random numbness on different parts of my face. I also always feel nerves or vains jumpin a lot on my head or feel a lot of pressure. I deal with this on te daily. But I hAve my good days but never a day where I don't feel any of these things.. What are your thoughts? IM 23 and hate to think of death
