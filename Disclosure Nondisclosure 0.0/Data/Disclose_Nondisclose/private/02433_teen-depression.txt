So, for about a week, I've been feeling like a complete dump and I don't have any clue why. I live with my mom, but we are not close at all (in fact we can't really stand each other), so i don't really feel comfortable talking to her. I have constant headaches, nausea, dizziness, appetite loss, I can't sleep, and when I do sleep, I don't wake up until around 2pm or later when i force myself out of bed. I used to be very active, going outside everyday and skate boarding or just hanging out with friends, but recently have lost complete interest in basically all activity, even watching TV. I'm 16, and I've never been diagnosed with a mental illness (although, nor have I ever talked to anyone about myself), but between the ages of 14-15, I went through what I would call depression - I cut myself, I made an attempt on my life (tried to od on pain pills), and drank a lot of alcohol. I saw a school counselor (long story but it was the schools decision not mine or my moms), convinced them I was fine, and went on my merry way. In the past year I've gotten much better, stopped drinking, cutting, all that, and even got a boyfriend. I'm not sure if this is relevant in any way, but a week ago (same time my sick feelings started), he was sent out of state for several months to take community college classes and get his GED. Anyway, I bring up the back story because some of the thoughts of self harm have started to resurface, and while I haven't acted on them, I can't get them to stop. 
Could someone tell me if these are connected in any way, or what this could be?? I've never been like this before and if someone could give me some advice or relate in any way, that would be amazing. Thanks!!
