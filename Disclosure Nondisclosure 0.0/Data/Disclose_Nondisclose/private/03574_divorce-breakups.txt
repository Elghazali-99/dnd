My folks have been divorced for 23 years however both remarried, I'm happy for them etc. I've dealt with the whole thing fine. Ugly divorce it was but they were better off parting ways. 
 Anywho, flash forward to present. 2 years ago I got a DUI.  (I know stupid mistake, won't do it again, whole ordeal sucked) but while I was on probabtion, from January of last year until August, I kept getting stopped left and right by cops. And I'm not one to speed or anything. Always been a good driver. It was annoying!! They had the dumbest excuses for stopping me. But never got a ticket from it. I was in a parking lot once, and got harassed by one. 
 But trying to get to point, with all that, I strongly belived the judge who sentenced me was out to get me. I think she conspired with police to try to violate my probation and put me in jail for a month. Told my mother all this of how I don't many people including cops and judges. She thinks why I feel this way was because of the divorce. 
 How would my parents divorce create these thoughts on me? 
 Sorry the rant is long!!!!
