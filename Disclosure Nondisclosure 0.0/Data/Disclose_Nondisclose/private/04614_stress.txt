I had a baby several months ago and I know that moms are normally tired, but I wasn't this exhausted after my first child.  This last baby makes 3 kids now, i am married and have a full time job as a surgeons assistant for an ophthamologist. After the baby was born my doctor started me on Cymbalta for depression, and I tried stopping it once the baby was 2 months old, but found that my family liked me better, and I felt better when I was on it, so I started it up.  
 My problems are that I am always so tired, on the weekends, it takes everything I have to wake up & stay awake.  And that is even after 7-8 hours of sleep each night.  I also can't remember anything.  Can't remember to pick up dry cleaning, pay the electricity bill, what I ate for lunch the day before.  I know that I have alot on my plate, and the Cymbalta helps, but I am still so overwhelmed.  
 I recently saw my family practicioner and he prescribed Adderal for me, I tried it and basically found it to be like a Hyped up energy pill, gave me energy yet my body still felt tired, and I had trouble sleeping at night.  When I tried to explain to him how I was feeling he looked at me like he was dumbfounded.  Told me to quit my job due to the stress.  
 Had blood work done, everything was good, iron levels normal, thyroid good.  I feel like I am going crazy and don't know what will help.  any ideas??
