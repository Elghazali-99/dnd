My husband dumped me after 18 years of marrage.  I am sad and having trust issues.  i feel lonely and like I can't talk to anyone about anything, even though I have many freinds who constantly ask me to please call and talk!  
 He didn't earn money for ten years nor did he complete any of his big projects he was doing instead of earning a living.  He blames me for not supporting him emotionally, and yet refuses to acknowledge the ten years of effort and the support I provided that allowed him to not have to work a day-job, which would have also kept him from acheiving his dreams.  He left me because he got the crazy idea in his head that he'll achieve them easier without me, but he needs my money to do so, since he isn't about to start working now when he's so close to making it.  
 Women divorce support groups seem to be all about kid issues and almony (getting it) issues, but we have no kids and I'm worried about paying alimony, not getting it.  
 I want him back every day.  I can't take him back to let him treat me as an ATM either.  He's not going to come back anyway.  I want him to just come home and go back to the way things were. I greive every day over the loss of my best freind, my moral compass, my source of snuggles, my bedwarmer, my everything.
 Any help or words of kindsness are welcome.  Suggestions for people to call in London UK also appreciated.
