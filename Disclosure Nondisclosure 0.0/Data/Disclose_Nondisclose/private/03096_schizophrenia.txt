So i'm a little worried about my health Especially with my mind I constantly think about death & Suicide, somtimes i see things but when i look again its not there, i also hear little voices calling my name and when i record my thoughts i reply back to them, my mind tells me what to do all the time my mind tells me to call the police or the paramedics to take me to a psychiatric hospital, my mind also tells me to hurt my self or other people, i see things moving when they're not, i picture a monster in my head when i close my eyes, when the lights are off i see a person or i think someone is there, the main things i hate is when im in my house i think there arw loads of cameras recording me and people are watching me, when people laugh i think they're laughing at me, when i enter a room i feel like they're talking about me, and i think people are trying to kill me or hurt/attack me, i have alot of trouble falling and staying asleep i get up reall early at 7am always or in that hour e.g 7:26am like that. Is this normal? or is this Schizophrenia? or somthing else? Thank You for your time. xx
