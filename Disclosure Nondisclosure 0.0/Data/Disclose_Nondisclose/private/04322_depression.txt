SO I just have a quick question if anyone knows, but my wife has been on zoloft for the past 8 years up to 150mg for about the last year.  The doc just switched her to cymbalta since the Zoloft has not been working,  but for some reason he said to start with 30mg for a week and then go to 60mg.  Now she took the 30mg this morning but she feels like he is starting her off on to low of a dose even though it is a different drug becasue she is not feeling to good from stopping the zoloft.  Basically has anyone that is taking Cymbalta start off at 60mg first, I really don't think it is going to hurt her, but just wanted to know.  Also her sister was prescribed Cymbalta from her Phsycologist at 60mg, so we just think that our primary that put her on it just really does not understand, and he did say that she should see a professional that he does not know much about this stuff, which would explain why he is starting her off with the lowest but from stopping the high amount of zoloft causing a withdrawl.  
 Sorry for the run on sentence.
