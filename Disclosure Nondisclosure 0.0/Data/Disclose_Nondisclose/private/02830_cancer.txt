My father has been sick for the past year with stomach pains and urinary issues , on Friday he went into the dr as he had some tests done, the dr told him he has prostate cancer and they would send him in morning for surgery (biopsy) he ended up in hosp that night in so much pain and hadn't pee'd for days, at hops he was given morphine but they were not able to put in catheter due to blockage. The doctor read my dads psa and said it was 3450 (is that possible?) he said he had never seen a count that high before.  he then said the cancer would be in my all my dads bones etc and that he has probably had this for 10yrs. (my dad is 60) they did surgery and all got the cath in.. we are still waiting for results on the biopsy and the rest but does anyone have insight on something similar and the outcome ect? this is just such a shock my dad has never been sick a day in his life and now boom!!!  is this a death sentence? can he live for many more years? I am just so utterly in shock.
