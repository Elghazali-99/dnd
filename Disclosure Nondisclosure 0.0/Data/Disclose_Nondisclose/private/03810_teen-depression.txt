I am sixteen, usually in an average fair mood. i can hold conversations, my life isnt perfect, but who's is? i was going pretty well and felt great. i started taking hydrocodone (not prescribed and there is a reason its not under substance abuse) about 6 500mgs a day. not for any other reason than i could, and they made me feel good. i was recently realizing my dependency on them, and decided my best bet was to quit cold-turkey. which i did. i have been through the withdrawls completely (i think) and for a few days after felt great. but now i have began to have rapid mood swings, which is very uncommon with me. one minute im up and goin, no sleep or anything and im ready to go. then for no reason at all, there is no point in life, i cant get out of bed, why even try, im worthless and i cause misery to all those around me. and the latest thing was last night i completely and calmly sat down and listed reasons to live, and reasons to kill myself. obviously i didnt do it, but i seriously thought of it. this is completely against everything i stand for (when im in my right state of mind) so i have no idea what to think. it's almost like i am two different people, and i snap on and off for no reason. i just wanted to know if maybe this is still the withdrawls (even though its been weeks since i've been off em, and i wasnt on em for more than two months) or if this is something i should get checked out. i'm afraid to tell my parents because my dad would say well just take some more, and my mom would assume im on drugs still. i dont understand why it is that i would have such random and crazy mood swings, even though nothing is wrong in my life. so could this be the pills, or is it something more serious? please give me you're advice before i ask my parents for help, because if it is something serious i doubt they would beleive me. i'm at a loss and i dont know who to go to.
