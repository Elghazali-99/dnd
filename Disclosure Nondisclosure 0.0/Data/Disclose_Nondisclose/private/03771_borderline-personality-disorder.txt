I am 16 years old, understandably I understand that BPD is not diagnosed until the age of 18. But for around 2 years I have had persistant emptiness and rapid mood swings that are not the norm of a teenager. It started with something that happened that was kind of traumatic to me and has slightly scarred me. Anyhow, I have always worried about me doing wrong to people and them no longer liking me; When I feel that I have done wrong to a person or have upset them etc... when in theory I haven't (apparently) I get very depressed and angry with myself and cry for hours on end. Because I feel that they no longer like me. I have a specific attachment to one particular person and find myself engaging in unhealthy delusions where I will think of a situation in my mind and act it out when they are not around. No matter what it is always them helping me and letting me know that they are there for me. This 'attachment' really is starting to get to me as I don't want it there all the time, its constantly plaguing my mind. I feel highly anxious when I am around people that I know dislike me and those who I hold a grudge against, I feel that they are constantly watching me and gossiping. I was diagnosed with depression last September, however I was in deep depression. But now my moods are everywhere, I always feel empty and sad; it rarely goes above that for more than a few hours. I have a tracker on here. 
 Anyhow, thanks for taking the time to read this. I appreciate it.
