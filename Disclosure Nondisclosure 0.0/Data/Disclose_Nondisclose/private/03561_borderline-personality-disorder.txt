Okay so I am convinced that I have this after doing large amounts of research but i need a second opinion. I have asked my therapist but she seemed to think that the fact that I have such intense emotions means that I cannot be BPD so obviously she doesn't know much about it. She blamed everything else on me being severely depressed and a teenager. 
I have been self harming for over 4 years now and it has only gotten worse. I have been struggling with an eating disorder (ednos) for 2 years or so, and I have just withdrawn from school and am staying at home until I can get out of this pit that I am in which only seems to be getting worse even though I just started anti depressants. When I first found out what Borderline was all about I was ecstatic because finally something made since as to what could be wrong with me. I have become obsessed and I fit 9 out of 9 of the DSM IV criteria with varying intensities. 
I just now made an account on here but I would love someone to talk to...
