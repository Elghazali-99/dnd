I'm a 13 year old girl and I'm pretty sure I'm depressed. First off I know this is not that big a deal but I did a depression test and my level was very high so that is one reason. I often feel Lonley and hopeless. I feel alone. Like I have no one. Mostly at school. My two friends that I used to hang with... Well we kinda drifted apart. I usually just sit on the wall by myself. But these group of girls in my class ( there's about 7 of them) always feel bad and ask me to hang out with them. I usually like sitting by myself but I always say sure so I'm not rude but I just feel like I'm bugging them so I don't really talk to them. I usually only hang out with 1 or 2friends. Not a whole group. Also,my grades have dropped my writing especially. I ideally feel ignored like no one even cares about me. I don't do a lot if things I used to do. I don't go out as much anymore. I just stay in my room and sleep. And I often feel like at times I just feel like crying! At home or at school. I think a lot when I'm at home to. It's weird though because no one in my family has died I'm not really getting bullied I just feel ignored. I just feel worthless. I never really thought about suicide but have thought about self harm often. I just need someone. Please...
