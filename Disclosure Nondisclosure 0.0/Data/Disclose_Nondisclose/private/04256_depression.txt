I'm 22 years old, married, and have two children. One three years old, one three months old, and am a stay at home mom. I'm not sure if it's just my life circumstances, adjusting to two children, getting ready to move and buy our first home, lack of sleep, a teething baby, etc., but lately I've just been so irritable. Constantly moody, any little thing upsets me, completely impatient with everything, over analyzing everything and just not feeling connected to anything. I feel like I'm not connected to anything at all, my kids, my husband (although I love them all with all of my heart). I'm just so worn out. I'm breastfeeding my daughter, which is extremely demanding, and have just found myself thinking I need a break, badly, and I can't get one. I have very few options for babysitters. I honestly never do anything like dates and such with my husband, and haven't done anything with friends at all for well over a year. My "getting out" is grocery shopping or going to visit my mother, sadly. I don't know if it's simple life changes such as getting out of the house more, getting more breaks, more sleep (even though it's uncontrollable), or if it's something more serious going on. I've felt this way for a while now, probably back to when I first got pregnant (planned) with my daughter, I attributed it to being pregnant, now I'm attributing it to adjusting to life with two kids, which has been very trying for me. I don't want to keep making excuses if it's something like depression that I need to address. My husband and I have been constantly bickering lately, probably because I'm irritable, he's irritable, two kids going all day long, and moving/buying a house all wrapped into one. But, long story short, I'm so down lately, so worn out, lack of interest, so disconnected to everything, and don't know where to go from here, any advice would be appreciated.
