Within the past 3 mos. I have started having what the doctor thought might be simple partial seizures but could not be sure without proper testing.  I had an EEG that came back clean.  I also had an MRI that revealed a white spot on the back of my brain but that was otherwise clean as well.  When I was in my neurologist's office for these results she mentioned that she felt I might be depressed and that this might be causing these symptoms.  Less than week later I had a petimal seizure in my sleep that required emergency care.  I go back to the neurologist in a few days but am stir crazy about what could be going on inside my head.  I am taking Topamax to help.  I was taking Ativan but could not deal with how "slow" it made me feel.  Overall my brain feels kind of numb and disconnected.  At times I feel like I am floating outside of my body.  The "feelings" I am experiencing are very different and very hard to describe.  I am scared to be left alone fearful of another petimal seizure.  Is there anyone out there who has or is experiencing this same thing?
