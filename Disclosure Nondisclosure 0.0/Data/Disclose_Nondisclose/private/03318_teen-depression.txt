I have a 16-year-old depressed son.  This first presented itself about 3-1/2 months ago at the start of the school year.  We immediately sought help for him, first for depression.  He is seeing a therapist and then a medical doctor for medications b/c there is no real good adolescent psychiatrist in the area and if the ones that are available are booked solid for at least a month in advance.  While being treated for depression he developed panic attacks.  The doctor changed his meds about 1 month ago and all was going well for about 1 month.  But then three days ago he went into a deep funk again and for the past 2 days he has rarely got out of bed.  He is still on his meds and he knows that we are here for him...but when he falls into these deep funks he wants to talk to no one.  We are trying to give him the space he needs but are becoming extremely concerned.  We do not feel that he is a harm to himself right now...but I am being totally vigilant with him and afraid to leave the house myself.  Some of my friends and family are telling me to move on and not hover over him (and he seems like he doesn't want me to hover over him either) but I am afraid to let go. 
 He is a super bright kid and is a tremendous athlete although both his grades and his motivation to practice his sport are taking a back seat right now.  We are allowing this because we don't want to place any added pressure on him until he feels better...but I am afraid he is sinking into an abyss that he can't get out of.
 Anyone have any thoughts -- either parent or teen -- as to what we should be doing to help him?  We have done everything in our power except for having him committed which is our very last resort.
