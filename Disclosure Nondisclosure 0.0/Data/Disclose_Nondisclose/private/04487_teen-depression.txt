Hi I'm 15 years old and I think am depressed I don't really tell how I feel because people know me as cute stress free talktive bubbly chick.I don't really tell about how I feel not even my best fiend knows about me my father has abused my mom before I was born she would tell aftr he beats her again I remember when I was 2 years when me and my mom came back home after visting at my grannies it was the first time seeing my dad. Drinking water on. A friday night. My mom waS shocked 2. By the time he beat her so bad I as in my moms back he didn't even care my mom had to carry me.and wlk me 2 my granny at night well this became my dads hobby and I started living a lie. I knw he didn't do me nor my mom n sisters nothing yet when my friends told. About the goods their fathers are doing I would say somthing nice about my dad I started living in the realistic world when my mom told me they were having. Divorce am not blaming my self but I wish I had a better dad so this wouldn't be happening or I was someone els I usually cry 2 sleep. I wanna be free and. All this to stop I usually wish bad things could happen to me cause if they dfo they'll see am hurt noone has set down with me just to listen about how I feel. This life is really hard becaouse even when am visting somewhere. I wonder if they are. Fighting coz they. Or tearing each others clothes.I really need help or just to be free:(
