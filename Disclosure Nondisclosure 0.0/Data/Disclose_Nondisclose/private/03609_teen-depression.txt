I don't know how to describe what I'm going through, but it's been going on for a long time. I feel like my life is hell, even though my parents have the money to give me just about anything I want or need, and I've been raised with goodd values. I work for what I want and it makes me feel accomplished. But when I'm at home, or I'm not doing something to keep myself busy, all these thoughts keep racing back into my head. I feel worthless, I feel lazy, I feel unloved and unwanted. I have a terrible relationship with my mother and I wish it were better. She makes me feel like I should have never been born. Sometimes my dad jumps in on it too and makes me feel worse. Ive tried to go to counseling with them but they dont believe in it. I feel that everything I do is wrong and disappointing them, and all I've ever wanted to do was make them proud of me. I cry myself to sleep almost every night. And more than once I have seriously considered suicide. I have goals, and I know that i dont want to die. Every time I get to that place again I remind myself of all that i have to live for and I dont pop the pills. But I just feel like im dragging myself through life and im never going to be worth anything. I dont want to live in this hurt anymore, and I dont know what to do about it.
