(Please bare with my English)
Hey, my name is Amber... I am 18 years old...
I have a skin disease (still not sure, but it's like psoriasis)
I have took anti bio tics 1st-3rd week of May. (Last month)
I stopped and didn't finished it.
I had my menstruation 3rd week of May. (19-21)
I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend, not regularly but most of the days from May 23 to June 3
Then almost a week after, I had a very light spotting kind of a brownish/pinkish discharge.
It continued for 4 days but very light. I don't know if it's all co-incidence, but the days we're having sex is the days I'm mostly to get pregnant... And the spotting could be implantation bleeding...
And today, (June 23) I still don't have my monthly visit. 
But then, my skin disease came back... (Maybe because I never finished my anti bio tics)
So I have to be checked by a doctor... And probably would give me a new set of medicines.
And that would affect my pregnancy (if I'm really pregnant) 
And of course, my mom would be the one who will bring me to the doctor.
I don't know how to say it to my mom, or even to the doctor.
I don't know what to do...
And yes I'm already 18... But as an Asian... It's a big deal to us, to our family, and even to other people we're not related to.... I really don't know what to do...
