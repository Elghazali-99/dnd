I have been with my fiance for about 1 year. He is a bit older than me and has a daughter that just turned 14 years old not too long ago. Her mother has not been in the picture since she was 4, so he really had to pick up the slack for her not being there. He learned how to do hair, nail, shopping, and is very opened about talking about "girl things". Anyhow, we just watched a scary movie  and ever since then she thinks that there are demonds in our house. The movie scared her so much that the night after we watched the movie she didn't sleep all night. The reason I am writing this is because now my fiance is sleeping in bed with her because she is scared and this moring he had glitter all over his chest. I asked him what that was from and he told me from her shirt. I understand that it could just be that, but why was he holding her like that? I tought for some reason that was weird. They have a close relationship, but I think this is too much.. Can someone help me on this topic?
