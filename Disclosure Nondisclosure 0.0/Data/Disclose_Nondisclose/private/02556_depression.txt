Hi, 
I am new to this but not sure where to begin. I was prescribed 50 mg zoloft (over two months ago) after some depression struggles which other than not sleeping it was working great, and then because of the no sleep my doctor prescribed me 10 mg of ambien (about 1.5 months ago). It made me fall asleep but I was having issues of not knowing when I was going to wake up. sometimes it would be 5 am sometimes it would be 1230 pm (which interferes with my job) and thats even with setting my alarm and everything. I called dr and asked if I could back down to five because me sleeping in soo much. She backed me down to 5 mg ambien. But this weird sleep in thing is still happening once in a while. I am good about going to be around the same time every night. I am also experiencing this odd sense of total tiredness. I wake up and feel like I was never sleeping my legs are so tired and my body just wont get going. Once/If I get up I am okay but most of the time I fall right back to sleep and i think this could last all day. And I am sleeping well but just doing it way to much. I am having to take time off work because of this extreme tiredness/laziness I am feeling
 Any help is useful.
