My husband is not normally an angry person but every so often the smallest thing will cause him to explode, he isn't violent or verbally abusive but he will just go overboard with his response.  The issue is that after a cooling off period instead of calming down or wanting to talk it out, he seems to actually get madder and then it turns into a issue of "he has failed me as a husband, he is not good enough for me, he is packing his stuff and leaving, I can have everything and hopefully I find someone better."  At which point he starts crying and just falling apart, he loses all reasoning and it takes hours to calm him down.  
 And this response will be to any kind of anger trigger (90% of the time it has nothing to do with me). 
 For example the other day we were almost hit by a car on the freeway, so his response was to speed up to 80 (while towing a trailer and we had three kids in the back) so he can get next to the guy and flip him off and yell.  He scared me so I yelled at him to slow down, so his response to me was to veer off the road and make me drive.  Then minutes later demanded that I pull over so he could walk home (we were 1 hour away from home at this point).  During this entire outburst I did nothing, and said nothing to provoke the issue further just hoping that by time we got home he would have calmed down and realize he overreacted and I had a right to be frightened.  But instead he got out of the truck and started throwing things out of the back of the truck (we had been camping).  So I quickly sent the kids inside and the neighbor kid home.  Then he started in on the I am not good enough for you, I am leaving.  
 I have researched things like Bi-Polar, ADHD and Anger management, but have trouble fitting him to any of these things.  As most involve days or weeks of the up and down behavior or mood swings.  But my husbands are very periodical and only last about 4 hours then he is back to his normal self.
