I think my new girlfriend was sexually abused by her Dad. She is 45yrs old, says she never had sex until 8 yrs ago when she moved to Canada from Manilla. Her dad, whome she loved very much, died last year. We have had several fights that I have now figured out related to young girls in my life. My niece 21, my son's gf 18 and the 18yr old girl that cut my hair the other day. She gets into a fit of jelousy after these girls have communicated with me. 
After the last arguement she was crying and saying how much she missed her dad.I think she never had sex while in Manilla as she would have felt like she was cheating on her dad.
She has a healty sex drive, has told me from our beginning that she would never say no to me sexually, but the act itself is very mechanical, almost emotionless. 
Her jeleous rages I am assuming are due to her relating young girls to the older father type. 
I need to deal with it immediately or we will split up soon. 
How do I approach her? What should I say?
