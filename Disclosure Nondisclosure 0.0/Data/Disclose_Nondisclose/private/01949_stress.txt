I'm finally starting to wonder what's up with my dad. Some days he is very nice and seems to finally be letting go and others he's not. He has always gotten angry over little things and would ground me. Then he would turn around about five minutes later and say you can go out. He also does this with others. He is always changing his mind and he thinks that he is a calm, cool, and collected person, when really, it's very hard to predict what kind of response you will get from a normal question. As I get closer to going away to college his moods have become even more unpredictable. When I came back from vacationing with my mom, he seemed to finally be accepting the fact that I am grown up. The last few days however, he has "sweated the small stuff" so to speak and its been like a rollercoaster. Are his mood swings just from the stress of me, his first born, going to college, or are they something more. 
  On another note he has at least slight insomnia and his doctor gave him a bunch of sample sleeping pills. The pills either didn't work or they sent him to a halucination land where he saw cribbitts. He thought his girlfriend was a lion, so he tried to make her roar. Should he stop taking/trying sleeping pills? If so, what are some other methods he should try so he can sleep better?
