Im a 13 guy and don't know what to do with pretty much anything. I dont know why either, it could be any of the thousands of things that bother me. My looks, my friends, my family, socializing, workloads, finding a girlfriend. It all *****. I wind up just tearing unexpectedly and for short periods just hating anything that moved. My friends never help, they mainly just put me down. Sleepless nights are continuous.Therapist after therapist will never help either, no one can ever get to what i really think, though i wish they could. Periods of time go by when different feelings get stronger and lower, so do thoughts of ending it all though i know i never will. People may care if im gone, but for how long, everyone treats me like **** anyway and thinks there is nothing wrong with me. I am judged for anything i do and most likely screamed at for it. I am not a bad student and dont give any signs of remorse and dont even talk for that matter. No courage or self-esteem to talk to girls or make some better friends can also screw you up. Every second something inside me hurts. I hate it, i truly hate it. I dont know how to help myself and was thinking of taking a shot in the dark and puttinng my problem up here. Plz help........
