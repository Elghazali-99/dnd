Is it normal for a 14 year old boy to stay home every weekend, his school friends go to movies, bowling etc..he just stays home plays his video games looks at youtube and watches TV. He has Facebook and myspace accounts that he hardly gets on because he says they are stupid. He says that popular kids are stupid. He get straight A's  & behaves like a "nerd" but thinks he is in the "normal" crowd. I hate labeling him but I don't know how else to explain it. My wife and I are on the verge of divorce because of it. She thinks he is fine and normal. When he does hang out with friends it's always the same younger video gamer friend. We don't go to church, he doesn't play any sports so he doesn't have any kind of social outlets outside of school. He shows no intrest in being a part of anything. He wants to go to college but I think if this continue he will just want to stay home and play games all day. He played soccer for 6 years adn now he just says he hates it. He doesn't want to be a part of anything. My wife feels that it's normal to be home every weekend at 14? Am I pushing too hard for him to be with his friends or should I just let him be? It's to the point that every weekend it's a battle of me trying to encourage him to go out and my wife and I end up in an arguement. She has never pushed him to try harder, do better or be more asserative at anything, I have and I end up being the "jerk" because of it. Now my younger 11 year old son is forming the same social habbits. I don't want to divorce my wife but I can't stand by and do nothing!
