Hi...I am a stay @ home father with 4 kids (twins 4.5 yrs, 1.5 yrs and 9 wks.) All were planned except the last, but he was welcomed greatly. Happy to have my only son and very thankful!! Lost my job Oct 08 and was medically retired out of my planned career, the Navy, for Crohns in '05. Things have become hard; lots of ups and downs. Relocated in May 09 with hope of obtaining employment, but no luck yet. Now with my wife back to work, the stress has tripled, as it seems to me. We had our house broken into last summer with us all there. No one was hurt but I did escort the guy out. Don't feel like going in to that right now, but with that being said I turned to drinking, mainly at night when the kids go to sleep, to help relax and also to be able to fall to sleep with out worrying if some one is in the house. It all seems so petty but for some reason or another it is not to me. It bothers me that I drink as much as I do, especially when the stress starts to pour on. My wife let the topic of drinks go as I still maintain the house, kids, and dinner on occassion. The reason I am posting is to try to find a way to deal with this in house, due to my obligations I already have at home. Not a lot of time to just go out to the docs for a couple of hours as we really know no one here. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!!
