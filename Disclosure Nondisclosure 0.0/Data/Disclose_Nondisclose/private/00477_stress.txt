a year ago i was on zoloft after dislocating my shoulder and waking up with numbness in my  skull ... 
for 3 monthss  it was like it til i met a chiropractor who showed me proof it was my c1 and he cracked my neck into place 
3 weeks later pain was gone 
i was feeling 100 % again ... sadly i was still on zoloft 
i weened off them and always felt like my emotions were turned down a notch 
im not as scared anymore  and such 
i thought over time those chemicals would build back 
but i kept having nightmares waking up in cold sweat  i was glad though to be away from that pain 
last monday i had a stabbing feeling in my eye after having a hard week finding out my dads cancer spread 
i was slouching heaps going hard with exerise but at the same time trying to  do the right thing when i noticed my feeling are not showing as much as it should ...i should be upset  or mad   
next day someone crashed into my car and took off without leaving a note 
i felt like i cracked abit 
but i should of been more mad then what i was .... 
then i realised that stabbing feelings gotton worse  so i went to a dr and he said it was stress 
strange enough i stood up straight instead of slouching and the pain vanishes ... 
right now i have no pain but the anxiety is bad 
i never wanna go back to a vegetable thinking i was mentally sick when i wasnt 
sorry if this is messy im writing this down on a tablet
