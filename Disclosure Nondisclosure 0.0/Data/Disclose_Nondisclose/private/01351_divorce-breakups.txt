hi. I hav been with my boyfriend for over 4 years nw. We r in a long distance relati√∂nship for over 2 years. We havent had sex execpt a simple kising etc. We hav discusd abt future n he wants to marry me. He z a very nice person. He has nt cheated me except fr firtling with other which he then promised wil stop n he did try alot bt he z an atention seeker n dat i kno. Bt the problem z um nt able to trust him to 100% since i found ot he had been flirting with a girl n wich i kno he has stoped as soon as i found it though he hav never cheated on me (as per ma knowledge). Another problem z that he takes me fr granted, he doesnt do any romantic stuff. He helps me wen i need him bt only wen he founds ot that z the last option left. He cares fr me bt doesnt make me special. Dat makes me upset n sad.Wen i try to bring up these issues he get defesive n says dat i dnt undrstand him n make small things a big issue. Please help coz i know he z nice n love me bt i dnt want to be taken forgrantd
