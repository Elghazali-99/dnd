Some of you know my story, married 30 years and then he gave me the I love you but not in love with you speech and then I found he doing the deed with the 22 year old tart next door...so I havent seen him in 3 months now and life is pretty good....studying law and loving it...my son has moved back home because he wants to help me through this...the other 3 kids have been amazing....it has been there choice to not see their father....I dont talk about him at all with the kids.....So my problem is settlement....he is being a real ******* and wont negotate or even talk about settlement....when I send a letter to his lawyer we just get back a nasty letter about I did this and I did that nothing about settlement....my lawyer wants to take him straight to court.....problem....he took all our lives savings and gave me all the debt....so if I want to fight him I have to take out another loan for 10 grand because that is how much this will cost and then I am not guartantee a solution....best case I would get 200 grand and worse case I would get 70 grand...then take costs out of it I would end up with 40 grand .....so do I fight or do I just walk away and pay off the debt (40 grand) and start my life....or do I risk everything and go to court.....some advice would be great....wish I was a Lawyer now it wouldnt cost as much....
