Lately whenever I look in the mirror I'm ashamed of my body and how I look. I don't want to eat any more , I have to physically force myself to eat and whenever I do I hate myself for it and will think of ways how to get rid of everything I just ate. Including puking.  I would never act on the thought but it's still there at the back of my mind telling me I'm fat and that all I need to do is puke. Everyone tells me im skinny and pretty but I feel like there just saying that because their either my friend, family member or feel sorry for me, I know it's irrational and that I'm not THAT fat but  I feel like there's so much pressure to be a super skinny and to look the best. To make things worse im graduating from middle school and most of the girls are skinny and pretty and I keep having this nightmare that I walk up to collect my graduation certificate and everyone starts laughing at me and calling me ugly and fat and I fall over. Can someone please tell me what to do? I feel ugly, fat and not worth anything....
