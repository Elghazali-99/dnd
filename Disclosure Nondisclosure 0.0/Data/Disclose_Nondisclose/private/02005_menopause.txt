My question is regarding surgically induced menopause...I previously had a partial hysterectomy 3 yrs ago with removal of my uterus, but recently I've had to have both ovaries removed 6 weeks ago. For the 1st 3 weeks, I had nausea and no appetite-everything tasted funny...almost like metal-very hard to explain. Thankfully, it seems to have sorted itself out.
But my inability to sleep for more than 2 hrs at a time is persisting. I can't seem to sleep even tho' I am exhausted. When I do sleep for the forementioned 2 hr intervals, I wake up  feeling like I am burning up from the inside and some pain around the incision site-which is still swollen. Then I am really cold.  This is happening over and over again.
Emotionally, I get weepy and impatient. I am having headaches and have no ability to focus, which is worrying since I am due to return to work in a week:-(  Are these all symptoms of ovary removal  or am I developing hypochondria? My doctor started me on a low dose of Estrogel but it hasn't been a week yet. Can anyone confirm my symptons and know how long does it take before I notice improvement? I didn't feel this bad after my last surgery. This is really nasty!
