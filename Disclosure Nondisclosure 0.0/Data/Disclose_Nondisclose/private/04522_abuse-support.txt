I'm twelve years old. I used to live with my mother and father and my half brother came to visit every once in a while. Whenever my brother wasn't home it was hell. My father was constantly beating me and my mother but only where it could be hidden up by a sweatshirt or jeans. He forced me to do things that were awfull and if I tried to fight back he'd just beat me. Sometimes I wasn't even aloud to go to school! This happened to me and my mother. He sexually, mentally, and physically abused us. One day my mom tried to fight back for both of us and my father got really angry... My mom now basically lives at the hospital and has for about 2 years. My dad is in jail and I live with my 29 year old brother. I cry all the time now just thinking about it. I don't even know what to do sometimes. The things my father said to me I still think about and sometimes a agree. I've been to therapy and everything but it's just not enough I don't know what to do!!! I'm thinking about killing myself I've fought long enough and I'm ready for everything to be gone. What should I do? Xoxo
