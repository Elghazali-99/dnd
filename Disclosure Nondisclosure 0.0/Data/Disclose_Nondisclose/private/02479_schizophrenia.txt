Ok so this might not be the right place to post this question but it's close enough. So ever since I was a kid like 3 or 4 I would hear like my mom's voice sometimes but she wouldn't be there it didn't happen frequently but it's happened a lot through out my life. I'm 18 btw. But it's happening a lot not like everyday but now it's like I hear conversations and the people I think I hear aren't there. To clear things up none of the people I hear are dead there alive and well. And when hear the voices I don't exactly hear them my head but through my ears kinda like they're right there. Like when I'm in my room or alone in the house I can hear my mom talking and it sounds like she's in another room and I can hear her clear as day but she's not there. Also I sometimes I hear my phone vibrate and I can feel the vibrations coming from it but when I check it there's no call or anything. I don't know if this is serious or am I just paranoid. But I feel I should share other things to help figuring out what my problem is like I suffer from depression. Also ever since I was little I had really terrible thoughts about killing and what not I also smoke weed but not a lot. I know I should ask this somewhere else but my head feels crazy it doesn't hurt at all but it feels... Kinda hard to explain but I'll do my best it feels heavy in a way or like it's just too much going on up and feels like it wants to explode or hurts when I try to think been feeling this way for some months now, so if you can take a guess at what that might be I would be very appreciative. Ty for taking the time to answer. :)
