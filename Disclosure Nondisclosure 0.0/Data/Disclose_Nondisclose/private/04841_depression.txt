When i was 8 yrs old my step-father started molesting me,it continued until i was 17 yrs old. I was a shy kid. The last time he tried i finally had the guts to hit him square between the eyes and tell him to get the **** out of my room,my mother had just gone into her room so i knew she heard me,she didn't even bother to help me.
 My sister and I told my mother at the end of the school year that year,she didn't believe us and to this day she still doesn't believe what he did to us. He recently died on July 18th,2009 and he took it to his grave with him and never admitted the truth to my mother. My mother calls me crying because she lost her husband and i have no sympathy to give to her.I sit and listen and it makes me sick she can grieve over a man that has caused her children so much hurt. My life has been hell because of him. Emotionally i am a wreck. I have been to counseling 3 times but it doesn't help.
 My mother and i have been in so many fights over this,today she calls me and starts putting my husband down because he won't say he sorry she lost her husband, I told her he is protecting me and he doesn't have to say anything to her. She asked me some of the details of what happened to me by my step-father and i told her the details,she couldn't even tell me she was sorry but she made a point of telling me the only way she would believe me is if i took a lie detector test,I am her daughter i shouldn't have to. Why would i lie for 29 years? I am 46 yrs old and it makes me sick that my own mother doesn't believe me. She doesn't even remember the right time i told her she said it was after i ran away and it wasn't. 
 My step-father was a abusive man he not only did he beat us but molested me and my brother and only touched my sister and her friend once. My brother left and went to live with my real dad because of my step-dad.
