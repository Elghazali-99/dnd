I have had problems with depression/anxiety symptoms for years, the latter being much more prevalent, though I have never been treated with medication or diagnosed with anything.
I also have major problems with anger. I am concerned because my anger feels irrational and overwhelming (much like my anxiety), and it overpowers my perception. For nearly no reason at all, I will get furious and feel deep hatred for myself and everyone around me. I usually take it out on my family and friends by screaming at them and acting like a complete nutcase. It feels unavoidable when it happens. Today I became angry, and I think I genuinely frightened my mother. I would never hurt anyone physically, but sometimes I honestly feel like I could. In the past these feelings have led me to cut/binge and purge/etc.
After an angry spell, I feel exhausted and drained. Then my mood does a 180, and I feel great/ashamed at my previous behavior/unable to understand it.
Am I just an angry person who needs to learn better coping methods (though I have tried deep breathing to calm down, it NEVER helps), or could I have some potential problems I need to look into? I am sick of being this way because it hurts me and the people who matter most to me. 
I have never used this forum but hoped I might get some helpful responses.
