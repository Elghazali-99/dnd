My name is ace.... Not a joke it's my real name.... I'm 17 and male.. I have always been very low in confidence due to constant ridicule and harassment when I was younger and it followed me through the years.... I felt so alone for so long like nobody cared like nobody could possibly care about a useless **** like me... I had a girlfriend for a time. She was beautifull she ment everything to me absolutely everything I treated her like a queen like my goddess I would give her anything and everything for nothing more than her compassion. We were together for a long time but then.. Then she got tired of me. I don't know why I treated her so well but she felt like I was not aggressive enough I guess I don't know. I was so nice I never raised my voice to her never called her a bad name and never tried to control her....but she still left. After that I've felt more alone than ever. I didnt think I'm that ugly. But I just can't get s grip. I just want someone to care about me. I want someone to tell me I'm worth something I want someone to care if I'm hurt or if I get hurt or if I die... I just want someone to talk to me I just want someone to listen to me. I don't know if it matters but I'm 160 pounds and ling hair... I just want someone to care about me. I want something I just want to feel again....
