Hi everyone. My question is can crying and stress harm the baby. Not the crying that last for a moment but the deep crying that makes you feel broke down? My stress is about my husband me being a stay at home mom finances and plus chasing my 20 month old around. I really just want a break but no one acts like it's a big deal and I'm made to feel like since I'm a stay at home mom that I'm not supposed to have a break. Honestly I would rather work a job then stay at home all day I find it more stressful and tiresome than working. I love being home and being a mother that takes care of her home and child soon to be children. I just wish that my 24/7 job was taking more serious. I feel more like a house slave then anything because not only am I picking up after myself and child I have to go in behind my husband and pick up his trash put food back in the fridge or throw whole packs of sandwich meat out. Clean up his clothes out of the floor or hair off the sink after he's shaved. I just don't feel appreciated at all. Plus we have a garden and I'm expected to keep up with it too plus cook.  It's a lot of work especially when there is little help or when someone says I'll get it and sits for 3 days waiting on him to get it. I should have just did it myself because now it's in worse condition. Sorry for complaining I just needed to get it out because I can't talk to him because he just tells me I'm wrong and that he wished he had it easy.
