I was hospitalised for 3 months 4 years ago with clinical depression and have been hospitalised 5 times since (some combination of high anxiety, psychosis and suicidal), though only once this last year and I certainly feel things are improving and there’s times when I am feeling much more positive again. 
 I also got tagged a year or 2 ago with Borderline Personality Disorder (I think by 2 different psychiatrists on different occasions who only saw me briefly for assessment), a diagnosis that I have a problem with. I am a high achiever, have had a long successful career both professional and sports, stable, long term relationships (19 years) and family, no problems at all with keeping stable friendships and acquaintances, I don’t swear, I’ve never raised my voice in anger or get angry with anyone, am totally non-impulsive (my brain works too logically and quickly to do anything ‘rash’) and am very adept socially etc. I don’t emotionally react in any extreme ways and if anything is the problem it is because I am too calm! I don’t think any of that ticks the main boxes for BPD unless they count internalised anger or what goes on inside my head? In which case wouldn’t everyone be diagnosed with BPD for what they sometimes think instead of act?
 Anyway, getting to the point, my care professionals are now considering putting me on mood stabilisers and I don’t see why as I don’t get ‘moody’. Should I be being treated for BPD? 
 My current meds are venalvaxine, mitazapine, amisulpride.
