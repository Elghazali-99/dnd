So my husband and I have been married for 7 years. Last year we got into a huge fight and I suggested a separation. To be honest I didn't think it would last this long. He moved in with a female coworker. They've done things together,  gone places together but he always told me they were just friends and I believed him. Two days ago he told me that he's been seeing her for the last 6 months. He said he couldn't bring himself to hurt me so that's why he waited so long. That night on the phone I said anything and everything to make him see that I would change and that we can be happy and I meant every word of it. As I was crying and telling him these things he started to cry and I couldn't understand why. If he's happy like he says he is then my crying shouldn't bother him right? He still tells me to this day that he doesn't know what he wants. I want to work this out and have the chance to prove to him that things will not be the same. I won't treat him the way that I did. That I will respect him as an equal and show him that his feelings matter. I want to know if I have a chance to make things right and if so what can I do it increase my chances?
