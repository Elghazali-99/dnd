Hi I would be very grateful if anyone could help with advice. I'm 37 weeks pregnant and under mental health services, but I keep having my diagnosis changed. About five years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as i had extreme highs and extreme lows, but the psychiatrist at the time retired and within five minutes of meeting my new one, my diagnosis was changed to borderline personality disorder. since then it's changed several times and i have even been told i have both? Now i'm worried because i'm due to have my baby girl soon and my mood has gone down quite bad. I have found myself pushing family away because they annoy me by blaming everything on my 'mental health', they forget i am a person i think!. I'm having anxious thoughts that i have to be supermom, i don't want people touching my baby, or taking over, i'm scared that people will take her away. paranoia is horrible and just getting worse as the birth draws closer. I'm not insane at all, but i am concerned that i have gone on such a downer. i feel so sad, no energy, hopeless. Previous to this i had bursts of energy, felt irritated and felt i was going to be supermom, that i didn't need anybody. I am so confused, i don't know what is wrong and my family never listen when they have wronged me, but when i have wronged them, it's rubbed in my face it's my mental health. Any suggestions? Thanks
