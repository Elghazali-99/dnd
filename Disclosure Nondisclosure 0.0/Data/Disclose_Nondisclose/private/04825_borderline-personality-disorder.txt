Hi all, my question isn't entirely about BPD but I was hoping I could get some answers here anyway. I've been taking 100mg of topamax daily for about 6 months to help control my extreme moods and it was highly effective. I tolerated it extremely well, my only side effects were that I got tired more frequently and it killed my appetite. I'm a college student and I just moved back into my dorm this week, and like the idiot I am I forgot my topamax at home which is a two hour drive away. (Along with my wallet but that's another story entirely). So I've been forced to go cold turkey from it until I can talk to the psychiatrist here, who I won't have an appointment with for at least a week. (I can't even make an appointment until I get cleared by the counselor tomorrow)
 I've been experiencing itching all over my body for the past few days, particularly intense in my arms. (I've had a fixation with my arms in the past, however, particularly with SI) I've also been experiencing tingling in my extremities. What I want to know is, could this be the topamax withdrawal, or something else? Does anyone know anything that could help me with this? Thanks in advance.
