My wife of nearly 4 years has BPD.  Many of you with a spouse/significant other with this condition have seen how a BPD's perception is not always based in reality.  This disconnect with reality seems like the primary cause of our arguements and marital problems.
 Our arguements usually begin when my wife has raised her voice and then cursed at me/insulted me and I have the immediate reaction to raise my voice back at her.  However, when this happens, she acts as though she has been quite and I am the one who is raising my voice.
 This might be far fetched, but it seems to me that the best way to handle this is to setup a voice recorder in the house to "prove" to her that she is being verbally abusive and that it is unreasonable for me to be insulted and simply cower to her raised voice and insults.  Furthermore, if she really believes that she isn't being disrespectful, this might open her eyes to her condition and how it impacts me and our marriage.  Please let me know if any of you have any suggestions on how you have dealt with BPD problems.  Thank you.
