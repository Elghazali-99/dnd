My name is Lauren, I am 15 and I have been diagnosed with depression, extreme anxiety, extreme stress and I might be bipolar.
I have been cuting myself for about 6 months now and no matter how hard I try I cant stop. I have lost so so many of my friends because I hurt myself but I cant stop it. I tend to shake alot and I try to make myself throw up, in order to be skinny. I am a dancer and its my life but I feel im not good enough, just like im not good enough at anything and im not good enough for anyone. I feel to fat for anyone. I feel to depressed to make others happy and so I keep to myself but then I get yelled at because I cant open up. I am very vonrable and guys have just used me my whole life. I want to be happy but as soon as I start to smile again something rips it away and makes me depressed again. I cant cope with it anymore. I have been seeing a therapist for a few months now but it doesnt help. I might need medication because yesterday I had a massive anxiety attack at school to the point of the doctor wanting to call the ambulance. I cant do this anymore. No one loves me and no one cares. I hate when people say they will never leave me but then after they find out I hurt myself they go so fast an it kills me even more. I dont know what to do... :'( I dont want to be here anymore. 
 The photo is when I first started cutting and now its all down my arms and I have scars from my legs.
