I am 22 years old.I am with my husband for 7 years...I dated him for 5 years and I am married with him for 2 years.I used to trust him blindly.And he never cheated me.Even he got many sexual offer from girls but he was never interested.But recently I found it that he is watching at girls nude pictures.When I asked him at first he told me that it was not him but his friends did it from his laptop...Later I asked him strictly and he told me that actually he did it and told me that he just randomly went to those pages and he does not have any sexual desire to those girls and even he does not get excited.To prove his words he told me to play a porn.When I did it I saw that after even watching porn he did not get excited.Then why did he go to those pages?What can be the reason?I am so much confused.Should I trust him or not?It is not like that he went to those pages once but several times...He can not explain me why or I am not satisfied with his answer.Can a guy look at these type of picture just for nothing?He is attracted to me and we have great sex life.But after this issue I am thinking that he does not love me and I am not enough for him.Please help me.What should I do?Is he telling the truth or not?
