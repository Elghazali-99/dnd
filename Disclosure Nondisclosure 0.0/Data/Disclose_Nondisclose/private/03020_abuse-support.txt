My wife of 8 years is experiencing a period of depression, she has PTSD and is borderline personality.. I am slowly beginning to become unattatched with my feelings. I want to stay married to her, it is becoming so hard to keep supportive of her. Sometimes she will become very abusive, yell, repeat demeaning and humiliating comments about me or my family. Nobody is perfect, and my family is no different than the mildly wierd.  She was mentally, physically and sexually abused when she was younger. Her 1st husband was also a controlling, manipulative man with temper issues ( I know him to be that way today) 
I have big shoulders and want counseling, but she claims she controls it herself. When I talk with her about the things she says and the unfair way she treats me, she somehow turns it all around and makes me feel weak, guilty and childish. Basically I want help for her, but need to make it somehow me seeking help for myself and  ask her for help in that? 
Today, I need to encourage her and give her positive things to think about. I know that, Im starting to hate my role in our marriage.
P.S. I still believe our marriage is worth saving
