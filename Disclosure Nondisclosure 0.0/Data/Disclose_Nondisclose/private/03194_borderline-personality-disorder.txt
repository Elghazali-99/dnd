I thought it is normal to cut yourself when you feel sad or angry with yourself. Seriously. I mean you just cut yourself, cut and cut, it will heal although it might leave a scar, but then it's not like you're hurting someone or something. It's not supposed to be such a big deal. When i was young i got hit a lot by my mom even for simple things, and although she is a great and loving mom now and i really love her dearly but i guess it affected me somehow. 
And 'just in it for the chase' relationship where you only like chasing someone and when he finally likes you, you lose interest in him, like it's no fun anymore, can it be counted as a symptom? Because of this i haven't had a boyfriend for 18 years of my life. And to immediate change of mood from love to hate towards your best friend because she did something you didn't like till the extent that you regret having a friend like her although before that you were having a great time with her, doesn't everybody do that or is it not normal too?
I don't know. I'm just confused. I wanna get help and i wanna change myself. Who should i see..a physician or therapist or psychiatrist?
What should i do
