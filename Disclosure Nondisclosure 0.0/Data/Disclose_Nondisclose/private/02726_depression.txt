I am 25 year old male. On 5th Nov 2012 I visited brothel and had sex with Pro. After that I was worried about HIV then I convinced my self that I could not get HIV since I used a condom. Then I got worried about STD, then infecting my parents. I was in total mess.I was feeling so guilty after that event happened. I have been sleeping sleepless nights and I have cried almost everyday since that incident. I have thoughts of suicide, morning nausea and Crying spells almost everyday. This is hampering my work and personal life. I have even told my parents regarding the visit (I live with them) and 7-8 friends regarding the incident. They all especially my parents are very supportive. They told me dont worry it happens. But now after all this I have a strong feeling of guilt, regret and shame. I mean who tells their parents of all this things. I tried to commit suicide today but withdrew it thinking about my parents. I am their only child they love me so much they can not survive without me. I told them weather I can consult some therapist but  they were strictly against it..they are under the impression that it is for mad people. I am very grateful for  the love and support they have given me in this time of mental adversity. What needs to be done in may case? Its been more then 20 days and that incident is still haunting me. It was my first time and I think I did a terrible mistake by visiting a cheap brothel. Please help.
