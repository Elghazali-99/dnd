I have a question for anybody who has gone through, or is currently going through perimenopause.  10 months ago, right after my period started I had vaginal irritation.  I have had many yeast infections in my life and it was really nothing like a yeast infection.  There was no discharge and I never really had the urge to itch.  It was more of an irritation or burning sensation.  My doctor advised me to treat it with Monistat just in case.  It didn't go away and so he gave me metrogel (after negative tests!) to try just in case.  Well, 10 months later I am still having this irritation.  It gets worse the first few days after my period ends.  I am 40 years old.  My cycle went from 28 days on the mark to 26 days, and now I am down to every 23 days.  But, my doctor says that because I am still having my period, it can't be low estrogen.  I have noticed some vaginal dryness as well (especially after my period ends)  I'm wondering if this vaginal irritation might have something to do with menopause.  My Mom was done having her period by 42 years old. Please advise.  I am at my wits end here.  It not only is uncomfortable physically, but it wears on your mental state when you constantly think something is wrong with you.  Thanks in advance!!
