I am 14 im not sure what to do any more. my little sister bothers my a lot and I have very dark and mean thoughts but when I have those thoughts I cant help it but hit her or hert myself. Now when my friends come over all I want is for them to leave. I get angry over little things and I cry for no reason. I have never tried suicide but I've thought a lot about it like how would my family feel, that's what has been holding me back. I don't want to tell my dad how I feel because I don't want him thinking that its for attention. the past 3 years I've been finding more about my family like my mom has 3 other kids that I didn't know about. I have not been In the same school longer than 3 years and my grades are lower than they have ever been and I don't know what to do about that because I've been held back before and don't want it to happen again. I use to love drawing, art, and music but I don't even look at my paint brushes or my guitar any more. but im lost and I need help
