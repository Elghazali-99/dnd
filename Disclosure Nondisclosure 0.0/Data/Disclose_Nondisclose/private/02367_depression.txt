I am a 21-year-old woman who suffers from immense menstrual symptoms. I am perplexed with the length in which these symptoms last. Two weeks prior of my menstrual cycle, I start to experience abrupt feelings of sadness, depression, or anxiety; sometimes there are reasons for them (whatever it is that elicits these feelings doesn't bother me as much on a regular day), other times, there is no actual reason, it's just a strong pang of hopelessness or anxiety. I notice I may cry over nothing, it could actually be because of the overwhelming emotions coursing through me during this time. What concerns me is that normally, or from what I've heard, PMS or PMDD occurs before the menstrual cycle. Some women experience symptoms during, but I noticed I experience symptoms throughout almost the entire cycle. It really, really bugs me, and there are times where I cannot stand what I am feeling and I shut down and want to hide away from everyone and everything. I overthink, I get confused easily, I get emotional over strange things, I become irritated easily, it just drives me nuts.
