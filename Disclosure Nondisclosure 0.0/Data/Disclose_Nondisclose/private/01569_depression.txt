I've been bullied and left out by everyone else since I was a little kid. I've always struggled with social anxiety disorder and I find it hard to connect with anyone because I'm afraid to even look people in the eyes. Some time ago I hurt my only close friends' feelings on purpose and also started cyberbullying people because I couldn't find other way to deal with my emotional issues. I know I don't have any excuse for such behavior. I also know I'm a horrible person because of what I've done and I don't deserve to live anymore. I feel bad for anyone who's struggling with any kind of disorder because I know I deserve to be suffering, not them. I deserve to be fighting with cancer, not some poor person who hasn't done anything wrong. I deserve to be cutting myself or fight eating disorders. I feel worthless, I feel like I don't have any reason to live, I feel I don't deserve to be healthy or happy. This hatred I have for myself it's dragging me down every day and I can't get over it
