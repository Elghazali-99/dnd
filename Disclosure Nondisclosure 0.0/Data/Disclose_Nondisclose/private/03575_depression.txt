Was in an auto accident with much trauma.  Had a proving career with excellent salary!  The auto incident resulted in not able to return to my job, 2 total breakdowns, over 4 years of not knowing who I was, married 12 days after incident (unvoluntarily), losing total control of my life (attorney's had Dr. state I was incapable of taking care of myself), loss of my 401K (went to my then husband), Physci. put me on  many different drugs (including effexor) (mind altering drugs) and many many more instances that I could go on!  I was able to get off so many of the drugs that the dr.'s put me on!  But every time I try to stop taking effexor I think I might die!  I'll be 70 soon and have been on this drug for about 17 years.  I have been absent from my children's lives, my siblings, lost my Dad now my Mom!  I'm probably the saddest person in the world and have no reason to be at this time in my life.  When I die I will go Home to be with the Lord.  I have spent the last 15 years in my Bible.  I know without a DOUBT I will go to Heaven.  I've already been to Hell and I am not a candidate for that place.  It's sad because you are all alone in a very packed world.......and no one really cares at all!  Crazy people do know God and He cares.  
 If there is anyone out there that can make an executive and truthful decision..........help me...........!  I want to get off effexor before something happens to me where I can't tell a Dr. that I'm on this medication.  I have suffered in silence but don't think I could suffer laying somewhere and can't tell them why I'm in so much pain!  Can you help me?
