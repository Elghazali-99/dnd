Well, mental illness totally changed my thinking. Well, I am from developing country and later i moved to Australia for study purpose where i realized that i am ill. But when I was in my country, I was fully superstitious, over spontaneous, highly religious. I used to go to fortune teller many times. I used to see zodiac everyday, I  used to think i will marry pure and virgin lady. That type of stupid concept we have in our country. When i came in Australia, I realized s*x is not always sweet it's painful too. So i did s*x around 1000 times and started to gain 40% pleasure. but it was zero at the beginning and very painful. This mystery has so much changed my thoughts that today i want to marry hardcore porn or prostitute. Today my thinking is just opposite than my past. I started to realize that love does't exist in body. Suppose if my wife got vagina cancer or breast cancer so she will be obviously porn or prostitute cause she needs therapy to survive. Then what is the meaning of jealousy? Life is dare of die. So western world is forever and ever naked. Next I got different thought about religion. Everybody has god picture in their brain. Is it necessary to draw the picture or tell or show? When we show the god or name it then conflict comes? SO it is not necessary to create religion. When i am in trouble, i remember the god but i don't remember any god or religion which is created by human. So this definition made me life time non religious. Next about love , we shouldn't love too much. Because love is just a lovely word when cruelty circulates in our body and i eat animal everyday. My medicine is made with  animal so it's expensive. SO it's very shame to talk about love for me. Next I am life time no superstitious. 
Does mental illness changed your thoughts either? My thoughts are dangerously changed. Cause the definition i was given is so good and i am madly in love with these thoughts.
