I'm trying to understand if depression is a condition we're born with or a condition of how a person is feeling. Does it always have to be related to a chemical imbalance?
 Examples
 Question 1.
Someone is wrongfully sent to jail. They know this will be their whole life and no retrial. They cry every day about being caged. There is no sign that this sadness will end BECAUSE every day they wake up in the same jail. In this example the JAIL is causing the HURT. It never goes away because the situation causing it is constant. Is that depression?
 Question 2.
While jailed this person will repeatedly try to commit suicide, not talk to anyone, not want to eat. This person is not able to adjust to jail. This has been going on for 2 years. Is this depression?
 Question 3.
Finally, evidence shows they were wrongfully charged, and released from jail. Their sadness and pending doom is completely gone the instant they heard they were to be set free. Can depression just end on the spot like that with no sign there ever was depression days, years before?
 Question 4.
Finally, while in jail, would antidepressants help this person cope with being stuck in that situation what was unchangeable?
