Most of you know my story so I wont bore you with details.....as you know I have been going quite well, still lonely but happy.....then the ex rings son about seeing the family dog and I said no .....then he rang the daughter (who he never talks to) he said to her dont tell your mother.....he repeated it 4 times dont tell your mother...that he was taking the mower from the farm.....my daughter rang me straight away and told me.....I said why would I care...she said it was really wierd it is like he kept saying dont tell your mother...my son  said to after his visit with his father, you are going to have to talk to him one day.....then my friend said he is finding every excuse to get you to talk to him.....do you think this is true.....what should I do....I want my kids to be happy....I miss what we had...but I could never trust him again and I am sure I do not want him back....should I just ignore him.....and continue to talk through the lawyer....I really dont want this is my life.....what to do.....thankyou dear friends....
