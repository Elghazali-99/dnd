Hello, I am 16 years of age and I have lost control of reality. I weigh 180lbs and I am 6'2" tall. I DO NOT take drugs nor drink alcohol (wine at Sunday supper). The best way I can describe my symptomes is like a 'haze' you get when you come out of a weed high (I used to smoke socially, 5 months clean) and you don't really remember what has happened, only bits and pieces. Well, it is annoying and very scary, it is my reality. One minute I will be perfectly fine, 100% healthy feeling, the next minute I will be ripped from reality and put into 'dream'. Sometimes when I am sitting in class this will happen, I won't be able to understand plain english or read it. I have also had an occasion when I walked my friend home. After I got to her doorstep everything felt 'fuzzy', next thing I knew I was halfway home and I could barely remember my visit with her, let alone walking her home. The most recent incedent was today. I was on the phone with my girlfriend. My mind went a bit fuzzy and I ignored it and we continued to talk on the phone. Part of my mind told me this was realiy, the other part told me 'it is only a dream, when you wake up it will all be fine'. I started being an ******* towards my girlfriend, the world around me seemed to droop and become a dream. On one end of the phone my girlfriend was in tears, on my end 'I' was pushing and proding her, getting her more upset as the 'good' part of my mind told me to stop. This time I managed to grab on and stop the 'dream' ... I am lucky that I have an understanding girlfriend who has helped me through this issue before. I NEVER want to hurt her, mentally or physically.Please help me, I am terrified of what is happening. I like to be in control of my mind...I dislike when my control is broken. Please help. Thank you.
