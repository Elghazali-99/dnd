Where to start , I went prison in 2009 i did a voluntary section 6 months later for low mood/Suicidal thoughts..... I got released from hospital by my next to kin writing in and i went to live with my dad, Things are just getting worse and worse, I worry about everything until the point of not being able to leave my house , i get scared alot and sometimes i think that there is a ghost or something in my room so i keep looking round to see if there is anything there, Most of the time i find it hard to get to sleep ... Another thing is that very rarely but it is happening more often now is that i suddenly get abit dizzy and everything seems to be going slow and seems extremely loud , My movements seem faster and it is just extremely horrible , When i am walking does the road and there is cars driving past i feel as though the drivers are laughing at me i feel as though most people are laughing at me to be honest, If someone walks past me in the street i look at them to make sure that there not laughing but for some reason i always think that they were taking the mickey, So i always look back and see if they are looking at me but most of the time there not, One of the worst things is when i go shopping or something and its busy i feel asthough im going to wee myself and even when i dont as i never have before, i see people laughing/ smiling and i put my hands down my pants to check if i have peed myself, I have a girlfriend and i do not have a clue how she copes with me, I get really paronoid accuse her of cheating , I go mad at her when she doesnt do anything wrong, for instance ig she goes to the shop and gets something wrong i get really mad, and also when she holds my hand or like strokes me i dont like it i feel weird and move so she isnt touching me anymore. I was taking 1mg of rispiridrone twice a day and 20 mg of citalopram a day but have stopped taking them because when im on them after a while i feel like oh i dont need them anymore and then a few days later it gets worse so i tried to take them again but i get scared because the anti depressants take long to work and make me feel worse and dont like rispiridrone because it makes me sleepy and i hate it because it takes too long to get use to, I have also tried flluxatine ( Anti depressant and anxiety tablets) but dont take them anymore, Im really getting scared of life and thinking that everyone is out to get me if i had a confrontation with someone i would probably stay in my room and think someones going to kick my door of and get me and get really worried, as i am only 18 i hope someone can help because i cant live my life like this. I know i should go to the doctors but my anxiety stops me from walking there i get scared. The only time i feel safe and everything goes away is when it is dark and raining/storming even if im in bed i get up get ready and go for a walk in the rain it makes me feel better and normal. Please help thankyou
