Well, im a 13 year old girl and im pretty sure im depresed. I have lost intresst in things i loved, i dont understand anything in school anymore even though i understood it perfectly days before. I sleep far to much and i hear myself telling myself that im an idiot who is pathetic and stupid. I was never popular and within months i have stopped caring about my grades and i can hardly spell anymore. It started when my best friend moved away (we were freinds for 7 years) and now shes gone to europe for 4 years. I  dont want to tell my parents because i dont want them thinking that they have done something wrong when they raised me and i dont want them getting worried. I went to the hospital but they told me to call a help service. My school psychologist thinks im just bummed and said i'd be fine but i think its getting worse i've started wondering about suicide. I've been like this for about a year now. Im always tired and i hate myself. Im want to kill etiher myself or everyone else. I've taken lots of tests online and all of them say im depressed. Before i thought i'd get better now i know i wont.
