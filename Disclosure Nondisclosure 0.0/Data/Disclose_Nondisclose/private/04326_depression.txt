Sorry if this question has been asked before. I've been looking on various websites for information but I can't seem to find any definite answers to this: How long does Effexor XR withdrawal last? I understand the time frame will be different for everyone, but I'm assuming there is a general window that most people fall into? A few weeks? Months??
 Some background: I've only been on anti-depressants for four months. I was first put on Zoloft while I was inpatient for an eating disorder, but it didn't seem to do anything. Two months ago I was switched to Effexor 150mg/day, as well as Neurontin 900mg/day. I just recently got off the Neurontin, and a new psychiatrist suggested coming off the Effexor and taking Prozac instead. I decided against that and thought it best to not be on any medication. I started tapering the Effexor (150 to 112), but after a few days of awful headaches and apathy I decided to stop it all together. YES, TERRIBLE DECISION, I UNDERSTAND, I DON'T NEED A LECTURE. Of course, I thought I was a little tougher than I really am...these withdrawals are really quite scary. I'm just wondering how long I can expect this to go on for. I think I'm nearing 72 hours without Effexor and symptoms seem to be getting worse, not better. First I had some tingling in my right hand, and now I'm having full blown 'brain zaps' through my whole body. I feel like my head is full of sand (or my ears? It's a strange feeling) every time I move even the slightest bit... also nausea, sweating, vertigo, irritability, sobbing, hopelessness, anxiety, etc. etc. etc. I know this is my fault for not tapering, but that's not the point, as I'm not about to start taking it again. Does anyone else have a similar experience? 
 Also, is withdrawal from this drug "dangerous?" What exactly is going on in my brain that makes it feel like I'm being electrocuted every few minutes? I'm afraid of doing some kind of permanent damage.
