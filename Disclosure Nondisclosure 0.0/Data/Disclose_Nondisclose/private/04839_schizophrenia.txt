Please give me your informed opinion....my sister, who has never been truly happy with herself, has had an episode. For starters, she has been under tremendous stress (family related, money, husband laid off, LIFE.) Historically, very low self image, has thought people do not like her, are talking about her. She has always had a hard time maintaining relationships. She bounced around, from job to job for ever so long. But, about five years ago began working at an office and has been there since. Well, as of a few days ago, everyone at her office hates her and they are trying to publicly humiliate her and fire her. She believes that they have bugged her house, filmed her and her husband having sex, and recorded various conversations, using all of this against her in some way. She has not slept for any real length of time in several days, nor has shed had much at all to eat. She that she "wants to crawl under a rock." There is a long history of verbal abuse and emotional neglect during childhood, if it makes any difference. Not sure if she just cracked from all of the stress, of if she has much bigger issues.
