so glad i now know i have bpd as well as bp. things make much more sense now and has filled in the gaps that made me think i was just plain crazy.i can work at helping myself now i am such a mess but must pull things together i have 2 small children and single so i constantly fear my kids being taken away as i do struggle to get thru the days unfortunately the people who could help,dont their dad and family have known for years i am ill but have chosen to sit back and wait [and push me to it] for me to snap and they can swoop in to take the kids. what bastards my marriage and a stable family for my kids to grow up in could have been saved with help but people are so selfish. if they found out about the bpd i dont think id stand a chance the kids would be gone before i knew it and it wouldnt take long for me to be gone dead as the kids are the only things i make an effort for i would much prefer not to be here and dont know how i ever had kids- a manic choice prob. and because ive always been up and down i think my bonding with them has been affected and look at them and cant fit them with the babies i had its like they are diff. people as i have changed so much. worst thing is i think im being selfish keeping them would they really be better off without me and would they ever recover from knowing how messed up their mum was and that she took her own life just to end the pain and that all the adults round them knew and could have helped but didnt, in bad suicidal thought times i plan to the last detail how to pack up my life and home and drop the kids off at their dads and go find a way to do it,but on the other side im so terrified of my illnesses as i know i could end up dead as if this brain cancer will just get the better of me one day and i'll give up the fight.does any one else have kids and struggle to the point of exhaustion each day just to get thru? yet still feel like the worlds biggest failure.
