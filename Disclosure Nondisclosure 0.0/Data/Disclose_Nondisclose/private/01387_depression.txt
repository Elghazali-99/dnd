I have never posted to this before. But I am very concerned and seeking some insight.  Lately, I have been eating super healthy and all organic. I have been staying away from sugar, and I have been losing weight. However, tonight I ate cereal for dinner (so unhealthy, I know). After, I ate it I felt really weird and I ended up falling asleep. 2 hours later I woke up, and I couldn't see a thing! I felt like I was blind. I have never experienced such a thing. It really started to scare me and I started to cry. Giving myself an anxiety attack. Luckily, my aunt was around and help relax me. She gave me some okra infused water, to help lower my blood pressure.(Because my aunt thinks I could possibly be a diabetic)Finally, when I stopped crying and drank the water; I could see better, but it was all blurry. As if I had glasses on. I drank another cup of the water, and my version was back. I know this sounds very absurd; but, I am very scared and clearly, this isn't normal!  Is this a sign of being diabetic or just a random occurrence?
