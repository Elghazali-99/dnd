About Three years ago I started to date a man, he was wonderful and loving and caring, he told me his name was **** and that he was a age of 25, single. We hung out everyday, day and at night. maybe one or two days of the week we didn't but that was rare.  I had no thoughts of anything if he was married or if he was lying to me. He doesn't wear a ring till this day because he hates jewelry. A year later he confronts me that hes married, and he is 34 in real life. He said he lied and gave me reasons. I wasn't mad, for some reason it didnt bother me. At all. I am still with him till this day, and I still see him everyday(almost).  I do not want to cause a divorce or anyone to know im with him.  I want his family to stay together. My problem is I love secrets, like a true scorpio does. but I know once a cheater is always a cheater, if he cheats on his wife, he will cheat on me. I get very jealous but I try not to show it. He tells me he loves me, and misses me everyday. He still goes out and goes to parties, its a russian thing. 
 I was told so many time to leave him, I asked for advise from many people, it came same. But I cant leave him. I know it will hurt me in a long run, if he leaves me. I know it will lead to that. or we will just be friends because I do want to get married myself. Sheesh, I have a f******* problem. I cant help it. It hurts me now. A lot, maybe thats why im writing this here now. Why cant marry guys be faithful, why do the want more. They marry a women they love, but sometimes I guess they marry wrong. 
 I am 18 now and we where together since I was 16 but I lied to him to, but he knew it. 
 Please can someone give me advise!
