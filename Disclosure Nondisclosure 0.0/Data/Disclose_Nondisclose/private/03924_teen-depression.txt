I am 16. I was exposed to porn at a really young age 11-13 I the first time I watched porn it was lesbian porn and then I wondered what it would be like if a guy was in it but instead of straight porn I watched gay porn. I feel like I went threw this before when I was 13 I talked to a therapist about how I watched gay porn and it made me depressed but after I talked to him I felt better and went on with my life with out the anxiety or stress. When I was 14 I didn't have a way to watch porn so I had to go off of what I saw in real life and I was more drawn to girls I had a couple girlfriends and basically kissing and holding hands gave me a boner and me and this one girl messed around on the bus basically making out and rubbing each other I liked it honestly I went over to her house when her parents weren't there and we attempted sex but it hurt her to bad so we had to stop I had another girlfriend it only lasted like two weeks but I fingered her and we had phone sex but I never came but I had an erection every time we messed around. Then I never did anything with her other than make out and I got hard. Basically I had no question in my mind that I was straight an I liked girls but on occasion I would watch gay porn but most of the time I would have came before the video even came on I didn't see anything no visual aid or anything just like 5 second masturbation and I wasn't honestly think of guys or anything I just got off when I have watched gay porn and gotten off actually watching it I felt discusted and felt like "this isn't what I want". When I was 15 I didn't really have any desire to watch gay porn I didn't have any urge or want to watch gay porn I watched lesbain porn and messed around with girls I had this one girlfriend who i  never had sex with but she would always tease me (putting hand down my pants) she attempted a ******** on me and she had a chipped tooth and it cut me and it hurt really bad we broke up soon after that but I had made out with a few girls here and there always getting a boner and sometimes I would go on Facebook and look at a picture of a girl I liked and masturbate to the thought of her giving me oral (creepy i know). Now I have girlfriend I've been with her for 6 months I swear I'm in love we have done some stupid things her jerking me off in movie theater or giving me a ** in the move theater I remember basically one time she kissed me good bye and I wasn't a huge make out it was a peck and I had a full on boner when I got on the bus. One time after school we were making out under the stairs dry humping and kissing and neck kissing and I couldn't take it anymore and had her jerk me off (stupid I know) then one time she gave me a ** by th e bowling alley and it took me literally 30 seconds to come. Then we hung out this whole week one time she was on her period though and we really wanted to have sex but instead we kissed and dry humped and a couple of time when we were dry humping I came in my pants sometimes she would blow me or jerk me off 3 times in the same day the slightest things she does to me turn me on. Then she got off her period and so we went on this back road by a corn field and I asked her if she wanted to do it and we then we did it and I only lasted 15 seconds if that. But my friend saw that I was watching gay porn on my tablet the history was a month old and I didn't remember watching it (I came before the video even started) so basically I got scared and I told him that I didn't know if and said I was big even though I didn't feel bi I felt straight I still feel straight but I told him things like "idk if when I get older I might try it" I didn't really mean what Iwas saying i don't know so I was stressing out a lot so I told my girlfriend like "I confused idk if I'm bi or not" so I felt like I needed to figure it out so I started talking to this gay guy and I thought OK I'll experiment and find out if I'm gay but I backed out beaches I didn't want to do it. So basically I fear that I'm gay I read and read and try to find people that have masturbated to gay porn but are straight I obssess and anylize all my sexual experiences. I test myself by looking at gay porn and seeing what happens. Like I'll watch it clear my anxiety and fear and I'll tell myself it ok if I like it and everything I don't try to turn myself off I just watch and see what happens I stay soft I do this like +10 times a day I told my aunt and she said "maybe you are straight with a thing for gay porn" I just feel that its impossible but I don't want to be gay I don't feel gay I can't stop think about it I don't feel comfortable in my own skin I don't even have homosexual thoughts or anything its that I have before that makes me feel like I am gay I can't stop thinking about it I don't do anything but sit in my room and try to figure it out and I can't find anything nothing zip just makes me feel distressed makes me feel like I have to end my relationship with my girlfriend because I'm gay idk I just want to know mysexuality I can't stop think about it am I straight or am I in denial?
