I hope someone can help me. I am trying to withdraw from Effexor after 8 long years. I attempted it a year ago, but couldn't stick with it due to the awful side effects. So I started back on  and ended up taking it in a very unusual way- one 150 mg capsule, EVERY OTHER DAY. My body seemed to accept this every other day thing for the most part except for what I describe below, so I continued. Now I want to get off of it once and for all and my strange method of taking it has me worried.
 On my day to take the pill, I start to suffer the onset of withdrawal symptoms. This has gone on for many many months. Usually starts early AM, so I quick eat some food, and take the pill. Within 4-5 hours, I start to feel worse than I did before taking it. Lightheadedness, near dizziness, icky general feeling. On the off day, I feel fine.
 Two weeks ago, I started to open the capsules up (on my day of taking it) and remove some of the little dots of medicine. I knew I had to be very gradual, so I took only about 6 or 8% - very minor. I've maintained this regimine for two weeks.
 The reduction in the amount has not changed the feeling I described above. I didn't really expect it at this point but before I do any more reducing I'm now wondering if:  the onset of withdrawal symptoms that I feel is caused by 1) my body reacting to not taking it every day and my system is still on the decline for several hours after I do take it, OR   2) suddenly taking it after not taking it every day. 
 I hope its clear what I'm trying to convey here- I just got to thinking that this time-released capsule thing is maybe going to make this even more difficult than normal.  If there is anyone with knowledge of how the time release works could help me, I would appreciate it so much. I am so tired of being a prisoner to Effexor.
