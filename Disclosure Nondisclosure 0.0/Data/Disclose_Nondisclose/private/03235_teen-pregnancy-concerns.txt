I have never had sex before but I have masterbated a few times but I'm in a house of all girls so there is no risk of sperm getting in me...I am still worried. I am 15 and started my period when I was 13 around April.  I usually have my period at around the 25th each month but it's never exact it's just around that week I expect to get it. Well, today is the 8th and I still haven't gotten it. I have not had any pregnancy symptoms except for slightly sore breasts but I believe that is normal. Every day now I have been looking up people questioning about their problems whom are in the same situation as me but they don't always get the specific answer I want. I've talked to one of my friends about it and she said she had missed periods too, but I am still so worried! People say on some of the questions that when you have sore breasts and you missed your period it's highly likely you're pregnant.. is that true? I just have so much questions to ask!:( So scared especially how it's almost Christmas! -Great time to have this problem eh? Is there a way for me to find out if I am or not without using a pregnancy test? Please reply! Thanks!
