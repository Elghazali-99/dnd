Basal cell nevus Syndrome, my genetic disease I've dealt with since I was little. As bad as all this sounds eventually when my 30s to 40s hit, it will turn into Basal cell carcinoma. For all who don't know that's a form of cancer. So yea it's very scary, what's even more scary is no doctors really know about this disease. I'm afraid to get older, because I will have to see a dermatologist constantly to check for skin cancers. Insurances don't consider this a serious medical condition. So I have no insurance that can help with the major cost of surgeries. I go through excruciating pain almost daily. The worst part is there is no cure. I can have surgery, but the cyst will always come back, the skin cancers will always come back. The reason for this post is just to try to make a difference and let it be known that this disease is out there. It's so dangerous and so scary. Knowing my children may have it kills me. People don't know about it, so they don't see the symptoms with themselves. Spread the awareness
