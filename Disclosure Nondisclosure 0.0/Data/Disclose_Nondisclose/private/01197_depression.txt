I have been fighting what my primary GP says is depression for a few months now.  Also anxiety.  I have actually had an issue with this for most of my life (As any of you who read my previous posts know)  Right this very moment I feel super detached and tired and can't focus.  Mornings are an absolute horror.  The only time of day I have been able to eat anything has been in the evening after work.  It's incredibly hard to get out of bed in the morning and I feel so beaten down right now.  I'm currently on Citalopram 30MG, I have taken this religiously for a little over two years.  The doctor also prescribed me Xanax .25MG to take when needed, and lately that has been everyday, sometimes I would take two pills to help drown out the detached feeling and maybe eat some food.
 I'm so tired of fighting this.  I have a Wife and Daughter that I love dearly and keep pushing through for them.  I want to enjoy life tho, I want to be able To eat and I want to be able to enjoy the things I use to enjoy.  The only time I get joy right now is when I leave work and go lay down on my couch in the evening when my wife and daughter are around to talk to.  
 I am concerned bc it is effecting my job
Performance.  I have a very stressful job in sales an I need to be focused and motivate which I am not.  I have my first ever appointment with a psychiatrist in a few days and hope to get some answers.  A few months ago when all of this started back upy GP took a variety of blood work (CBC, testosterone and thyroid level). All good but for extremely low t and I'm taking androgel for that.
 I just feel like I'm never gonna get better and will lose everything I love
