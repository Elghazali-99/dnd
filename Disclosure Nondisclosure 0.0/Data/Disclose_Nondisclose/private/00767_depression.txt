I dont know how to stop being depressed and it is getting to a bad level. I do have a job and i try to function at it...but every one can tell im losing it. I try and get out of the house, and do things...but i never feel good about myself and i cry. My first true love dumped me after 3 years because he wasn't ready to settle down or have a girlfriend and wanted to party and do drugs and get wasted... a month later started dating a good friend i introduced him to a few months prior who lived at my house with her 2 kids. I thought they were crushing on each other so i asked my friend not to come over to his house on the weekend and 2 weeks later he dumped me in South Lake Tahoe on our vacation, and a month after the break up started dating that friend...she also likes drugs (heroin and meth) and drinking...and i dont...now it has been 2 months since he broke up with me and a month of they "dating" and im driving myself crazy. I was cutting after he broke up with me then stopped...but when i found out they were "dating" my cutting came back, worse then ever. Ive been to the doctor and they dont care...and i cant afford to try and see them anymore...i have never been so betrayed and i cant cope with it. I pray each night that i never wake up and each day when i get into my car i pray someone hits me head on just to end it for me. I've neveer been so low in my life and i fear i cannot make it anymore..
