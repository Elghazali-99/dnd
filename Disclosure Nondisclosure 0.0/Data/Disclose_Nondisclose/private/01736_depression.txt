Last summer, I read a poem about a boy who grew up. Right at the end of the poem, he kills himself and for some reason, this really affected me. I started to have these visions of a boy cutting himself until he would die, there would be blood everywhere and his mum could come in to find him, and she'd start screaming. None of this is real but when the visions occurred, it would seem like this was happening in front of me, and I wouldn't be able to stop thinking about it. I would cry and scream and it wouldn't stop. It got to the point where I would think about it in school and I had to be taken out of one of my lessons because I was crying so hard. Thankfully, after some time and after my therapist's help, these visions stopped and I forgot about the imaginary boy. However, yesterday, nearly a year after the visions stopped, I read the poem again and it happened again. This time was worse, I broke down and actually cut myself in the process. I'm not sure whether this was because I couldn't stop the vision, but as I could see him cutting himself, I did it to myself too and now I have scars on my wrists. I am so scared and I don't know what to do. I am 15 years old and need advice.
