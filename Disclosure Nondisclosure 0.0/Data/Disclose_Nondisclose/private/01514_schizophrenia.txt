Is it possible for a medical drug to be clogged up in blood vessels, tissues or fluids in the brain and later break away and redose you. I had been taking rispetidon for 3 months late in 2014 without any major side effects like acute dystonia. Then decided to stop it 3 months later.Early last year in march, i was given 2 risperidon injections which gave me acute dystonia, and decided to stop taking the medication alltogether. Then june came, wen it was very cold here, i started feeling the same side effects of risperidon for a week or so before they stopped. From there i stayed six months without any side effects or withdrawal. Now in mid december 2016, wen its rainy and cold here and after doing some heavy dancing involving a lot of movement of my head, i have been having the side effects of risperidon ever since without stop and my toungue is rigid, sedation, high appetite, sweating, feeling cold, dystinia episodes which is painfull. Why am i feeling like this? I havent taken any medication or any drug after my last injection and i am not addicted to drugs. Ps: i have a habit of blocking my ears with my hands by putting pressure on my earlids to close my ears due to noise in my area and i also usually sleep eyes facing the roof and head down. Please help
