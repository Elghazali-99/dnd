Hi! Good day!
I just want an answer in my situation. So we can have a piece of mind.
She gave me a **, then I ejaculated and she swallowed it all, after that, we were still turned on, so I again masturbated in front of her but never touched the head of my genital (And I didn't notice any semen or any whitish substance on my hands), but I feel a bit moist, maybe because of her saliva (not sure). Then I use a condom and applied drops of water-based lubricant, then I spread it around my genital with the condom on, but I later changed my mind so we didn't continue in having sex, but I fingered her once, with one finger and just a quick in-and-out. And now, it has been 3 days since, and she has been experiencing nausea, abdominal bloating, having vaginal secretions, pain in the pelvic area, and we learned that she was approximately ovulation on the day we did that. 
We are both paranoid and we have a board examination coming this June and we are so stressed and I don't want her to be distracted and disturbed while she is studying. 
And my questions are, is there a possibility that I have pre-ejaculation in my hands even though I never touched the head of my genital? Are there any possibility of pregnancy in this situation? Does the water-based lubricant kill sperm? Should we be worried?
I hope for an immediate reply. Thank you.
