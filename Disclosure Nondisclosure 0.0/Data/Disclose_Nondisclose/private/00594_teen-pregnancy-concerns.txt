Is anyone can help me.  I'm so stressed about it . I don't know if I'm pregnant or it just all in my head.  I missed my period this month . My last period is on Oct 22 and as I thought it should come on 26 of  November but it never came.  Is it because of my new schedule because my new schedule is so stressful I almost forgot to eat and I don't eat at the right time and I don't get enough sleep because I have many things to accomplish at night . Or I'm pregnant ? I heard that you can be pregnant through precum . Me and my bf had little naughty his thing touches mine but it never enters me . The day after that I'm so very afraid because of what I've read about being pregnant to precum . Then I started to feel wierd . I think I feel the symptoms of pregnancy but its just 2 days after what happened but when I stop thinking and worrying I feel normal again . These past few days I feel normal but when I think about missing my period and the possibility that I can be pregnant I started to feel nervous, scared , and worried I also feel butterflies in my tummy same feeling when we get nervous I also have head ache and stiff neck . Someone please help me.
