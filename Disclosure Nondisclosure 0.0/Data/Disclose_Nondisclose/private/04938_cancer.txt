Can a mammogram technician give you too much radiation?  I went for my annual mammogram a few months ago and the tech.  used the sanitary wipes to clean the machine and advised me to take my final picture. She pressed harder and held the scan a lot longer than the others.  When I left there my breast were in so much pain.  A burning sensation. Originally I thought the pain and burning was normal, because it is never a pleasant experience for me, but as it continued to burn I stopped in the bathroom and washed my breast off, thinking that there may have been some residual from her using the wipes to clean the machine.  Later I felt nauseous and my heart started racing and the pain persist. I made an appointment with my doctor they took several blood test and gave me an EKG and a breast exam and assured me it was fine.  Several months later I started having pain under my breast and across my chest.  I believe I had too much radiation exposure.  How should I proceed.  I want to go back and get another mammogram, but I fear I'm only exposing myself to more radiation.  Please advise.
