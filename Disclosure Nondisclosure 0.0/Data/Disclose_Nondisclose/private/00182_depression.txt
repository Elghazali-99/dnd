So let me fill you in, I am a 18 year old male student doing my 5th year in highschool. I never made enough credits my freshmen through senior year because of learning disabilities revolved around anxiety and depression. I often missed school due to being hospitalized and day treatment programs for my self harm and depression and anxiety. I am trying my best to work at getting my highschool certificate but my mental health has been getting in the way. I have been seeing a therapist for 5 years now and have been prescribed multiple medications to help me cope. I work at job that is a passion of mine working with animals. But I am confused with my life as far as what is next for me. I am overwhelmed with finishing highschool and then getting a post highschool education. And even being in the workforce is a lot for me to handle even doing something that I absolutely love. I have an amazing support system (family, long term girlfriend, friends) but I just can't seem to swallow the idea of post highschool education or going to work full time. I feel as if I am trapped.
