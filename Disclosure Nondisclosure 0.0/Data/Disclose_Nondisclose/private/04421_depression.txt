I went to doctor last week as I was feeling very tired and could be bothered getting up. I was alway sleepy. I suffer from low iron. I thought they may of been low again. Test came back fine. Dr then said maybe I was depressed and stressed a little. I did a kr or some thing written test and got a 21. He said that that is mild depression. And I should see a councilor. I work at a day spa with lots of hormonal girls that are always arguing and I'm cause in the middle of it. Also I feel like a councilor with clients as they tell me all there problems and life stories. When I get home I am tired and get cranky when in tired. I'm always snapping at my boyfriend for little things or just am moody and sad. I am always thinking about stuff before bed what I have to do tomorrow. What we need at shops. What I have to do at work. Random things. And will keep waking up during the night. Them wake up and feel tired. I feel bad for my boyfriend as we don't have sex much as I'm so tired. or I'll be cranky at him and just go to bed. I feeling like I take it out on him alot. I love him do much and we have just bought a house together so that is a big move for us in our new life. But I don't want to keep making him cranky from me being tired a d cranky all the time. My dr has has said to keep a diary. But what do I write in it. He said I don't need medication just some ways to deal with blocking out peoples problems from counciling.
