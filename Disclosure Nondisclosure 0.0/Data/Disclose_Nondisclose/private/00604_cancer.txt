Hello.
 Yesterday I noticed that my submental lymph node (midline under the chin at the anterior portion of the neck about 1cm in from the mandible) is somewhat enlarged.  I think it's about ~1cm and maybe a little larger, it's hard to gauge accurately through the skin.  It's palpable with light pressure.  It isn't soft nor does it feel like a rock beneath the skin.  It is definitely firm.  It's hard to tell if it's movable or not.  I am very worried this could be lymphoma.
 I do have a sore like a big pimple or boil on my upper left lip that has slowly been healing over the past 5 days or so.  About 3 days ago it was quite inflamed but that has gone down considerably.  My throat has also been slightly scratchy for a few days but no pain, coughing, or other symptoms.  For the past 4 nights or so I woke in the morning with a very dry mouth, but this has abated.  My throat is still a little scratchy, though.
 I have not had other symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, or itching.
 How long should I wait to go to the doctor for this node?  Could the (probably infected) sore on my UPPER lip cause this node to swell? How fast does lymphoma grow?  
 I have tried a warm compress to reduce the size of this node, however it seems to be the same size as it was last night.  I have checked but found no other enlarged nodes.
 I have a vacation coming up in 3 weeks and I do not want to have to worry about this while I'm trying to enjoy myself.
