I have BPD and Bipolar 2, add to it a case of Lyme's and a few other things and I am pretty much a mess. The physical stuff is pretty much out of my hands, but I know that BPD is something that at least can be managed if a person understands the root of their problems. As a 46 year old man I was taught early on to bury any emotions, so I rarely open up like I am going to now. I am convinced my problems with BPD come from the fact I have serious abandonment issues. When I was 6 my Dad took off and I didn't hear from him again for over 20 years. The step Dad who replaced him was close to me, and after 7 years he too took off, never to be heard from again. The only real attention any of us kids got growing up was generally negative attention. My entire Mother's side of the family has issues, because every single father ran out. My two half brothers both have different fathers, they ran off. My Mom's Dad ran off, as did my Grandmother's. I believe the entire family suffers from BPD, and my Grandmother had a nasty case of bipolar disorder. Thus, for those afflicted with this disease, do you have similar stories? All I know is I either love or hate, there is no in between. When I love, it's intense, and when I hate, it's intense. I have gotten in many fights in my lifetime for this reason. I am tired of psych drugs and only take anti depressants now. I am trying to figure out the source of this personality disorder. I have no doubt I have it since I have every single symptom and have been diagnosed by several psychologists. I have spent at least twelve visits to psych wards in the last ten years. I more or less lived with these problems, until I got bit by a tick and got Lymes, which has been untreated for 12 years. After that everything hit all at once, and I lost all my friends, most of my family and all of my zest for life. I frankly could care less if I died tomorrow, at least the pain would go away finally.
