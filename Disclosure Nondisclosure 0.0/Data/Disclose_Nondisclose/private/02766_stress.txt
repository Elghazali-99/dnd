my schedule is super crazy right now, I wake up @ 5AM and do school work, and get ready for school, 7:30 I am headed out the door for school. I go to school until 12. I grab something to eat and head home to change for work. Sometimes I may be able to sleep for an hour depending on the day. By 2 I have to leave for work being that I live an hour away from my job because of traffic, and I work until 11pm.  When I get off of work, its 12PM before I get home, most of the time I do homework for an hour of so. And this is my day. In the beginning, it didn't seem bad, and it didnt bother me. Now it does because I never have time for myself, my only off day is Sunday, which I am either doing homework or catching up on sleep. I have no time for friends, and I feel that I am losing the friends I do have, because they think I don't want to be with them anymore, which isnt true. My boyfriend, Mike, is getting tired of my busy schedule too, which I can't say that I blame him, which he thinks that I am cheating on him, which isnt true, when do I have time to cheat. And I tell him all the time that if I were spending my time with anyone, it would be him. I dont get time for laundry, cleaning or my birds anymore. I really don't know what to do....Quiting school isnt an option, and I have to work. The only thing I could do is stop seeing Mike which I really don't want to do, but I dont feel that it is fair to him. I am trying to sell my birds, but its hard to let them go. I really love them, but I know its not fair to them either. 
 Any one have any advice????
