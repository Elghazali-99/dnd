I currently have 7 kids and I am pregnant. I myself have 4 boys and take care of 3 children that are not mine. I am 10 weeks pregnant and the father just straight makes me angry. He uses Facebook to message ppl and lies to me about it. He also texts his ex girlfriends dad which he has no need to and he just constantly lies to me about everything. My youngest child is his and so is the one on the way. I am scared to leave him due to him being the one who is financially stable and I had to quit my job cuz he would not help me care for our son while I was at work and had no other sitter with the hours I worked. Its not so much that I am scared of being alone its how am I gonna take care of 8 kids on my own if I do leave him. There are so many cons to our relationship and I don't know what to do. I love him dearly but I truly want to leave him. We have been together 2 1/2 years and its the same things over and over. He texts girls and ppl I don't like just to make me angry and he gets on Facebook just to make me mad and he is so controlling its insane. I can't have friends I can't go anywhere or do anything and if I do he accuses me of cheating. I have never cheated on him and I am just sad and mad all the time. I don't know what to do anymore and I can't find any stability with my life and I just feel hopeless. I don't know if I can be a single parent but yet at the same time I feel like a single parent right now. I'm lost. Please help. Sorry bout the long story.
