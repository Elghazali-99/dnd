Hello--
 I am currently working in a preschool/day care in which one of the children in another class has shown increasingly difficult behaviors due to sexual abuse in the past. Most of the behaviors I have a decent understanding of (sexual re-enactment, aggressiveness, etc) but am puzzled by potty issues. She is currently 3 years old, and from my understanding, willingly goes to the bathroom in her pants. I have also worked with abused children in the past who appear to not want to (or are not able to) control their urination or bm's, so I know this is not a behavior that is unheard of. However, I can not seem to find any resources on the issue. From my own theories, I believe that these potty issues are connected with the child's desire for control over their body, whether it is to decide when and where they will go to the bathroom, or even as a defense mechanism. These however are my own interpretations and would like to know what others think, ideas on how to handle the issue (for example--should the child be allowed to wear a pull-up, should she be expected to go home after an accident, etc), and please, any information on where I can find related resources. 
 Thank you so much,
