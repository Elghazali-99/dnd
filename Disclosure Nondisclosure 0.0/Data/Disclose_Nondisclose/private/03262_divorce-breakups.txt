My soon to be ex husband and I are going through a divorce that has been going on for four months. We are currently trying to come to a marital/custody settlement, however do have a temporary court order with a custody evaluator ordered as well (should we not come to a settlement). I do have temporary sole physical custody and we have joint legal of our son. My ex has very little visitation with him but continues to ask for more. I understand the importance of this and will want them to have a bit more time if we settle; however, my ex continues to lie, manipulate, arrive at the home (which I stayed at) unannounced, play mind games with me, etc. I also have concerns about the way our son is taken care of when he is with my ex. Have any of you dealt with this before? He says he will not settle unless I start being more fair now with visitation. I continue to tell him I'm going by the court order and that's it. I believe he is just being manipulative as usual. Can anyone give me ideas of how to confront him as to the importance of the court order in a way he may understand? Nothing I have tried is working. Thanks!
