I'm wondering if I suffer from dysthymia.  I'm a 33 y.o. male.  Main symptoms are constant, heavy fatigue, poor concentration, some overeating, and lack of enjoyment/low motivation.  First sypmtoms were 10 years ago.  I've seen the g.p. on several occasions, but nothing seemed to work.  He thought it was depression.  We tried prozac for a few months, but that made me exceptionally sleepy.  Wellbutrin was tried for a year, maxing at 450mg per day.  I didn't feel much difference, although possibly a 'bump' during the first month or two when my appetite decreased and I could concentrate better.    I never have "up" periods.
 My bloodwork (CBCs) are fine.
 I've never felt suicidal, nor down on myself.  I don't have crying spells, and I'm not particularly sad.  I can be a little irritable when fatigued.  I do have frequent feelings of regret and remorse, such that I've had to train myself not to think that way.
 I work in a very stressful job where conflict is part of my responsibility.  I don't particularly love it, but I feel like I have a handle on it.  
 Just wondering if this fits the mold.  I'm just really, really tired of being tired.  Any help would be appreciated.
