I had absolutely no clue what 'topic' to put this under...  It would be nice if they had an 'all of the above' category
 I have so much going on mentally, physically, emotionally and otherwise that I just cannot find a way to relax at all.  My father just died a week ago.  I was his caretaker this past year.  My ex-boyfriend has been harrassing me since April of last year, not just harrassing, but stalking and there's not a damn thing I can do about it.  I just came to the realization Thursday that I'm an alcoholic.  My doctor thinks I have liver disease related to my six years of heavy drinking.  Since my Dad's passing last week I have pushed more people out of my life without really realizing till now,  and I feel so completely alone....  I can't even possibly list everything going on in my life right now,  nor could I list the details... but you get the point.
 If you had that many big life stressors hanging over you,  what would you do to relax?  Drinking is out of the question though,  because I'm wanting to quit as soon as I can talk to my doctor and tell him I need help with the physical part of my drinking.
 Sorry for ranting.  
 What would you do to relax?
