My brother is verbally abusing his own two boys.  He yells at the nine year old boy for every little infraction (coming in second even though not in a race, forgetting a spelling word though he's a straight A kid, etc.).  His abuse includes yelling for an hour, then blaming the boy for taking up too much of his time, and then keeping the boy up too late at night so he can redo his homework "right" (remember, he's already a straight A kid, so "right" means perfect in absolutely every little aspect).  The yelling accuses the boy of wasting the money that my brother and his wife spend on private school, telling the boy that he's useless ("you will never make it, will you?"), etc.  The younger boy, who's 7, sits in a small chair trying to stay out of the way.  He doesn't move or play - he's too scared.  I don't know what to say to my brother because he will become angrier and then I won't be able to visit my nephews and let them know they are loved.  My brother won't go to a therapist or a psychiatrist because he feels it will jeopardize his career.  What do I do and how do I get my brother to realize he's wrong and needs help?  And that his kids need help?
