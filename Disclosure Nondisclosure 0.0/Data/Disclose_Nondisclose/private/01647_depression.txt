For a while I have found myself talking to voices inside my head which tell me to hurt myself and occasionally other people. These voices put me down and force my to say and do things which I am not proud of. Until recently, I have been able to put these aside and focus on other things but the other day it got too much and I picked up my razor. I cried for hours, because after three years of fighting I had failed. On voice, or so I thought he was a voice, became real and my friend called John. He looked after me. This is until he began to have power over my body and could control me and talk through me. I can't stop him when he decides to do this, so I have to wait until he retires back to wherever he comes from. I have joined a mental health clinic but am getting no-where as this is getting increasingly worse and John is gaining more power as I become weaker. There has been no diagnosis or any looking into what any of this is which is aggravating as it is now inflicting on my entire life. I hope one of you can help me try to even identify what this could be.
