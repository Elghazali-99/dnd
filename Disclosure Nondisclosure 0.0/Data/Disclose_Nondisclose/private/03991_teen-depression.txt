Let me start off by saying that i am a highschool student, fairly popular, good social skills, etc. 
 but;
 Throughout the past year, i have been noticing unusual thought processes. i dont know exactly why or how it even started, but ill try to explain it:
 say im sitting in class, or at work, etc.  Ill start daydreaming, about something im doing, or going to do in the future. Anywhere from 2 mins, to 8 hours away. Right away ill analyze the situation and either dissociate it as "un-entertaining/boring/dreadful/etc," feeling or an "Awesome/cant-wait/exciting" feeling.
 Thats where the problem comes in. As soon as i start analyzing something, i will most likely comprehend it as "fun", but after re-analyzing it, it will turn into a dreadful feeling; thinkin',  "Damn, what even makes that fun? fuccck that isnt fun to do, i dont wanna do that."
 Right then, my stomach "drops." Sometimes to the point of actually feeling a physical effect that is almost unexplainable, and will persist as long as i think about it. This usually continues throughtout the day, 24/7, but isnt just 1 topic, its any random thought.
  im i going to have this same thought process for the rest of my life? any fixes? let me know
