I have been having numbness and tingling in my left arm and hand, sometimes my left leg and even tonight a little in my right arm.  I have a family history of stroke (mother died of stroke, and grandmother on her side too), but I also read that menopause can cause numbness.   I admitted myself to ER two weeks ago due to these symptoms (and some indigestion), and since then have had a stress test (which was borderline), and am set up to do a heart cath.  Last night it really freaked me out because I woke up feeling numb in all three places.  I don't want to ingnore this, but if it is related to menopause, what tests should I have done to rule that out?  I know I should probably have  something done to check for stroke, but my family doctor just sent me to the cardiologist.  Weird thing is, I don't have high blood pressure or high cholesterol, but I do have heart issues in the family line (dad has had a quadruple and double bypass). I am in the early stages of menopause (I've only had about 4 periods this year, and lots of hot flashes this fall and spring).  I'm 49.  Any help you can give would be appreciated!
