Hello,
 My brother, 36 yrs old, tried "bath salts" a couple of times a year or two ago (a couple of times that he admitted to me trying), and now he has lost his good paying career and his family (wife and two kids) as of 2 months ago, and has no home or job since then. 
 He's been showing signs of paranoia, emotional depression, and aggression towards all of our family members and close friends of his. He shows no motivation to do anything but sleep and stay on his computer late at night. He's expressed that he believes someone is out to "get him", and is constantly changing his email addresses and phones over the last year. He's staying with my parents, and has no car or money to afford to go anywhere or do anything else. We all have been cursed out by him and blamed for ruining his life multiple times over the last two months. He was temporarily committed to a hospital for showing signs of suicidal thoughts, and even saying, "things would just be better if I wasn't around, and why not put a bullet in my mouth." The hospital psychiatrist released him after evaluating my brother, due to confirming that he was not a danger to himself or others -- that was a month ago. 
 He has never acted or said things like this before to any of us, and he's not willing to go to a mental health professional to try and seek help on his own. My parents are doing what they can, but I don't believe that they are willing to consider this behavior is a result of his use of bath salts. 
 I'm very concerned for my parents safety while my brother is staying with them.
 2 Questions:
1- What legally can we do if he's not willing to go to see a Dr on his own to seek help?
2- What type of Dr should he go see to get the help he may need?
3- Does anyone have other suggestions of what else to look for an/or try to get him to go see the appropriate Dr?
 Thank you so much,
 BrotherLP
