I've been going insane the past two/three weeks. 
I finished my last period on August 15 and a couple days after that I was fooling around with my boyfriend. Every time we do stuff, we try to be as careful as we can. Pants are always kept on etc. I gave him a handjob and I honestly can't remember if he ejaculated or not but I feel like he didn't. He had to leave right after and I forgot to wipe my hand or wash them. Usually I'm so so careful. I think about 10 minutes later, I had scratched my vagina and then I remembered that I hadn't washed my hands. I know it sounds silly to think pregnancy is possible from this but I need guidance. I'm only 17 years old and a pregnancy would ruin my life, my boyfriend's life, and both our reputations. My dream is to go to med school and I don't plan on having kids until I've reached a calm point in my career. My period is now a week late. It was supposed to come on September 13. I'm so scared. The idea of being pregnant makes me sick to my stomach. Like right now, I want to throw up and I honestly can't decide if it's a pregnancy symptom or what. I basically never want to do anything sexual again because I can't handle this type of stress. I've looked on a lot of sites to see if a pregnancy is possible from this but I just need some reassurance/advice. Thank you so much in advance.
