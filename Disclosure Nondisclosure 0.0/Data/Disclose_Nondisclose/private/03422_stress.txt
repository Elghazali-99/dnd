My boyfriend is 28 years old and two years back he started having heart palpitation. He used to feel that something is moving behind he's eyes and his heart is beating irregularly. Doctors just mentioned he has a slight disfunction of heart valves and that no specific treatment is available for it. We are having very stressful life for last 2 months and last 1 week has been particularly very stressful due to personal reasons. He hasn't been able to sleep properly and stays very stressed. Today while coming back home he felt dizzy and said he felt brown spots infront of his both eyes and couldn't see things clearly thou he didn't loose complete conciousness. After resting at home he felt better but again he had the same feeling of spots infront of both eyes and the feeling passed away again in sometime. I am very tensed with this instance. Please advice what could be the reason of this happening and also please advise which specialist should we refer too or if any test need to be taken. Please reply at the earliest. Thank You.
