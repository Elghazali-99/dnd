I'm a 14 year old girl and I'm going into my first year of high school in September. Ending middle school I started noticing I cared less and less about almost everything I did. I stopped piano lessons and became reluctant to go to my archery classes and tournaments. I used to write a lot, but suddenly I couldn't be creative at all.
 At the end of school and throughout this summer I became addicted to video games, I'd stay up until 4 or 5AM and sleep until noon or later. Then I'd spend the whole day playing games until late and repete. All the time I have this dark cloud over everything I say and do. Even when one of my best friends came over and made me laugh really hard, I still felt... Empty... And dark.
 I DON'T want to be like this, I want to be productive, but I just can't bring myself to do anything anymore... I just don't care. I was supposed to be reading these four books and doing reports on them and I can't even do that! I LOVE reading... This was when I realized there was something really wrong. I sit at my computer and stress about not getting the book reports done and I think of how I'm going to make an excuse or... Something, I don't know what to do. I go to bed freaking out about how I'm not going to get it done and I start crying, normally. I don't want to disappoint the teachers or my parents, because that'd be letting down myself. I told my mom and she says it's just a teen thing, but I think something is really up.
 I feel awful and pressed all the time, but I try to ignore it... Something needs to change, but I don't care enough to change it... It doesn't help that my mother does nothing too even though she knows about it, she just gave me a hug and told me not to worry.
 I'm scared I'm going to fail high school. I am scared I'm going to disappoint my family and my teachers and I really REALLY don't want to. I want to go back, I want to feel like I used to... I was happy... I was okay...
Any and all help is greatly appreciated.
