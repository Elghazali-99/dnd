My friend is a victim of domestic violence from her husband.
 She didn't press charges on her husband because she was more concern about her marriage. She wanted to work it out. I guess she forgived him and offered a chance. Her husband is charged for domestic violence from the state. It's most likely that her husband's case will be closed because she didn't mention (confessed) any of his abuse.
 Her husband is taking domestic violence classes because the army is required for him to do so. From what I was told from my classmate (he's a retired soldier), the army would do whatever they can to save soldiers from getting in trouble.
 In addition, he's trying to save his job!  Although he's taking domestic violence classes, he's still abusing her. My friend wanted help from the court, but she's also afraid that it would cost her marriage.
 Recently, her husband find out that she has evidence of the abuse. Her husband is trying to take the evidence away from her. Will there be another case on her husband for domestic violence because of the evidence??
 I understand that she wants to save her marriage by working things out. Is that the right thing to do??????
