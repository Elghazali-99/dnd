I'm interested to know whether people diagnosed with BPD who contribute to this forum do paid work.
 Ever since I left school I've had big problems holding down a job, mostly because relationships with my colleagues tend to go awry...  I seem to be okay at getting jobs, but I can't seem to hang on to them.  Most of the jobs I've had I've left by spitting the dummy and walking out, without having another job to go to.  I have to live on the dole for a little while, then I get another job and the cycle repeats.  Honestly, I've probably had about 40 different jobs since I left school.  Sometimes it's hard to hope that I'll ever get over this problem.  I don't think my family understand - to them I seem well, and they think that because it's me choosing to leave rather than getting the sack, I could simply make the decision to stay and it would all be okay.  I think they think I'm just lazy or something.
 It'd be great to hear about other people's experiences and whether maintaining positive relationships at work has gotten any easier over time.
 Thanks.
