Hi, I'm 16 years old and I'm not really an unhappy person and I'm not depressed all the time like some people but I do have a question. You see, whenever I watch a movie that I saw when I was really little or anything I get depressed, I don't know why. My little brother watches pokemon and although I couldn't care less about it now, just a month or two ago I sat down with him and watched an episode and that made me depressed as well. Whenever a movie does that to me I feel miserable for usually the next couple weeks, and in that time the only thing that makes me happy is to watch the same movie over and over and over again. Even if it's not particularly good. Yesterday I saw the movie "Anastasia", which I haven't seen probably since a year or two after it came out. The movie isn't all that good but it still depressed me enough that in order to stop feeling that way I have to watch it over and over again. Really it's the song at the end of "Anastasia" that depresses me for some reason.
   Anyway I'm not normally an unhappy person... My parents have split up and I'm not very social with people but that's just the way I am. I have had no deaths or anything really close to me in my family so I don't know why I get the way I do. I know that I have a good life and I'm actually lucky. I have a place to live and I never go hungry so why is it that movies from my past make me feel the way I do?
