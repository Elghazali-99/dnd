4 years ago I discovered I had a brain tumor. It's not growing but I was advised to get contraception as it was not a suitable time to get pregnant. I tried the implant and had a reaction to it so it was removed. I then opted for the IUD. Over the last couple of years I have developed some symptoms that my mother has said relate to going through menopause. I am having hot flashes, mood swings, depression, I have gained weight and I haven't had a period in over 2 years. My breasts are also very sensitive and are growing at an alarming rate. They have grown from a 30G to 32K in 3 years causing me to have back pain and I have problems sitting up straight. All of this is disturbing as I am now only 26 and this should not be happening for another 20 years. I can't have a normal social life as I can't even join a gym or go swimming because of my breast size, work because of my brain tumor and feel good about myself in general. My boyfriend calls me beautiful but I don't see it. I feel disgusting. If anyone knows anything about the effects of having the IUD, it wud be much appreciated if you could let me know. Thanks.
