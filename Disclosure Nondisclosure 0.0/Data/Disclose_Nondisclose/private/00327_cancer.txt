For 5 years ive been constantly feeling my body for lumps and seem to be always finding new ones. As of now, I can feel 7 in my groin, 2 in each armpit, 2 on the back of my neck (aligning my spine), 2 of either side of my jaw (sort of where your ear connects to your face adjacent to your ear lobe) and 2 on the back of my skull (behind my ear). They're all moveable, painless, sort of rubbery and around 1-2cm and have remained the same size for the whole time. I used to have pain in my groin when I walked but that only lasted a few months (years ago) so I'm extremely scared of cancer, im a 16 year old male. 
 I also always seem to be finding new problems with my body and feel all sorts of aches and pains which make me worry. I'm always tired too (although I dont have the best sleep schedule). Around the time I discovered all these lumps I found this lumpy mass in my scrotum which I can only feel when I stand up which I believe to be a varicocele. So I'm extremely scared that all these symptoms are linked and I constantly find myself searching through the internet and fearing the worst, cancer! Please help.
