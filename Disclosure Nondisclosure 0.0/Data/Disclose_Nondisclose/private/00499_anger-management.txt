Since my relationship with my partner has gone on I seem to get angrier and angrier with him, I cant stop it, I try and just stay calm or even ignore him to stop going off but to no avail.  It can be just something simple or to me something extreme for example ask him to go shopping with only a short list of items and he will somehow forget one of them this sets me off, or the mess he can make like just throwing orange peels on the floor and say oh will clean that up later, how hard is it to put things in the rubbish for goodness sake, or we just got KFC takeaway and he has eaten the chicken while driving and throws the bones in the back to the dog farrrr out!!! But wait there is more its never ending most people start there day even if they don't have much to do,  (unless you are sick/unwell) by having a shower, brushing ones teeth and most of the time having breakfast but no not this guy, What the!!! To me I have reasons to suggest he doesn't do those things, or do somethings like put rubbish in the bin, but he thinks I am going on about nothing, Can anyone suggest what I may be able to say to make him change his ways.
Thanks
