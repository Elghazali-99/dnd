I am looking for answers. NOT pitty. NOT symphaty.  My mother is a *****!!!! She emotionally abuses everyone around her. She has no respect for man! She is very, very critical. She has this way of getting me all "wired up" so that within a couples of days we end up fighting and breaking away from eachother for years. I am the one who usually keep on going back to make ammends, but inspite of my good intentions, she turns it all against me, and goes on on hurting me over and over again. To be fair, she did literaly saved my life once, and afford me an opportunity or two that I would not have had otherwise. But she doesnot pass on the opportunity to throw it back on my face. I thinks she has alot guilt too about how bad of a mother she has been.  My father is a looser. He never stands up to a women, and "submitts" to whatever circumstances they get him into it.  He ALWAYS calls me a liar, and doesn't believe anything I say. Behind my back people tell me that he is proud of me and only say good things about me. But when we are together, I always feel pressed to impress him. I don't care about understanding how to deal with them, or why they behave this way towards me!   WHAT I WANT TO KNOW, IS HOW DO A "CURE" this feeling I have of falling short of being normal. My lack of confiedence is always present, and I often "sabotage" whatever good things are going in my favor. I always find an excuse to come through on whatever project I attempt. I am a compulsive liar, although I am not sure if they are really lies because it all seem so real to me.
