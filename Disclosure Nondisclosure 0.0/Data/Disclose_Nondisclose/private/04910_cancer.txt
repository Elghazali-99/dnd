I had what I thought were blackhead pimples on my back and had been popping them blindly with tweezers until my fianc√© caught me and freaked out. He says there are no pimples, only freckles. However, when I squeeze or even just rub my back, I can feel and see white or tan things coming out of my skin. After my bath today when there was a lot of them coming out just prior, I noticed a bunch of what looked like pieces of skin floating in the water. Also, the freckles on my shoulders have recently been becoming irritated, and they start to hurt and look like a pimple, with white head and all, they actually feel like there is a piece of sand or a little rock under the skin, yet when I squeeze I cant see much coming out. Today I squeezed and could see a whitish looking piece attached to the dark center of the pimple or freckle or whatever, but got scared and stopped. In addition, for the past year or so, I have been getting acne or something on my face, which I have never had and I am 42. However when I try to squeeze these areas, only liquid usually comes out and it ends up macerating the skin around the main blemish, making it 2-3 times the size when it scabs over. Than these scabs take a month or so to heal. I am scared to go to the doctor.
