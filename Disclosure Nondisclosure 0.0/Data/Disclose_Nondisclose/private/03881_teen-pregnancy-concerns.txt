hi i was just wondering if anyone could offer me some help or advice on whether they think im pregnant or not...
 im 15 years old (16 in the end of august) and have used various forms of contraception including the depo-provera injection, the implant and the pill from the age of around 13... i had my implant removed about a year ago and had the depo-provera injection for about 9 months and has my last one in the 2nd week of august. i started the pill and have been on it since that time but stopped taking it on the 21st of december and since then had a weeks period. me and my boyfrind have sex every 2/3 days and we dont use contraception and he always ejaculates inside me...
 i am wondering if i could be pregnant as i have been a lot more tired than usual and have been having pains in my stomach which arent bad enough to cause me severe pain but do hurt and feel abnormal. i have been having more headaches than usual. my appatite has changed a lot as i have been not hungry at all at times and then next i am soo hungry which is not norally like me... i have been getting lightheadedness also and the past few mornings i have been feeling really sick. my breasts arent sore and im not sure if my nipples have darkened but i dont think so
 also the past 2 times i had sex i bled afterwards but haven't had a proper period so dont know if i have missed one or not...
 i dont want to be judged or to be given nasty comments about my choices so i would appreciate opinions of those who think they may know if i am pregnent or not.
 thank you!
