My father was a very abusive man, beat on my mom, my brother and my sisters..He was always drunk or high..He would always sneak in my room and touch me and say im gonna tell your mom if u peed to bed...He would make me let him check me....He would make me lay on the bed and then get on top of me thank god my sisters came in..He would alway make me take a bath and he would be the one who had to wash me. I tried to forget about it pretend it didnt happen so i wouldnt be in trouble with my mom..For years i have kept it to myself afraid everyone would hate me and, i finally told my brother and sister thinking i would have more support  but that has never happened...My dad got married and him and his wife have nothing to do with any of his kids and pretty much harassas all of us...I feel i am not good enough for anything or anyone, i lost alot of weight but i get depressed so bad and it seems food is all i have..i dont know what to do with myself anymore..I am always angry and depressed and feeling alone..i need some help please...
