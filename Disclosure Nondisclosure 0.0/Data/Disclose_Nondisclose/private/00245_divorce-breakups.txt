Was with my soon to be ex for 10 years. Was happy at first but the last few years, I was starting to feel unhappy. He knew it and I told him. We have a child together and she has been handling things better than expected. My problem comes in with the ex though. Though I left and yes, found a new person in my life, he has called me many names in the book as well as an adultress, I am stressed after dealing with him. I cry a lot and he...just won't be nice. I am not going to stoop down to his level. Not going to talk bad about him or anything. That is not me. He has however, been asking and getting information about the new person I am with and trying to use that against me. He has threatened me with our daughter and when she is happy he will pull her aside and next thing I know she is crying. He has post bad things about me...sure I probably deserve it but he should not bring our child into it and attempt to turn her against me. Things went down hill when he slapped me on my birthday in 2006. Ever since then I no longer was able to trust him. He has always yelled at me and though I worked two jobs and he on disability, I still had to clean house at 1 or 2 am after I get home from work, take our child to the doctor (which I am not complaining about but he should go with us) and so forth. He has used porn in place of me which tore me up over the years. I know I am not the drop dead beautiy bomb shell he wants but he did propose to me. Of which at that time, he was married. But what really is bothering me the most is though I am doing all i can, I still supply him money and food when he has our daughter, he still threatens me by saying he going to fill for full custody, yells and screams at me over the phone. One moment he is just as nice as can be and the next, he is a demon. It gets to me and affects my work performance and my social life to where I just cry more and more. What can I do?
