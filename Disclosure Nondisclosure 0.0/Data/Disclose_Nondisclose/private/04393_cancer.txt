I've been to two (2) clinics and my pcp. I've had an ultrasound only to be told it's a resolving cyst or a hematoma, but it's getting larger and starting to make my leg ache. 
 The PCP said it can't be a cyst because it started out way too big and I swear I have NEVER injured my leg, not even a bump.
---When it started---
I noticed a sightly uncomfortable sensation only when squatting down about 9 months ago. 3 months ago I went to squat down to put away laundry and it kinda hurt. The pain prompted me to examine my leg and that is when I noticed a lump at the bottom of my calf muscle and flexing only made it more noticeable. Two clinic visits, an ultrasound and one pcp later still no answers or guesses. The mass is getting larger. My pcp was supposed to view the u/s results that the clinic ordered, but I haven't heard from him.
My left calf is noticeably bigger than my right. 
  Ok, so now to my question. What type Doctor should I see? I want a CT of my leg because what started out as a tiny marble sized lump is now the size of an egg, it doesn't move freely, it is hard and I CAN FEEL IT IN MY MUSCLE as if is growing into my calf.
