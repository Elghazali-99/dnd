This isn't a question but a comment for any women who's been abused. I am a survivor of domestic violence and I want any women experiencing an abusive partner that u do not deserve to be hit . It'll be a yr in march since I left my ex and even kno it hasn't been easy for me at all I stayed strong because I knew I deserved better !!!!! I was pregnant and that didn't matter he still beat the crap out of me , I was even put in the hospital 2 different times once I thought he broke my arm and the other he threw a camera at me luckily it hit my hand and not my belly . He almost killed my kitten too he threw her into the wall but a vet saved her. This dude put a knife to my neck n threatened to kill me if I ever left him n because he was a gang member I thought I'd be dead for sure n honestly I still worry that his people will Finnish me off . I left him when he was put in jail that's the only thing that saved my life since then he got 5 yrs in prison n has 2 new cases because he can't stop contacting me !!! I want any female going threw the same situation that I did that no man will change , I've heard the oh please baby give me one more chance I promise ill never hit u again speech n all this is bs and lies !!!!!!! U deserve better !!!! Get help there are domestic violence shelters everywhere it happens a lot more than ull kno . If u need someone to talk to I'm here Ima survivor!!!
