I've been really worried lately. I'm a 23 year old male. I'll just get straight into it. My day starts off in a panic and if I don't leave for work by an exact time I start freaking out. If I can't stop by a place to grab a drink I freak out in even more. And when I'm on the highway I just freak out about being on time and I worry so much I sometimes wonder what if I just drive my car into the wall. This all occurs even though I know I'll make it to work on time.
 Once I arrive I get extremely happy and just want to talk to everyone. Within 2 hours I feel lifeless and dull. Or I think of something over and over and repeat what I say in my head. I'm getting distracted by a lot of stuff, down to things that are just colors I like. Sometimes when I'm walking I feel like a part of my body just went through a spider web. And a few times I heard my coworkers ask me a question when no one is around. When I'm given 2+ tasks I feel so overwhelmed I forget them right away. And when given directions or told something I sometimes just can't put 2 and 2 together. A few days ago in the middle of work I started hearing a loud buzzing sound. And when trying to tell someone something I either talk to fast or my brain goes dead and I pause mid sentence.
 I've also had problems sleeping. I stay up all night and can only get at most 4 hours of sleep. I normally say stuff over and over in my head. I'm also sometimes woken up by a high pitch sound. I'm having problems doing daily routine stuff like brushing my teeth. Everything has been worrying me nonstop and it's so overwhelming that I'm starting to cry multiple times a day. I just don't know what's going on and how to approach it.
