First off, I don't want to sound like a childish little brat, that wants everything. Don't hate, because I can't control it. The other day, my mom asked me to do something, until she forced me, that was the time where like, I've completely lost control. I was like an angry ox. I started yelling, I kept pushing her, I started hitting her with my fists that her hands had purple bumps everywhere. I got so mad, that I went to a glass door, and smashed my fist right threw it. My hands were completely, and I mean COMPLETELY full of blood. I felt completely nothing, I only knew about the blood  until I looked at it, I felt absolutely no pain. When she tries to hold me back, I keep yelling for her to go away till my voice is completely gone. This happens nearly everyday, I honestly CAN. NOT. Control it. This happy nearly twice a week. Yesterday, I was nearly going to choke her to death, out of my control. When I get angry, I feel a large amount of energy flowing threw my body, that it throws my body into yelling and fighting. I have no idea what I will do in school, because there very annoying people, and I swear I don't want to jump on anybody else. I don't want for people to get the impression of aggressive about me. What is happening to me? I keep telling them, my doctor and every body else that I can't control it. They just tell me it's hysteria and don't actually want to help. I go to school everyday bruised and full of cuts all over my skin.
