Monday night, my daughter brought her new 7 week old puppy from her mom's house to mine. I am not a dog person, but I don't hate dogs. I love all of God's creatures. This was a 7 week old shih tzu that her mom paid $600 for. It was sweet and playful. That night and the following morning we had to keep it in the bathroom. I was sad that it was so confined so the next night and day we confined it in the kitchen. I made sure there were no cords or anything bad it could get into. Thursday my daughter and I were out of work and school due to winter weather. Friday I woke up at around 2:00 am to go to the bathroom and I went to pet the puppy and it didn't move. I picked it up and it was completely limp. It was dead. There seemed to be a red stain around it's mouth. I was so terrified. I was calling people at 3am. I finally got her mom and told her. The sound of her voice suggested it was my fault.
 I took the little puppy and put her in a bag and put her outside. My daughter woke up the next day to go to school and I told her that Diamond was dead. She was really sad but not taking it hardly as bad as I was and still am.
 She went back to her mom that afternoon.
 Sorry to ramble but I just wanted to give you all an idea of what was going on.
 I have had SAD (Seasonal affective disorder) for a few years now. I hate this time of year. Between that and losing a young puppy, my depression has been like an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10.
 Can I get some advice on therapy or home remedies I can use to get me through this?
