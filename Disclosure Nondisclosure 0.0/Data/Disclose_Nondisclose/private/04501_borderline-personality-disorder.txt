Hi, 
im a new member to this site! I was diagnosed with ADD when i was about 10 years old. I always had a lingering feeling that these med made me a little messed up i the head. For example, I would get very happy for a while then very sad, i would act on almost every impulse and i would spiral into these awful fits of anger were i wouldnt be able to control myself.But about a year ago i started weening myself off these pills and im happy to say i am know 18 years old and no longer take them. But for some reason all th thing that ihought were side effects are still occuring. I still have these crazy mood swings. I also have no true regard for others and how my actions may affect them unless its directly related back to me. Sometimes i will have this feeling of supiriority to everyone around me then suddenly i will feel like im the scum of the earth, There are lots of things different from when i was taking the pills but the one of the key things was my sexual desires. I think the medicine repressed my sexual impulses but now i act upon them as a way to reasure myself  that i was pretty,,,i think i may have borderline personality disorder. I looked it up online and im worried i may have it. Can someone help my figure this out? anyone who has it could just talk to me and tell me if they had these feelings too???
