Hi, I'm an 18 y/o girl. I'm not sure if I'm having depression or not. I've been having insomnia for almost a year - sleeping only at 5am even on school days. I've been feeling worthless and hopeless for very long but it seems like those thoughts are getting worse now. I used to cut when I'm 14 and sometimes I feel like going back to my old ways.
It's getting harder for me to communicate with others, such as my classmates, friends, parents, teachers.
 I'm even isolating myself away from my friends. I want to talk to them again but it feels like I'm not worthy to be their friend. I feel easily tired even if I manage to sleep a lot on weekends or days w/o school. I have very low self-esteem as I am overweight and I have very little hair on my head for a girl.
 I don't know who to seek help from, my mom work in an institute for mental health but I really do not dare to ask her for help. I did think of seeing a psychiatrist but my family isn't that well off financially and I do not want to add on to their burden.
