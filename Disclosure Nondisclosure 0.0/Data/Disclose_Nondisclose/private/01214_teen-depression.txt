Hello question answerers. I'm not really sure if this was the right forum to put this on, but bear with me. ( did I use the right bear/bare?) anyways, back to the important stuff. Im 15 and have been depressed for pretty much a long time. I can't really remember a time when I didn't hate myself. I've gone to the doctor and everything and I'm getting counseling and I'm on medication, but I think I may be in love. There's this guy. He's my best friends brother and he's 18( a little weird, huh?). I've known him and my best friend for my whole life and for some reason he's always stood out to me. And compared to the other boyfriends and crushes I've had, this one beats them all. It's stayed with me since as long as I can remember. Him and I are very close. I can pretty much talk to him about everything and anything. A couple weeks ago, I was spending the night at my bff's house and I was feeling terrible. So i went to him, thinking it was a way to keep me from doing anything stupid. We ended up talking for three hours with plenty of tears (mine) and lots of laughter. We talked everything out and some how we ended up in the cuddling position. It was the greatest moment of my life, so far. The next day everything was normal and fine. We still talk and everything is fine. He still has no idea that I like him so much. A couple of days ago, I'm pretty sure he got back together with his ex. Which is good, because she's nice. All I really want is him to be happy. It kills me inside to watch him with other girls but I know it's for that best. Our ages are to much of a difference. Anyways, is that what love is?  What does it feel like? Do you know what love is automatically?
