Hello,
 Since 1 and a half year ago I noticed some white spots on my left side of the tongue. Usually one white small (1-2 mm) spot appears and then begins to grow in a bigger circle with white margins and red interior until it disappears a week later. The appearance seems to change every day. Sometimes the tongue stays clean several days up to 1-2 weeks and them the spot starts again (sometimes from the same spot, sometimes a few millimeters near but always in the same zone – left side of tongue). Almost always it lasts one week until it disappears. After 2-3 days after it starts I have a small discomfort on that side of the tongue, small burning and tingling.
 I have seen several doctors but they have not be able to diagnose it yet (I have not done a biopsy). For the moment the treatment is “wait and see” :)
 I uploaded 3 photos done in 3 consecutive days from the last “outbreak” that started this week.

 Remarks: 
1/ You may notice in the photos that I have braces. I have them about 8 months after this problem has started say they cannot be the cause.
2/ Sometimes I get a red circle with white borders also on the right side of the tongue but it disappears after 1-2 days.
3/ A few months after it started I was tested for candidiasis and it came back positive. I treated it the re-dit the test and it came back negative. The problem is still present. 
4/ I am a smoker
 Do you have any idea of what this may be? A doctor said that it could be Geographic Tongue but that usually appears on the upper part of the tongue and not from the exact same spot.
 Thank you
