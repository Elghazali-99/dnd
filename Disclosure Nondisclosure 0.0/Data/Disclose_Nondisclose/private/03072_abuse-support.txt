My daughter decided to take a job that keeps her traveling ½ -3/4 of the year.  She leaves her girls home with man #6 while she travels the world, loving every minute of it.  She has not met deadlines that the girls have needed, she is not there when they are sick, and I can tell you from personal experience, he does NOT cook them good meals….also, he has no job of his own.  His job is to take care of her girls and he does a **** poor job of it.  These girls do not especially LIKE this man, but are too afraid to tell their mother this!  My daughter is ruining her children’s minds!  My oldest granddaughter’s grades have dropped dramatically, and the younger one (only 8 years old) is having horrible nightmares that something is going to happen to her mother or that someone is robbing their house.  There is no security for these girls.  My older granddaughter spends most of her weekends with another family, and absolutely hates her home life when her mother is not there.  
 However, my daughter does not regret a minutes of her Travels….she is so selfish in that regard.  It is just nuts.  At Christmas, she promised the girls gifts AFTER Christmas because she could not afford them AT Christmas.  They have still not received them.  The girls have not been to the dentist in over two years, but their mother has weekly manicures and facials, and just got back from Hong Kong where she bought herself $500 in custom made clothing.  
 I just cannot get over this.  Is it her or is it me?
