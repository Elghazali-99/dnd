I don't have anybody who cares about me-
 The times I've said that to people I'm always told it must not be true--that *of course* people care. But they don't.
 I don't have siblings and my parents divorced when I was 2. My dad left and is remarried now to a woman who can't stand me, so I don't get to see him anymore. My mother's always told me to be more like other people--that I'm not good enough. There's no family support.
 People who used to be friends aren't anymore. I moved far away for school and I guess I was just forgotten about. Nobody has included me in things for years and if I'm not the one who makes the effort, I don't hear from people for years (literally)
 I've been feeling so alone and it's getting harder every day.
 Professionally, I don't have a future---university marks were just released and I didn't do well. 
All of my used-to-be close friends are moving on and progressing and I'm in this stagnant place w/o a future. 
 Nobody cares and I just feel so sad.
