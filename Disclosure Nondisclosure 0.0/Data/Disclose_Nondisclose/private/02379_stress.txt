Hi, I'm looking for some advice. I'm very stressed out right now. I'm a 19 year old college student. My family doesn't have much money and I had a lot of trouble coming up with the money for this semester. A friend of mine parent's helped me with the remaining money I needed for my tuition but it left me with a 950 account balance that I can pay throughout the semester and I'm stressed I'm not going to be able to pay it. My parents have to pay 250 a month for my schooling too and I'm worried they wont be able to afford it. This is stressing me out and all of the debt from school is putting a lot of pressure on me. Also my cat passed away today while I was on Skype with my mom and sister whom were holding her. I also have some health issues that are getting to me and I have been un able to see my doctor because my insurance got cancelled in July. I have valve disease and stomach issues. All of this plus the regular college stressful life is really getting to me. Can someone please help me figure our what to do and help me with this stress? Should I withdrawl this semester and get my 75% refund? But I really need my degree to have a better life and if I take time off I might not ever come back to it. I dont know what to do.
