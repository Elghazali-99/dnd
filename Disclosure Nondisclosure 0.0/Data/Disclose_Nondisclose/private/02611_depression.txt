I really need someone to talk to.  I feel like my world is crashing in.  I am so tired of everything.  my niece had arms surgery on both arms,  big mistake.  she has been in severe pain since her surgery monday 15.  I have been doing my best to take care of her.  none of  our family has even called or offered to take her to the doctor.  she cant drive for 2 weeks.  I fussed my niece out and she did not know.  but my nieces daughter put in on facebook.  so she knew I know she told everyone.  we are going to the doc. tomorrow hopefully to have the drain tubes out and remove any stitches that have not dissolved.  she is wearing a compression garment that is really tight.  she is not who has me upset.  my sis her mom.  cold has not called or even showed an inkling.  I am through with my family.  they are not worth all the problems that come with them.  my nieces sister started calling tonight.  we were going to bed early to get to the doctor in the morning.  we are both nervous about tomorrow it is going to hurt a lot.  I did not answer the phone finally I took the phone off the hook she kept waking my niece up.  am I wrong.  they have never been there when I needed not while dad died not while I had cancer not when my hubby died not for the 6 years that I took care of my mom with alzeimers and conjestive heart problems.  am I wrong to walkaway and  say that is enough.  mandy876
