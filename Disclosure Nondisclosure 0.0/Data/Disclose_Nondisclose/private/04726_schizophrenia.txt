Before I start, yes, I've been diagnosed with all sorts a shyt. But labels are just that....labels. Anyways, dunno how to say this....so here:
 I believe I can fly....no R.Kelly crap either. Sometimes I get my suicidal thoughts mixed with my flying dreams.... I used to wear my costumes in the hospital.... I felt SO empowered!!!! I know I can! I've had sleeping dreams of it! I was soaring! It felt SO GOOD!!!! No strings like in movies....I tried it before, it didn't work b.c of my meds, I can't take them when im flying....they weigh me down. IM not really afraid.... Like, When I did try it, I busted my knee, and the other one hurts really bad still.... It happened in 2010, June. Huge knot still, burns....
 I guess my question is....would it be essential to tell my therapist this information????
 It's not a big deal, I mean, I just can't diferentiate my flying from dying....guess b.c they both set you free, but flying is away better. Your empowered, you can feel it!!!!
Sorry, so, any comments/answers???? Please????
