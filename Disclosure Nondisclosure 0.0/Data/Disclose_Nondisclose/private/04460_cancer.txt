December before christmas I've fellt a little swollen lymph node on the right side of my neck. I didn't worried about it because I'm always with a persinstent dandruff and at that time i've had a skin allergie for one week. In January I went to the doctor about this node but he seemed not to worry and said it was because I was having gengivitis.OK, this node did shrink but not disappeared.
 In February I've felt another one on the left side, and then i went to another doctor who sent me to CBC and ultrasound. CBC was normal except that showed I've had Cytomegalovirus once in my life but it wasn't active in my body. The ultrasound showed two lymph nodes 2,6 x 0,6 and 2,3 x 0,9 in both sides jugulo digastric chain, both normal and no signs of malignancy. So my doctor said me to don't touch them and wait that they are normal.Had a chest x ray normal.
So I've had another ultrasound, one node shrunk a little and other grow 1mm . I think it's insignificant because I was poking it too mutch before the last ultrasound.
Can someone help me? I'm thinking about stop searching for something and relax but don't know what to do.
(no symptoms beside lymph nodes)
