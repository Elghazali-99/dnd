well, alright.
 From the age of 5 or so( i dont' quite remember) til teh age of 14 i was seuxually abuse dby a cousin of mine.  emotioallyand physicallya s well.  i never thought to stand up to him, i'd learned all my life that standign up to him only brought on pain.  So this summer, at age 19, i finally revealed teh whole thing to my family.  i had previously told my fiance and my best friend about the episodes, and they had helped me through the process of telling.
 my issue is this: i have been tryign to get over everythig, but its still everso difficult.  whever i have sex i flashback, not alwasy, but occasionally, and my finace feels terrible, eh feels he's hurt me in some way, i need to knwo how to ehhlp him feel comfortable.  even when i have flashbacks.  teh flashibacks hit me out of no where. and i know im alright with physical touch. . .  tis jsut tha sometimes the things tha tmy finace does reminds me or the specific things my cousin did to me.  I jstu need to know a way of.... helping my fiance to be comfortable with me. so that he doens't feel guilt for what my cousin did to me....becaus that is the last hting that i coudl possible want.
 Any suggestions?
