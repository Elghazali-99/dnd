I had a occupational injury 7 months ago, I have been on wcomp for 4 months now.  I finally had surgery 12 days ago.  I was in a walking bot for 5 months and now with a triple subtlatr joint fusion with ligament repair I am unable to walk and recovery will be close to a good 8-12 months.  ANYWAYS the entire experience with Wcomp and a awful HR dept/company I work for has made my experience awful to say the least.  I am house bound now and am recently able to use a knee scooter.  I have Noticed a SUDDEN shift in myself I CANT or Dont sleep well. Once regular schedule with my spouce 10-7, but now 3am-noon.  I CANT eat or have little to No appetite I have nausa 80% of the time and feel not blah but can pin point it.  I just have no feeling.  I shower at night right before my spouce comes home, and am in Pj's all the time. Now his part may be due to what is easiest with my mobility the shower Pj thing. I was on a 2 low dose pain meds for the 1st week.  I dont feel right at all and am beginning to worry.  I cant describe how I feel, I dont have any random or scary thoughts but I KOWN this is not normal for me and I dont like it at all.   I think that my entire injury/wcomp ordeal may be the key.  PLEASE ADVISE
