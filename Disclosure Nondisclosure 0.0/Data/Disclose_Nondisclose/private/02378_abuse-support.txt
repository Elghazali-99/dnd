Well, when I was growing up, my mother made fun of me. She made pig-snorting noises at me because I was a little overweight and she called me a different assortment of curse words and rude things such as...
-dumb***
-little fu*****
-lazy a**
She also always told me to "shut the f*** up". My mother never drank/did drugs, but she always made me feel bad. Plus, she screamed and yelled and complained all the time. 
My father always screamed and yelled, and I never trusted him or felt comfortable around him and I was scared to be around him, because he grabbed me by the jaw as a child and shook me around, and squeezed my arms really hard and shook me around until I cried. My mom stopped him sometimes. I was going to tell a principle at school, but I was scared if nothing happened, I would be stuck with mom and dad, and they would be very angry around me. My older brother would punch me a lot if I listented to music he didn't like, and he beat the tar out of me. He was very agressive. My other brother was nice to me, but he was really my half brother and my father hated him soo much. Growing up, my best friend was a dog and when he died, life never seemed harder for me.
I admit, my life growing up could have been worse, but it could have been better.
I was just wondering, my dad's behavior, would it be considered abuse now a days?
