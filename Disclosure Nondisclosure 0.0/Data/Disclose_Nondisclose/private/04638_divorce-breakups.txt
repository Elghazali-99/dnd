My boyfriend of a year or so recently broke up with me. I know its for the best as he was emotionally abusive and had some issues as well with ptsd from the army.and i pushed him away as i do everyone. It has taken me a while to realize that but i understand now. But I still really love him i know he has some problems and i know deep down he is a good person if he would just let some one help him. His best friend and his parents no longer speak to him becuase of the way he treats people. He had an ex wife who he treated bad as well. Before we broke up we were aruing a lot i moved away to be with him and couldnt find a job so i was stressed out...and had recently lost my mom. When i moved out he helped me pack all my stuff and drove the moving truck for me ( i live 2 or so hours away ) to a storage and helped me un pack everything...not to mention paid for all the gas for the truck.... i had to drive him back and since it was a long drive i stayed to get some sleep and he kissed me on the cheek the next morning and bought me lunch before i left.  i thought he was just being nice or feels guilty becuase the whole time he kept telling me how much he still loves me and how hard this is for him. He texted me that night and the next night from there we both have texted each other, the other day he told me he may have a job overseas he text me and was so happy ....i was happy for him and i recently got offered a job where he lives well were we lived too. it was from an old app i put in and he told me to take it.....huh....he will start the texts happy and then sometimes its like im bothering him. almost like he is waiting for me to tell him i want him back... im confused why is he even texting me and why he is happy one moment then irratated the next. I dont know maybye were playing games i dont know if we are being honest with each other...Im tired of the pain . Im not sure what he wants
