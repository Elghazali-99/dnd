im  wondering if my partner is having a mid life crisis as a year a half ago he was put on sick from work after working constantly for over 20years he was fine at first but them slowly withdrawing to the bedroom then his mother suddenly passed away donating her body to science so there was no final goodbye then he was complaining about silly things not eating not shaving or cleaning himself just laying around upstairs away from everyone he then complained of the noise of the grandkids saying he couldnt take it and much more he was off i came home from work one morning to find him gone he got in touch not long after started visiting then finally came back he seemed better in his self more calm we spoke of things we needed to do together as our eldest daughter had moved out  with the grandkids he was constantly telling me he loved me we planned moving for a fresh start but then suddenly he told me he had slept with someone else and that he had walked away all this was over the phone while i was at work i left work to get home to find him gone again he had left me a letter saying that he loved me and hoped i could forgive him in the future he rang a day later and again after that then i didnt hear from him till 3/4 mths later we spoke then a week or so later he turned up he said that he had most things sorted in his head and he knew he had let me down he told his daughter he was back to stay and his family and he wouldnt hurt me again he talked about people he was hanging round with getting into trouble with the police he seemed to drink more his attitude seemed to have changed to how he was when i first met him like he had been trying to relive his youth he complained of dizzy spells he stillkept telling me he loved me his sex drive was not as it was he didnt behave out of character but was upstairs all the time playing games again i came home from work he had gone leaving a letter saying he loved me and he thought i was great but things didnt feel the same and he thought it best to go as he cant seem to settle in one place for too long all this has happened in the past 16/18 months before all this we were solid together is it amid life crisis or has he found someone else
