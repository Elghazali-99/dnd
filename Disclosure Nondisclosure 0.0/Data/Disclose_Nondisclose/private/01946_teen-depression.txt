I'm 13 and a female, I think I'm depressed.  I feel sad and guilty all the time, like I'm not sure I can't really explain it, it's just I feel like everything I do is wrong and that I can't change it. I get really angry sometimes and I yell at people but then I just start crying, like I can't control my moods.  This has been happening for like a month.
My friend was doing a project on depression for school and she made me sit down and have a talk with her, saying that she thinks I might have depression, and told me to maybe go talk to my parents. So I took her advice and went to my parents, I started talking to my mom, who I barely see, she works and I have sports and projects and things. The most I see her is an two hours a day, and when I said I though I was depressed she said she had to go to sleep. S I gave up with her. I tried with my dad and he said that I was just making myself think I was depressed and that I need more sunshine.  Later I tried again with my mom, she said I was going through a phase.
I don't know what to do, is it a phase or am I depressed, I have cut myself but I stopped and I have thought that maybe people's life would be easier without me, but then I tried last year and my parents found out and I didn't want them to be mad at me again.
Help please
