My symptoms
Male , 22, Overweight - Anxiety/Asthma
Shortness of breath on a regular basis without tiring myself out.
Regular pains in lungs/heart area of upper chest both sides and sometimes in upper back both sides.
Weakness/fatigue on a regular basis without any actions or tiring myself out.
Often severe headaches.
Often become dizzy when bending over or getting out of bed or just randomly taking dizzy turns out of no where.
Numbness in mouth/hands/arms and neck.
Sharp pains in throat sometimes.
Blurred vision every day & night whenever reading, watching tv, using a computer or even looking at the sky or anything that is bright.
Weird flickering/flashing lights in the corner of my left eye as I look to the side and back every day.
Sleepless nights and regular panic attacks.
Sleep paralysis often experienced whenever I fall asleep in the day time after a sleepless night.
Weird tingling/vibration feeling in my heart upon each beat as if it is rubbing against something.
Sharp pains in ears.
Asthma attacks every couple of months.
My hands are freezing cold almost all the time no matter what I'm doing, how warm it is or what I am wearing.
I am suffering from lack of sleep because I can't focus my mind on anything other than my heart problems and being overweight.
I have constant heartburn every meal, no matter what I eat or drink other than milk, everything gives me pains in my heart/lungs and bad heartburn.
 And right now I have noticed a large amount of swelling under my left breast and there appears to be a lump inside (hard) like a stone/marble about the size of a fingertip from what I can feel and it is very painful if I touch it. The lump is inside and not on the out, however the swelling shows easily and my left breast underneath is a lot bigger than the right.
 Do you have any idea as to what this lump might be or anything else related to the above symptoms?
I have not seen a doctor yet but I will very shortly as this is terrifying.
