Hi. I've been under an extreme amount of stress for a little over a year. In some ways things got better so I was surprised that I wasn't feeling better. I started getting physical symptoms about 6 months ago when I started getting PVC's. Got everything checked out, heart seems fine. Then I started having stomach pains. Finally they discovered I had a mass in my small intestine. I got the surgery 3 months ago to take it out. They think I may have Crohns. I recovered from my surgery nicely and no more stomach pains. However, I'm exhausted all the time. I feel like I'm not sleeping well. During the day I feel headachy, tired and slow thinking. I have no energy. I don't feel like doing anything. It's a chore just to get simple household chores done. There's still some stress in my life but it's not as bad as it was. 
Could this just be lingering symptoms from all the stress I've been under? Also, can stress cause a lot of the physical symptoms I've had? I'm trying new healthier ways of eating and vitamins. I just don't like feeling like this. I want to feel better and have energy again. I feel like I can't even concentrate. Everything takes effort. What's wrong with me?
