Hi. 2 years ago I did an ultrasound scan on my neck and it said 2 swollen lymph nodes in one side seen and the sizes were 12*6 and 12*7 mm. I did many blood test like CBC,ESR, peripheral blood smear for many times and many specialists like ENT and Oncologyst told me I'm fine. 
After 1 year I did another ultrasound scan and dr said there is no lymph nodes, But 2 months ago I did another and dr saw many lymph nodes in one side of my neck, but the biggest one was just 10*4 mm and other was smaller too. I took some antibiotics and went for another sonography in other place the dr laughed at me and said it was nothing and no need to follow up then did the scan thing and told there are lymph nodes but all of theme are under 5 mm in short axis and this is normal and normal and normal.
 An internal disease specialist saw the results and tell me i'm fine.
I did some blood work like CBC, ESR, peripheral blood smear again all was normal and an HIV test that was negative, my only symptom is night sweats they are not every night but sometimes they are too much.
 And now I'm feeling some hard nodes in my groin and I know they are lymph nodes.
 Here is my question with these little nodes and normal blood tests and 1 symptom what is my risk of getting cancer?Lymphoma? I heard many people with normal tests had lymphoma.
 Please Help me.
