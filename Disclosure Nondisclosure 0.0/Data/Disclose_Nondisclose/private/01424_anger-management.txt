hi i am a 17 year old male i work have 3 brothers one is a twin and have a great mate
most of the time i am a friendly person but i have this side to me that i am worried about.
my head is pretty messed up when i am at work or have some spare time i daydream about killing people i think about going into a hospital and disguising my self as a doctor and grabbing  a syringe and putting a dangerous chemical in it and injecting it into people and thinking of ways to cover my tracks. i have really weird mood swings like i will be happy and laughing then if someone says something that annoys me i will be enraged with anger and wanting to hurt and kill people but i normally keep my cool but i am worried one day i will lose it. i cant concentrate at work because all i do is worry about things and thinking of killing people. i forget things and will not get any sleep and lose interest in food  but i never show any of this when people are around its always bottled up inside me. and i am worried i might be developing a mental illness i am sure i'm not alone with these crazy thoughts.
