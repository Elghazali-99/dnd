not sure i can type up my whole story...its too long.... the short of it is... i was in a very abusive marriage for about 17 years.  I finally left 1.5 years ago but even now he continues to make my life helll. I hate him so much that it eats me up inside. I havent healed in this past year and a half. My wounds still feel as raw as they did back then. I cant obtain counselling- no health insurance-  and the "free services offered by the county" are overpacked, underfunded etc.  I just dont know how to cope much anymore and he is continually finding ways to get to me from afar even. Threatning to blow my cats head off and doing bad stuff when our 2 little boys visit with him. He talks bad about me to them and when they come back from a day with him, they act out towards me with hostility and namecalling. thankfully they are sweet and sensitive boys and they quickly realize what they said or did was wrong and cuddle with me and apologize, and soon they return to their normal selves until they have to go visit him again.  and now recently on a visit, their dad had a rage/tantrum in front of them and tore all the "papers" off his fridge- sent magnets flying everywhere, papers got torn and ruined. these "papers" were things the kids had painted/drawn/school papers. Some of them said "i love you dad" and "I love you mom" on them.  I was furious when i heard about it, and then cried my eyes out. Im so sick of this, but dont know what to do =(    The depression is really starting to hit me hard lately from this.
