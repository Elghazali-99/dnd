Ok long story short. My girlfriend has been on Zoloft 2 years, before we met.. We have been dating 8 months everything was nice, and normal. She was sweet, caring, and understanding of everything. Then she ran about about a month, and a half ago. For the last month she has blew up at every small thing there is. She is very hard to talk to, its like she see's it as a huge problem if I ask a question, and that'll just make her just blow up even more, or be snappy. I mean she is hurting me, and if I mention that. I'll get well why do you wanna be with me then if I'm hurting you?? It's like she no longer cares about us at all. Things that didn't even used to matter is a issue now. If I ask a question, I get blown up at, and told I'm trying everything in the world to please everyone. Baby cry's for one sec, she gets mad.. Everything in the world is basically a issue now. She snaps at basically everything now. She really isn't the same person since she quit taking them, I've never seen her act like this in my life. If our relationship was at stake usually shed all be trying to fix it, or apologize, or even cry now she's more of an angry mean person that don't really care, That says I dunno anything anymore... Then she'll say she does care the next day, and loves me and she never letting go etc, and sometimes cry, and say she was just frustrated, and then act like nothing never happened. Then the next day be distant as can be, and really quick to talk, or text, and be snappy. Then another day the most loving caring person again? I don't get it at all? Can Zoloft withdrawal really cause all this?  She blames being off the meds as a big part in the way she is acting. She told me to make her an appointment with a doctor she don't have the time she works etc (which she just recently started, which is also causing stress to her)... I'm not sure if I can do that for her I told her. But I'd try to get her a doctor. Seems she even got mad about that..
