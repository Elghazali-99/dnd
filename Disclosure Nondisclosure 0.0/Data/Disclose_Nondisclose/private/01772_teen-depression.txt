In front of adults and teachers, my friends and I seem like your average 15 year olds. At night on weekends and long breaks, we all change. I live on Long Island NY, and it seems like a great place to live. What most people don't know is we can get alchol and drugs just about anywhere. The past three nights we've been drunk/high. I'm just tired of it! We don't have anything fun to do anymore, so we turn to boys, alchol and drugs. I know this is going to sound slutty, but I've made the biggest mistakes of my life in the past month. Not to pour out my soul or anything, but I went down 6 times. I hate myself, and what I'm becomming. I miss it just a year ago, drinking was an occasional thing, not an every night thing. I just really wanna get caught with beer or something and actually get in trouble. I want my parents to tell me no for once, and I want them to act more like they care, even though I know that they do so much. If I was your daughter and you knew what I've experienced in the past year, you'd never let me leave my house again. Please give me some help on what to do with myself and my life, because unlike my friends, I actually care about my future
