So heres the deal when I was 10 I went on this vaca with my brother to Puerto Rico where my family is from,my brother stay with my grandma n I stay with my aunt. One day when she went to work my uncle decide to take a game or goofing around to holding me down ripping my clothes off (which his was already down) n trying to rape me as I kick n push the neighbor of God save me n yell his name but he didnt really know what was going on he just need to get something but I ran n lock myself in the room. (after that I went to my grandma) Am 23 now n life is great bah bah bah. But this subject is on my mind 24/7 I really wanna tell little bit of ppl in my fam (cuz they dont know yet) but scare that it will turn my fam upside down. I really wanna tell his son but scare to because I dont want.anyone to judge. When my uncle comes to PA where am at now I act like nothing happen but deep down I really wanna speak up n tell people and his son. What should I do? Should I let it go n never talk about it or should I just tell them no matter what comes out of it
