I am not sure if I this even the right forum to post on because I read what other people go through and my issues seem so small...but I am really confused about some aspects of my relationship. I have been with my husband for 8 years and I am so confused if this relationship is abusive. He has never truly hurt me but has slapped me, pushed me and kicked me. Each time these incidents happened he just completely exploded over small things like me spilling wine or coming home from work late without letting him know. He frequently calls me careless and tells me I could never survive on my own. He doesnt apologize and just tells me that I made him angry and seems to feel no remorse. He has often trivialized these incidents making me feel like I blew it out of proportion. He is not particularly jealous but gets angry or sulky if I make plans without letting him know. I have often cancelled plans last minute because he wanted me home that night. He can be very loving and I dont want to give up on him. We tried counselling when I threatened to leave once but that seemed to make things worse, he felt like he was getting bullied. Is there any hope. We have a son together and I am getting concerned that he is not seeing a relationship of equals.
