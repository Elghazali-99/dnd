I'm 41 years old and starting to have hormone problems.  I've begging my doctor for 3 years, that something wasn't right.  I finally went out on my own and found a hormone specialist that does bioidentical hormones.  My symptoms are sleeplessness, anxiety, foggy thinking, weight loss, nervousness, dry eyes, eczema, short periods, etc.  She ran a complete lab profile on me and everything was pretty normal except my hormone levels.  My progesterone was very low as was my testosterone.  She started me on Prometrium 100mg 12-28 of my cycle.  I felt great on my 1st round, slept great, confident, no more foggy brain.  So now I'm on day 4, not on anything and all the previous symptoms are returning with a vengeance.  Is this a side effect or do I just need to buckle down accept it and count down the days to 12 for relief again.  My doctor wanted to get my levels up before she started me on the creams, so my next appointment isn't until May.  My questions are is this normal, should I call her and maybe get something started sooner with the compound pharmacy to get some relief?  Kinda feel like I'm loosing my mind again.  Thanks for any help.
