I am 46 years old.  I went 11 months without having a period and thought I was finally hitting menopause.  I was told when I was in my late 30's that I was pre-menopausal then.  I had irregular periods prior to that and had an endomentrial ablasion (sp) back in 2007.  February, I started having very light (talking panty liner light) periods that are coming every month now.  I had a transabdominal and transvaginal pelvic u/s.  Results say "shows the uterus to measure 9.0 x 4.5 x 5.1 cm with homogeneous echogenicity.  The endomentrium is measured at 1.3 cm in thickness.  the right ovary measures 1.8 x 2.2 x 1.7 cm with normal echogenicity.  The transvaginal imaging shows a thickened endometrium at 1.4 cm with some cystic areas in the endometrial canal.  The largest of these cystic areas measures 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm.  The left ovary measures 2.4 x 3.9 x 1.9 cm and contains a cyst measuring 2.3 x 1.7 cm.  The right ovary measures 3.0 x 2.8 x 1.7 cm with normal echogenicity and vascularity.  The uterus has a hypoechoic area anteriorly to the left at the fundus measuring 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.8 cm.  The myometrium is overall heterogeneous.  Impression - thickened endometrium with multiple tiny cystic areas.  Left fundal fibroid.  Left ovarian cyst."  They want to do a D&C and Hysteroscopy.  My procedure is scheduled for August 3 due to my husband being out of town until then and cannot change it.  Is this something I should get done NOW and not wait?  Does this sound cancerous?  What could it be?
