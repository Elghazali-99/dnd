maybe the logic of psychiatry is baffelling, especially if you;re in a disturbed state.  I mainly found I had a problem with sleep deprivation but believe it came from stress..the anxiety and sleep deprivation and combination of the two came later plus some disturbance in my psychic activity that I consider normal and usually function well, had only just moved house god kknows how many times and wasn;t happy, it was crammed and importantly my excercise regime suffered, I did chigong and had overcome psychiatric stigma [at least almost-refer to psychiatrist thinking its a persecutory delusion= I just did a tangent, so what MF]...my insight doesn't comply with my diagnosis that I am schizophrenic and the sleep deprivation is a symptom.  Therefore I lack insight and can be forcefully administered antipsychotics regardless of my knowledge that I will recover without them or pointing the psychiatrist limited knowledge of natural human states, psychosis is poorly understood.  Everything I know is a sign of non-compliance and lack of insight and to strike down harder and legally make that decision for me regardless of how it doesn;t comply with my beliefs.  Make a quack seem much like acting on a NAZI agenda.
 I have studied taoism for quite a long time and had an interest in herbal medicine and alchemy, the alchemy came more from meditation practices and breathwork and cultivating my energy in to circualtion like microcosmic orbit, so the human doesn;t leak energy from the mind, like the mind is a bridge to the outside world full of attachments and desire and consequences... I put myself at a level with a psychiatrist in a diheaveled state and demand recognition.  This is called delusions of granduer, cleverly one psychiatrist got it right and called it spirtitual delusions of grandeur.
