Hi thanks for reading. Beginning to sound like a broken record! 
 I have been treated for depression in the past. The last few months I've kept track and it seems to be just more than a week before my period it all starts. 
  It is so so awful. My outlook completely changes. I don't want to get out of bed. I don't want to do anything. The thought of having to endure other people is absolutely vile. 
 My relationships with others really struggle within this period. I feel so internally angry and try my best not to snap. Now I've started realising it is before my period I'm like this I try to tell myself that's all it is. 
  I'm in the thick of it right now which seems like the best time to write about it. I just feel so so low. I have moments where I feel pointless and everything around me is pointless. I feel guilty that I feel that way. I'm so annoyed that i feel like I'm doing this to myself. I sometimes feel so worthless and that infuriates me more because it sounds like a pity party. 
 I have been trying to help myself and have changed things like my diet which was a big thing for me, I make everything like sauces and things from scratch, a take away is maybe once a month. I have upped my water and drink a really good amount everyday. I have increased my exercise in a bid to help too. It may not seem like a lot to others but I take my dog out for a solid hour or more walking in the evenings and most mornings. I really am trying but this seems to be the worst month for quite a while. 
 I have never wanted my period to come so much as things quickly return to normal. 
  Has anyone ever had anything similar? 
 I'm scared to go to the doctor because it feels silly in a way. 
 Any tips and recommendations? I am desperate for help
