I am a 15 year old guy. Throughout middle school I had a group of 4 unbelievably close friends (guys) and a few other friends outside of that but was never disliked by anybody. I was expelled in grade 8 for something I wouldn't really like to get into cause its irrelevant :p but when I went to highschool a year later with all the same people, my old friend base (who were also expelled) kind of split up. One was still in jail, one became really popular, one became obsessed with school.
 It isn't like I have no friends. People still act generally friendly towards me. I have a best friend (guy) and a girlfriend of 1 year.
 Now though, without my old group of friends who I saw and talked to everyday, I feel lonely. I rarely text anybody. I don't have any female friends and one real friend total but I don't even talk to him as much lately. Just curious if anybody has a similar problem or solution.
 Not sure what the rules for the forum are because I couldn't find them but if someone wanted to talk, I can always email or text and would appreciate any help :p
