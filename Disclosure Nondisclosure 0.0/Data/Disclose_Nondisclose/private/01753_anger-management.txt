Hi all,
I think I know why I am so darn angry all time but thought I'd get it all out! plus what to do? I have no idea...
To back track..when I was little we were taught to not question adults, you do not argue period....as a teenager I was so shy and anti social, well...in high school I did have some really good friends but at about age 17 I would run and hide in my bedroom if someone came over, I was so "scared" of everything, my dad was an alcoholic, my mom to this day says she thought I was just "normal"..it wasn't normal....all through my 20's I could hardly speak to people, it became so bad I would literally freeze with fear...and people stomped all over me, I said nothing.,...now I'm in my 40's and can talk to people, but...I am sooooo angry all the time and I mean all the time!! I am ready to pounce!!
 After years of being treated so badly by people, incuding all my own family, and getting blamed if I dare retaliate....eg: my sister who I've not seen in years and called me about our mother being ill...she just HAD to say something mean to me.....our brother can be the biggest *** yet she favors him......I let those 2 go years ago...no good...
I've gone completely the other way, if someone says something nasty to me my anger level rises to an all time high!
I keep telling myself..calm down but I can't...I scream and rant and rave on and on until I'm exhausted, in the car I pound the darn steering wheel....I hate being this way....I want to be a different person...anyway..on that note I'm saying hi to everyone and hopefully I can learn something by being on here! :)
