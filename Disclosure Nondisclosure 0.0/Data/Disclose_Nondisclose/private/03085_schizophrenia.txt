Ok, I'm concerned about my mental health. I looked up the symptoms because my big brother has it, and I wanted to know what he was going through. I read that I may have quite a few. I read that if a 1st relation has it, I may have it (my brother), I constantly feel watched (and always on my edge), I find it hard to consentrate, I always have distracting thought running through my head, I sometimes think people dislike me, for usually no reason, I just have a feeling. I read it can start in the teens, I'm 14. I'm really worried. I read it shortened your life by 15 to 20 years. I just really need to get it out there, I need an answer. I don't think  I'm dangerous, mainly because I have no muscles, but I always have to tell myself not to lash out or scream or cry or tell someone where they can go. I'm sorry if my grammer is hard to understand, I tend to talk using my own kind of grammer sometimes. Sometimes I feel really angry, or sad, or frustrated, or sick. I dunno. My grades are just about holding, but I can't take in any information when I study. I always daydream, sometimes not nice thoughts to me. Am I just weird or is my clock ticking funny? Please help, thanks!
