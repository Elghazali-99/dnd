My wife and I have 3 kids (5 years, 2 1/2, and 7 months). They are all great kids.  When I cam home from work most days, I observed her yelling (angry) at the kids (the two older ones) and I figured it was a long day and she was just worn out, and had a short fuse at the end of the day. I would step in and help coral the kids and give her a break, so she didn't have to deal with it. well, I have been off of work for several weeks and had a chance to observe her with the kids all day for many days in a row. It isn't just at the end of the day. It's all day, every day, every time they don't listen or misbehave. It seems to be her standard reaction whenever she is displeased with the kids. As far as I know, she did not grow up getting yelled at. I've known her and her family since she was 15. I just don't know what to do about it. I have brought it up with her, and she just reacts defensively, I suggest other methods, and she dismisses the suggestions. I rarely have to yell at our kids, and then only a bark to get attention, never the angry tirades she delivers to them. I know she loves them, I just don't know what to do with this situation. Any ideas?
