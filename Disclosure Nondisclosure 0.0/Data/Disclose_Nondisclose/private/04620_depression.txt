I am separated. It hurts to think that the man I loved has just used me.I never think of that but lots of people tells me that he is my husband and I love him (still) and I never wannat think that way. He absused me mentally & physically. As a wife, I thought I should be very patient & understanding. He loves to drink hard drinks and he hides them everywhere at home.  First I didn't undrstand why he is always pick a fight until I found those drinks hidden. He gets very mean, rude & v disrespectful that I would start arguing with him.. He would grab me and my shirt and even drag me on the floor if I try to leave the house. He is a big lair. He told on me that I am the abuser. Then he said he only did it because his lawyer told him.  All the blame and pain and suffer went on me. I think its not fair. I want to get even by having him in place where he should be (deported). But I can't do it. Everyday now I would cry. He droped off a flowers and champaigne out the door on Thanksgiving. He comes to my work. But then ya, my friends said in his situation he is doing that so I dont take action to tell immigration what he did to me. He never told his parents he was married w/me when he promised he will after we get married. Me the stupid, trying to be the understanding person agreed and show him my support and waited patiently. We were separated and filed divorce on July . It was a relieve at first. When he comes to see me he wants something so he can file his gc he gets so upset when one time i didn't bring what he needed. He scares me. . I told him to stop going to my work. It work and I felt better when he did. But he didnt stop. Each time I get scared of what next he wants. He started coming again and now I am on mix emotion. Is he doing it because he was sorry or just because his lawyer told him?  I cry everyday now for almost 2 weeks now. I'm confused what he wants from me. But he seems happy being free anyways but why does he bother. Its giving me lots of pain!
