I was in a 6 year relationship with a wonderful person.  The last 3-4 months of the relationship he started accusing me of emailing other men, all kinds of crazy things.  One night, he all of a sudden packs his things and leaves.  He tells me to "tell him the truth", but the truth is I've done nothing, he didn't believe me.  This was about 2 months ago or so, we have seen each other since but he always goes into these moods were he feels I am and have been messing around. He also has these ideas where he feels that everyone is plotting against him.  Alot of the things he is doing are almost textbook of paranoid schizophrenic.  He refuses to see a Dr..  In fact, he says that 'Im the one who needs to see a Dr.  He has called me all sorts of names and brought up some very personal things about my past.  He has never acted like this until here recently.  My problem is that this man was very good to me, we got along great.  All of a sudden he ups and leaves and that's it.  Am I supposed to not feel anything over this?  I find myself missing our relationship, missing him and wanting very much to see and talk to him.  This happened so sudden, it is very painful for me.  How do I deal with these feelings? I find myself crying alot and feeling very empty inside. Is there any type of support out there?
