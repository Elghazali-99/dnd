I get angry very easily over the smallest things. I do not like when ppl make it seem like I'm dumb. Yes. This really upsets me. My boyfriend does this a lot & when I call him on it he says he doesn't! Well were talking about finding housing & I'm in the process & making my moves & doing what I need to do(in the meantime hes not doing jack) I have an appointment with an housing advisor today. I call him yesterday give him the good news. He calls back wuth all these questions I give answers,they arent good enough,hangs up calls me right back,more questions,more answers,still not good enough,hangs up calls me right back make sure u pick me up tomorrow for that appointment. I say for what? Now he wants to look at the housing list,the advisor has available. Umm no. so I text him&ask him why is he acting like I dont know what I'm doing? He calls me I'm not acting like you don't know what you doing, then in the next breath saus you must not know what you doing or "we'd have a place by now. I INSTANTLY GOT MAD&STATRED YELLING AND SREAMING AT HIM. THEN BANGED ON HIM BANGED=hung up. Now he hasnt made any effort to help me look or say I ssen a house or I called a potential landlord or anything like that. Hr doesn't even know how the system works. But had threw nerve to tell me I don't know what I'm doing! Now I'm not saying all this to boyfriend bash. I'm saying all this because I feel I had every right to be offended&get angry. I think if I had been near him I wouldve got physical. For the simple fact he insulted my intelligence on a subject I been dealing with for years&he knows nothing about. I posted this in the stress community because I know the way that I get angry in a split second is a big stress trigger&im wondering what can I do to calm myself before I explode? Especially when my intelligence is insulted by a hs dropout. Im getting mad just reviewing the whole situation.
