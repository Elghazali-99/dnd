I strongly believe my mother has Borderline Personality Disorder or Bipolar Disorder/Depression.
 The symptoms I noticed:
 --Uncontrollable fits of rage at inappropriate situations (even something I see as a small misunderstanding instead makes her go into a fit of rage, yelling, screaming, etc.,)
--Extreme mood swings. She can go from rage mode to laughing at something on TV and be in a good mood again three minutes later.
--She has "intense and stormy" relationships with her children (my sister and I), my dad (her husband), her friends, her family, etc., Her relationships are very unstable.
--She exhibits symptoms of being emotionally unstable.
--I'm not sure if this is related to BPD, but she is extremely paranoid. Some of her thoughts: " As I pull into the garage, I always have to look behind me as the garage door goes down so nobody slips in". "I can't leave my child at home while I go outside because someone's going to come in and kidnap her!" "I have to check the alarm system multiple times--what if a burglar turned it off?" 
--My mother often randomly remembers things that made her upset 20 years ago, both the big ones and the trivial ones. These memories will suddenly come back to her randomly, and she'll be extremely overemotional and full of rage (kicking, yelling, screaming, whining) for hours as if the event had repeated itself again. 
--She often overidealizes others, especially her close friend. She treats her close friend much better than she treats us, her own children. Each family secret or private, personal matter is told to that friend. Each thought, emotion, feeling is told to that friend. We have no privacy in our family anymore because everything is always told to that friend. If someone, even members of her own family, states something such as trivial as "Mom, why do you talk to her all the time?", she becomes very angry, starts screaming and yelling, and strictly defends that friend. 
--She has not attempted suicide, but sometimes does threaten to, though she never actually does it.
--She has had a problem with major anxiety in the past.
--She puts herself above others. My sister was recently accepted to an excellent, top-notch, one of the best high schools in the US (this school was in New England), but in order to attend, we would have to move...my mother's reasons for not moving were "it's too cold up there" "i don't like the weather" "i don't like the houses up there" and threw multiple fits day after day after day because of how she didn't want to move until finally, my sister had to decline the admission offer. 
--She can be verbally abusive.
