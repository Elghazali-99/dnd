I have been getting these tiny red spots called petechiae, but they have been around for like 5 months so I don't know if I should be  concerned for those. After research they aren't widespread like most of the pictures ive seen. they are confined to a small area at different parts of my body at different times like my side rib cage lower stomach and my inner thighs,they eventually go away.
  I also have pain in my upper elbow that's starting to get a little worse, that has been around for like 3 months .My right leg is smaller than the other and I get slight thigh discomfort. 
  I can still exercise with these things not getting in my way but ever since my grandma was diagnosed with leukemia AT JUST 59( the average age of cancer diagnosis is 66) I have been real conscious of my health. Althoguh it was a 2 years ago I still cant stop thinking about it. 
   I haven't had a fever 
 I haven't had any night sweats 
 I haven't had any swollen lymph nodes 
 I haven't had any loss of appetite 
 I haven't had any weight loss either
