My step daughter is an absolute nightmare recently. She lies and cries constantly, rattles on my 6 year old about every little thing. My 6 year old is well behaved ,by the way. She randomly runs into her room and cries and tells her dad that I tell her to go to her room, which I don't and he knows that. She's been hitting my son so now he doesn't want to play with her anymore. She absolutely refuses to potty train, I've tried everything and she won't budge. I watch her during the day while my husband is at work and most of the time she's fine all day until my husband or son get home from work/school then she starts her crying fits and literally acts like she gets beat all the time and has this shrill of a cry. If she's asked to pick up her room or finish her food or go to bed, she shakes like she's terrified and cries so hard shes hyperventilating. If I yell at her my husband accesses me of treating her like crap and that's why she does these things and also accuses me of treating our son better. I try to remind him that I don't yell at our son because he behaves but when my son does misbehave he does get punished so I don't understand that either. When I'm lenient with her she walks all over everyone and doesn't do what she's told. I'm the only mother she's known since she was a baby and her real mom is out of the picture so that's not the issue. I dont know how to deal with this anymore. It's too stressful. There's no talking to her because she just whines and acts like she's a baby that can't speak for herself or do anything at all for herself. I've suggested taking her to a child psychologist but my husband doesn't like the idea and tells me it's my fault and if I treated her better shed be fine.. but I love her like my own and treat her as if she was my real child.  Please help me I'm at my wits end with this child
