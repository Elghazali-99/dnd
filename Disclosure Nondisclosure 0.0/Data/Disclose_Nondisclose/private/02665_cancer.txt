I'll start this off saying I'm still a virgin and know that a doctor is always the best option for diagnosing problems so I don't hear it a thousand times in the reply's.
 Ok, so I've had this dark spot on my penis shaft about since I was 14, at the time I thought it was just a bruise but it never went away, it didn't hurt so I never did anything about it. During the same year I noticed my stomach skin begin to change color (half was darker than the other) I eventually self-diagnosed myself as having hyper pigmentation and figured that my penis problem was also hyper pigmentation. 
 I think possibly a year later I noticed small red bumps on the underside of the shaft of my penis, (less than 1mm) I can't tell if it's gotton worse over the year because I choose to ignore it like alot of idiots do. Around the same time I noticed a wart like growth near the other small bumps.
 Anyway now I'm 18 and have EVEN more dark spots on my penis, additional dark spots are on the shaft as well as the head, and my question to you is, do you think this is Penile Cancer? And if not then what is the problem?
 P.S. I'm Circumcised!.... but you can probably see that from the pictures ;)
 I know the pictures aren't the best quality but please do what you can with them.
