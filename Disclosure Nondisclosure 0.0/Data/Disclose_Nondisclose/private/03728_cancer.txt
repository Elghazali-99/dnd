I was recently in the hospital for chest pain with high blood pressure (7/20).  After having a chest CT, the results are below.  The hospitalist called them "incidental findings" and stated I needed to see my primary care asap.  I'm very concerned and hope someone can at least lend a little advice.
 CT angiography of chest with injection of Optiray, shows bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  There is no large confluent mass seen but the number of lymph nodes are slightly increased diffusely throughout the mediastinum.  There is calcified plaque in the aorta with noncalcified plaque also seen throughout the aorta, particularly along the decending aorta.  No dissection is identified.  No aneurysm is seen.  Heart size is normal.  Central pulmonary arteries are well-opacified.
 Lung window show diffuse septal thickening with pleural and subpleural thickening noted.  There is no consolidation or dominant lung mass seen. No pleural effusion is seen.  There is bronchial wall thickening throughout the lungs.  There is atelectasis in the lung bases with mild scarring in the lingual.
 Note:  I do have an echo and stress test scheduled for Wednesday.
 Any help translating would be greatly appreciated.
