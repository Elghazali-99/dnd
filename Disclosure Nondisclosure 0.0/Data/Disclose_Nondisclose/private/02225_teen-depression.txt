i'm normally a happy person, but of the last few months i've been developing depression. my grandad died last year and we were so close it still upsets me, and my mum and dad have been in the process of divorce for nearly 5 years now. they never speak, and my dad doesn't really care about me, doesn't invite me over much and i haven't slept at his house for nearly 3 years. he used to force me into things but now he doesn't bother with me and he's started to forget simple things about me because he rarely talks. it's been about 4 years since he told me he loved me. but other than that i feel so alone, my mum shouts at me a lot so i can't talk to her, and my brothers are adults now. i feel like i can't talk to my friends about it because some of my friends have problems that i see as worse than mine, and i'm worried they'd think i'm "attention seeking" if i opened up. so basically i have no one to talk to, and i'm begining to self harm which i know is bad but it just seems easier to take emotional pain away. i just feel like dying and like i'm worthless and i don't deserve a place on the earth, and i have no future. i'm crying now, partly because i'm upset but mostly because of how miserable i feel and worthless and i'm so confused and i don't know what to do. i've never spoke to anyone else with this, so i'd really apreciate anyone talking to me? i'm sorry if i've gone on a lot, i just feel the need to explain and i'm just so confused and don't understand life anymore, sometimes i just fantasize about dying to make it easier.
thankyou.
