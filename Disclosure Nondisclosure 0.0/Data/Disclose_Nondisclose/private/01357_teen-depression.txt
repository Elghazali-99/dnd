My daughters father has not talked to her since about this time last year.  He always told my daughter who is now 15 it was her job to call him and would often guilt trip her when she didn't.  Last year she called him on his birthday and he asked if he could call her back.  He still has not called back.  He refuses to call her.  I wrote him a letter a few months back explaining that this was straining their relationship and that she did have a desire to talk to him.  Through the grape vine she heard that her dad expects her to apologize for something....she has no idea what.  
 Recently her father's  girlfriend contacted her by email to say that she knows this is not her fault and doesn't understand why her dad won't call her.  
 Even though my daughter has put on a brave front...this really effects her.  After school on Wednesday I had a conversation with her and found out that she feels abandoned and rejected by her father.  She was very tearful and emotional the remainder of the evening.  I have tried numerous times to get her to talk, but it is difficult when she always says she is "fine" or "nothing is wrong"....I know that is typical for this age.  
 I want her to ask for help, but she feels bad when she does.  She is afraid to ask for help from males particularly and I think she avoids asking for help in fear that it will upset her.  I am at a loss as to what to do at this point and how to help her with this.  There is clearly a deep seeded fear in her of men in general which began in 5th grade when her male teacher was, well, less than encouraging towards her.  He often told her that her problem was she didn't WANT to do well in school.  Ever since then she has a real problem asking for help, especially from males even as harmless as they seem.  I would hate to see her continue on this path when it is clear that avoiding male teachers, bosses and men is not an option.
 Any advice or recommendations you have would be greatly appreciated.
