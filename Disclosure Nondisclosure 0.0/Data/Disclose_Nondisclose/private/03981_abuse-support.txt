My boyfriend gets really aggressive when he drinks but the last incident escalated to a new violent level. He is an amazing boyfriend when he doesn't drink and I love him so much. He has been aggressive in the past but not always but he gets into mindsets sometimes if one thing i say or do, even saying I want to go home will set his anger off and he will yell at me at the top of his lungs. Things were pretty good until his best friend got back who is a horrible influence on him and treats women like dirt. I refused to talk to him since the last time because I needed some time to think about what I want. Im afraid that the next time this happens it is just going to get continuously worse and every time he claims to not remember anything and says that he is so sorry and that he will make it up to me. I am turning 20 in a month and I can't decide if I want to stay with him because I love him or if I should break up with him because things are so serious as we are already talking marriage and kids. I want to go to medical school and travel and his protectiveness over me holds me back from doing the things I want to do because he doesn't approve. I can't tell if i am overreacting over this. I need some help and I want him to get some help too. what should i do?
