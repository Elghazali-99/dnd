I am a 29 year old female with history of crazy, destructive relationships, self-abuse, attachment and trust issues.  I had an unofficial diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder (case of leading the doc, I believe) but I never could explain things right to the doctor, and my mention of mood swings was enough for them to believe this was the case.  I grew up mainly in foster homes, and my mom was very abusive.  
 None of the treatments so far have helped me (low level of Neurontin, Alprazolam, Lamictal, Seroquel.)  I have a three year old and I am afraid that history is going to repeat itself.  I am constantly irritable, and show innappropriate anger in front of her (throwing things and yelling).  I also am emotionally distant at times.  I try so hard to control my emotions and am wracked with guilt when I cannot.  My daughter gets clingy with me now when I am upset and I think she doesn't know how I will react to things; sometimes I am fine, sometimes I get angry.  I have never hit her, or called her names, but I know my reactions are not right.  I am almost 100% positive that I have BPD, and that my mother has BPD.  I love my daughter so much and I want to be a good mother to her.  The thought that I have already caused emotional damage kills me.
 How do I get the care that I need for this?  I live in a rural area where the availablity of therapists, specialist and psychiatrists is very limited.  Is there a test for this disorder?  I don't want to seem like I am self-diagnosing, but I know that I'm not Bi-Polar.  I have been searching for an answer for years as to what may be the root of my problems and I think I've stumbled upon it.  I feel that there is no time to waste because I don't want to inflict any more emotional damage on my daughter.  What is the next step for me in order to ensure that I get the care that I need?
