I am just writing this as i am trying very hard to talk about things. This is actually my fisrt attempt to talk about it. Read my comments on my profile for previous statement that are connected to this one to understand.
 since my mom was not around much and may dad was pretty much caught up in his own little world, we ( 7 of us, 2 boys and 5 girls)were mostly left to make ends meet. I had to cook, clean, wash (by hand) and do all those stuff from I can remember myself. My sieters except for my twin were mostly high school dropouts so while they were away trying to put food on the table for their children, my sister(twin) and I had to be their children's mother. It was really hard because we never seemed to get a break. 
 Then sometimes when the others were away my sister and I would be left alone with the smaller ones. That is when our cousins would come over and molest us. We knew what they were doing was wrong but we could not say a word because we were afraid of our own family. 
 Our older sisters lived on their own and sometimes one of them would ask us to come and stay over to look after her children. At nights when she was not around, here comes our step brother to do the same. We could not tell her because she is a very agressive person. Frankly i was more concerned about what she would do to me if she found out. I still am. I cannot go anyfurther just now, it is just too hard ro talk about.
