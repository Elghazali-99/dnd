Hi, 
 I am posting this for my Mother who is 59 years old. She has been having burning sensation in her feet since last 2 years. Almost 4 months back, burning sensation did spread acorss the body and severity of the burning sensation has increased a lot. We did consults many doctors including general physicians, gastro interologist, neuro physician and now a psychiatrist. All her reports (ECG, Thyroid, Vit B12, Vit D3, Angiography, 2D echo, ANA Blot) - are normal. She was detected with a diabetes a month ago. 5 years back, she has was treated for a breast cancer - operation followed by chemo therapy and radio therapy - Cancer surgeon says she is out of cancel now after periodic follow ups. Neuro physician has ruled our neuropathy saying that her reflexes in the legs are good enough.
 Currently we are consulting a psychiatrist and she is on following medicines since last 13 days. 
Serlift 50MG and Tryptomer 25MG - after 13 days her condition has not changed and she is feeling severe burning sensation. Especially on hot day. She suddenly feels cold as well. 
 Need your help/advise as she is going through painful burning senssation that makes her restless all the time. She is not able to sleep as well.
