Knew this guy through dating website. Went out ok for first date. 3rd times date, he told me that he has illness..and explain what is that and ask me to ask him if there is anything that i do not understand.. subsequently i told him that it is very difficult for me to accept him... we went to same temple.
 He has not done wrong. and he is a nice guy. there is no reason i have to dump him. As time goes by, we went out as normal friend after temple and some of the weekend. unrealising... i feel we are getting closer...however, everytime i will tell him that 'We are just friend' so that he dont put his hope that i will be his one day. in case,, things dont work, at least it wont depress him and make his illness get worst... 
 i am very confuse and concern about the future...my friend ask me to seek advise from his doctor to know more on his condition, whether will relapse, about marriage if he is fit and able to cope with the marriage stress.. whether doctor advise marriage for him as i think he needs someone to take care of him more thatn he take care of others... 
 i know he always try to make me happy but i just couldnt be myself as i do not have the answer.. i also reluctant to meet his parents and family member as i do not want to disspoint him if anything not work out... 
 please advise and help me... what should i do... my brother and sister advise me to look for other guy... 
i think he is a very nice guy...i really do not know what to do ... my friends discourage too... please help
