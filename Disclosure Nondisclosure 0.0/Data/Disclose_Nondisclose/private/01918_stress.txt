A week ago I started getting these palpitations. They happened in bed before I went to sleep. I would be feeling stressed, then I would feel a small thump in my chest.  The first time this happened I put my fingers on my heart, and when it happened again I felt my heart beat twice fast. I has only been happening when I am stressed in bed, sometimes once during the day. I get up to 3 in a row, and then my heart goes back to normal, but usually 1.
 I've had an ecocardigram for other stress related symtoms (as the doctor found an innocent heart murmur during a check up, which I read innocent means harmless, and I was stressed during that time, which can cause them) a chest x ray and blood test. All have come up positive for no problems.
 Yesterday I was feeling really stressed as I was going for my ecocardigram. When I got back home I felt it happen, I couldn't stop thinking about it, and it happened again about 10 minutes later and again about an hour later. I'm not sure if I was making it up or not. Sometimes my brain makes up a pain or other stuff somewhere on my body when I am stressed.
 I read that this is a kind of palpitations, is that right? Or is it arrhythmia? When it happens (unless I am making it up) it only does it up to three times then goes back to normal, usually 1. It doesn't come with any other symptoms. I heard that if it happens for up to 2 minutes with symptoms it can suggest an underlying problem.
 What I want to make sure is that it is a normal thing of/during stress and that it does no harm my heart in the long term (remembering I have no heart problems.) I read 'Occasional palpitations during periods of emotional or physical stress are normal and are nothing to worry about' What would be the difference between occasional and frequent or persistent?
 I'm going to stress management soon, and in the meantime will try not to think about it.
