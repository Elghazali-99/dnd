hi,
 few ADs work for me.  Prozac is mediocre even at 80-120 mg/day.  Parnate is the best but I am on Prozac (fluoxetine, really) and I would never be able to withstand the 5 to 6-week Prozac-to-MAOI washout.  I have taken Vivactil (protriptyline) in the past and it had some beneficial effects.  I liked the quick energy boost; you take it when you wake up, for instance, and it helps separate "sleep-time" from "wakefulness-time" in a non habit-forming way.  It also worked pretty quickly.  I was in the 40-60 mg/day range.  It sure was difficult to wear contact lenses with Vivactil and it dries your eyes out severely, but there's always eye drops for that.  I've taken several TCAs in the past and there's always been the issue of constipation, but that can be helped with a big bowl of bran every breakfast religiouslly (usually).  
 I think I'd like to make the switch from this effete, ersatz, generic fluoxetine 80 mg/day to Vivactil (brand only, not the generic protriptyline), because the change can take place almost as once -- no washout periods to disable my functioning completely that I have read about, yet.
 I was just wondering if anyone felt like posting how they extol the virtues of Vivactil -- good experiences, troubles, complications, or even people who hated it!  There is not a ton of data on the web re: Vivactil, so first-hand reports from nice folks like you may help me (and my p-doc, of course) make a good decision.
 THANKS
