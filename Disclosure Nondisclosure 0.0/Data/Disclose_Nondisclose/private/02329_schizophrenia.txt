I have diabetes. And high blood pressure. In the past 3 months Ive lost 65 pounds on my doctors recommendation to go on a liquid diet of Boost Glucose Bkfst/lunch/dinner and bedtime. then recently a salad at lunch meal only plus still taking the Boost. Because of the weight loss my diabetic oral meds were discontinued and my bp meds were lowered so the fat loss did improve my health. Im also schizophrenic and taking a low dose of quetiapine (seroquel) 300 MG AT 9pm daily. My endocrinologist ordered 200units injection every 2 weeks injection but my psychiatrists says No dont do it. What should I do?
 Ive read so many opinions online - some MDs say take the testosterone and some MDs say dont take the testosterone! 
Also I see so many testosterone supplements saying take ours - Have increased energy - high sex drive - stonger erections - increased muscle mass - more energy for $80 a month sold at GNC and other health stores. . My endocrinologist said absolutely forget that hype from GNC.
