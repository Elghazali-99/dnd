In short:
Smoked weed with a couple of friends,repeated 3-4 times,got depersonalization and anhedonia 4th time,went to doctor,he said he won't tell my parents,he sent me to a psychiatrist,seeing him in a couple of weeks.
 I want to know what's wrong with me.Here's a list of symptoms:
-Anhedonia
-Depersonalization
-Emotionless
-Time goes by fast
-Bad memory
-Almost no concentration
....
 Before this I was a fun guy.I enjoyed nature and everything.Now life is boring.
When I smoked weed I started getting real depersonalized(I didn't know it back then).I was feeling awful.I first started laughing then I started to feel real sad.I asked my friend why I was feeling sad but he didn't reply.Now when I got worse and worse he started making fun of me.He thought I was high and I was joking around.He started saying how he's a bird and how he's gonna jump of a cliff or something.I gathered up the strength and stood up holding him.I didn't think so everything I heard was real to me.After that he started saying how I'm in a coma and that we're in the future or some crap.That experience traumatized me.Especially because of my friend.
 Well,I was feeling ok a couple of days ago.I didn't feel emotions,still felt depersonalized but there was a balance.A couple of days ago I was going to the bakery with the same friend that I smoked weed with.He started talking and I suddenly started feeling 100% depersonalized again.I don't know what caused this.It just happened.My balance was ruined.We went to the bakery every day on recess but it was the first time that happened.
 Now every time I talk with him alone I start feeling as bad as I did before.
 Why did this happen?
Will I recover?
Will the psychiatrist tell my parents that I smoked weed?
What's wrong with me?
