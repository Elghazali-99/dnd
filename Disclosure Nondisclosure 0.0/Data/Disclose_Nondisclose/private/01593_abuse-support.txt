I really need some advice. I am a 33 year old happily married mother of five wonderful children, 4 boys and my youngest, one of twins, is a girl. When I was quite young, before I was a teenager, I was molested by my father's brother. After a few years of silence I finally got up enough courage to tell my father. When I told him what had happened, he walked away from me without saying a word. To this day, he has never brought it up and I certainly never did again, either. After many hard years I was able to come to terms with myself and got married and started a family of my own. Since I've had a daughter, however, I have been plagued with bouts of anxiety and panic, and many days, the trauma of my youth haunts me until I am in tears. I just can not seem to get past it again. My children have noticed a difference in me and so has my husband. I've talked to my husband about what is wrong with me. He suggested that I talk to a counselor, however, I have never, ever, told anyone exactly what had been done to me and I know the words will never come out of my mouth. I don't know what to do. How can I leave the past behind me where it belongs?
