Hi. I don't really know what to say, but I find it easier to talk to strangers than to the people close to me. I've recently been through a lot of changes in my life, which I'm not very good at coping with. Often times when going through something like this I can talk to my best friend. But these days she's at a different school and is capable of replacing me and everyone else. When I told her, I broke down, I often keep **** in because it takes a long time for me to talk about myself. She promised not to forget about me, but she did. I'm in the process of letting her go, I've deleted every photo, text, and whatever else reminds me of her, but now I know I'm truly alone. I can't tell my parents that I have depression or any of my new friends. It's going to take years for me to be able to open up and trust them, and I'm afraid that in that time period I'll be dead. Sometimes I imagine killing myself and blaming it all on her just to show her how much she betrayed me. She went through the same things, but I was always there, sometimes too much, but I made sure she was okay. And now I'm here, and she's not and will never be and Im so angry and alone and literally have no one to talk to. And my condition is getting rapidly worse. I don't know what to do.
