Hello kind people.  I'm a 34 year old female from Florida.  I've been diagnosed with Borderline in the past.  Also, I was treated for Bipolar disorder about 15 years ago (but I think I was misdiagnosed).   I took meds before, been hospitalized, lots of therapy, etc.  I've been doing really well though on my own and am not seeking any sort of treatment...no meds or therapy.   I am not depressed & have not cut myself in a year (until now).   Anyway, I don't know what disorder I have, if any really...personally, I don't think I have a mental illness whatsoever.  I want to cut bad, not because I'm depressed or stressed.  I want to cut for spiritual reasons.  I want to cut because I operate on a high vibration spiritually so cutting "grounds" me & makes me human.  Anyway, should I talk to my doctor about this?  Sorry for asking this stupid question.  I'm a little confused & I was doing so well & I really don't think I have an illness.  I'm just afraid my doctor will have me involuntarily committed.  Thank you.
