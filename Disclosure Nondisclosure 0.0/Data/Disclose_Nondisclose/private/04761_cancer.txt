I got my CBC results back and i am very concerned.
 6 weeks ago a had a what was described by doctors as a low risk hiv exposure. I have been tested every week and I'm getting -ve results. I was also tested positive for CMV IGG and HSV 1 IGG. I have been getting some joint and bone pain with some pain in the groin nodes but that all disappeared after a week. I had a random CBC and the results are confusing. Please Help. I also want to add that I took the blood test while on Augmentin 1,000. 
Please tell me if I should be concerned.
