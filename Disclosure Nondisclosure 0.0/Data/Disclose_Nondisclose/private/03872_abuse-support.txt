Hi  everyone,
 My husband really insist on helping a girl in an abusive relationship. We have really tried. Everything that we could do has been done. I have told my husband that after a certain point, she has to make a decision herself. No one will be able to help her unless she wants to change the situation- I can see it now: We will move the world for her  and she  will still stay with her abusive boyfriend.
 As you all know there are cycles of abuse. We have seen this girl through at least 3 cycles. Now she and her boyfriend are in the honeymoon phase. This girl has already said that she wants to stay with this abusive guy.Now she is even acting resentful to my husbands efforts. He called her and she said  "I'm going to stay with him until I am not in love with him anymore". As if...
 I am honestly tired of all of this. I believe that our efforts are useless as long as she does not make a decision to change. It seems, that sense my husband want so bad to help, I must wait until he gets tired too.  However, I see that he is getting hurt in the process too: he smokes more ( he was planning to quit, but is so stressed by this situation and hasn't yet), he, initially, was not honest with me about his involvement in this situation (secrete emails and etc); He is constantly thinking about this girl's situation and neglecting his responsibilities. 
 There is so much information about helping an abusive person, but are there any links about how helping an abusive person can negatively affect your life? If so , I NEED THOSE LINKS!!!!
 Thanks Everyone
