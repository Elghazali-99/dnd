Hi I am 39 and have been diagnosed with BPD and biolar. Both of my children 16 yr old daughter and 14 yr old son exhibit all of these traits. I have sought help for them in the past but they basically either refuse to talk to the therapist /when they find one they like the therapist leaves the clinic. I am seeking help at another clinic now but in the meantime my son who is 14... has been on Prozac 20mg for over a yr. He mentioned about 3 wks ago that he was hearing a voice but could not tell me what it said. A few days ago he told me this again. He said the voice sounds like a demon and it is telling him to hurt himself and others. I took him to a mental health ER on Wed. He saw a nurse, a therrapist and a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist upped his Prozac to 40mg. He also said that males at this age who have depression symptoms sometimes experience this. He started the 40mg Prozac on Thurs. morning and says the voices are more frequent. Does any one have any suggestions or know how long we should wait for the Prozac to "work". He has an appointment with a therapist on Wed. This is really troubling him as well as me. I only want the best for both of my children
