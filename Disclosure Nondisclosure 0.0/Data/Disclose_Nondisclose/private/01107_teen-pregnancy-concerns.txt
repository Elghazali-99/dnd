me and my boyfriend had sex during the night between friday to saturday,he wore a condom but it broke. 
my boyfriend says he thinks the condom broke a few minutes before we stopped having sex because he felt like it was more pleasnt
so he came in me one time according to what he said. (he came 3 times overall) when he took his **** out we saw that the condom was broke 
all the way,and i had his *** all over my thighs, i immediately ran and cleaned it off  but he definitely came in me, and i think it happend at 1 am.
the next days we went to the pharmacy and bought the morning after pill and then i ate somthing and swallowed the pill at about 3:30 pm. (which is
14 and a half hours after he came in me) 
i got my last period at June 23.
what are my odds to get pregnant? i'm really stressed about it,i'm only 18 and the last thing i need right now is to get pregnant.
i will definitely start to take birth control pills just to make sure i won't be facing this situation again. 
so how likely i am to get pregnant? 
 btw if the accident happend one hour after middnight between friday to saturday which means between 12-13 july,what day should count as the day of the accident? 
the 12th or the 13th?
 thanks in advanced.
