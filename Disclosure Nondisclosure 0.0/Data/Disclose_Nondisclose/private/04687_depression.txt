I have been recently diagnosed with ADHD, I have been on a myriad of meds for bipolar which have never worked.  I have been given Adderall the first day 5 mg had put in a chair eyes closed calm as a cucumber, I don't think I have ever not been on edge in my life. Taking 5mg twice a day the first day I was surprised at my focus and my racing obsessive thoughts were gone, yeah!  Problem, simple everyday tasks, chores are impossible.  I could sit all day.  I have adjusted doses taking more and taking less.  Zombie.  I see this a lot on the internet but NEVER see anyone say what they did.  "ask your DR" isn't so easy for some of us.  I had wonderful insurance , this last depression has left this once successful person w/ little.  I am in an area now where the Psyc. are few and their visits are 15min and 3 months apart and it is better to come in with suggestions than just problems. I do have a therapist but she is not versed on meds at all. I am in despair.  I could use some help.
