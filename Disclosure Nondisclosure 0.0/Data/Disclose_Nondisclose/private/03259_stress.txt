I'm 18 years old - female; I'm 5'7" and 122lbs. I live an extremely busy life. I go to school about 30 hours a week, and I work about 12-17 hours/week. I'm never home, I never see my family anymore, I don't get much sleep and I don't eat properly because of my busy schedule. 
 For the past few weeks, I really haven't been feeling good. I'm nauseas everyday, usually dizzy as well, I get spacey at times, my memory is horrible, I get blackouts, and heart palpitations (I'm wearing a monitor for 3 weeks). Because of my busy schedule, I rarely have time to eat, I usually just grab something on the go. And when I do get the chance to eat a nice meal, I can only eat a little bit because I get full so fast, and I start to feel even more nauseas afterwards. I'm tired all the time - one week I was getting less than 5 hours/sleep/night. I'm freezing all the time too (I used to be the hot one always wearing shorts).
 So I don't know if I've been feeling sick from a combo of this heavy schedule/not eating right/not sleeping right or if something else is going on? I've been getting mad lately just because I'm so busy I have absolutely no time for myself and when I do get the chance to go out with my friends, my mom is constantly calling me because I scared her one day saying I got into a bad situation so now she has to know where I am every minute of everyday. I was thinking of taking myself to a free clinic (if I can find one) and just getting everything checked out. Advice?
