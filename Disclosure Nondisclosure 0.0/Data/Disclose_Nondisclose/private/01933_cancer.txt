I hope everyone is doing well here and I do apologize I have not been diagnosed with cancer. I've been having trouble the past six months and just need some insight or advice.  In December I noticed a enlarged groin node in the crease of my right thigh.  Went to my doctor and she said it was of no concern, but sent me to an oncologist to double check. He diagnosed me with inguinal lymphadenopathy and said to return in 8 weeks for any significant changes. He was not concerned and said it was small(1-1.5cm). The lymph node does not cause pain, but there is pain in the surrounding areas. The pain is like a constant pressure in my pubic area on the right side that radiates to my thigh and hip. The pressure is worse when I wear a belt, but is is always there. Also in the exact spot that most of the pressure comes from (right pubic area) there is a slight bulge. It fluxuates in size through out the day. Sometimes almost completely flat and other times more noticeable. It feels like the pubic muscle but the left side is completely flat with no pain or pressure. I have had blood test, urine test, and a abdominal CT. If there was a mass I'm sure the CT would have seen it, but the pain and pressure has not gone away. I'm not sure what is going on and it's caused me allot of distress. I've lost 40 pounds over the last six months, hair seems to be falling out,can't sleep or eat. I hope and believe the weight loss is due to stress. I don't no if the pain is from my intestines or the node is sitting on nerves? I do go back to the oncologist next week so if there are any test I should request please share. Any advice or input would help. The only cancers I could find even close to my symptoms are lymphoma or intestinal. I'm 27 6ft 160 pound male. Thanks again and have a great day
