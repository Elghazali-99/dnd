there never seems to be a right time to die. i cant see a future for myself and i know in my heart ill never amount to anything. Im a 16yr old girl and im just stuck. my mum thinks im fine because 'theres nothig wrong with you girl, you smile and laugh all the time'. obviously every laugh i do HAS to be genuine. she wont let me see a doctor. i went to see one a while ago and he wouldnt help and im so ashamed and embarrassed that i dont want to go back. i spend most of my time thinking about how i would kill myself, im really not fussy. then all of a sudden, as im doing something, ill get a massive urge to just die. just go and down all the pullss i can see and vodka and just die. but then i get angry cause im not pretty enough to die yet, when i die im going to do my makeup really nice. i cant die until im pretty, and i dont think i will ever be. so why do i get these random urges, like i daydream about killing for most of the day, so thats being 'suicidal', right? so what the hell are these urges all about? maybe im just double suicidal
