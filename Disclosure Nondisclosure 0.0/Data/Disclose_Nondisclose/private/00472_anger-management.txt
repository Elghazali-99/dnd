Sir,    i am a 23 year old engineering student.My life has become teribly worse because of my anger problem.I tend to get angry on small things.I try to control myself but than somehow i get so angry that i feel blood rushing through my head and i feel like throwing away things.for e.g if im on a phone talking with someone and i get angry i throw away my phone without even thinking how costly it is.This has made my life totally terrible because of this my girlfriend has broken up with me.   Also i have memory problem where i cannot remember things and tend to forget them in a min.E.g if i had lunch and than someone after half an hour or so asks me what had for lunch im blank for few min or sometime i just cannot recollect.It has become so worse that sometimes even while talking with someone i forget what i was talking about and i have to think what i was talking about.Sometimes i leave my bag at home and go to college.People tell me that this happens coz i tend to remember things only that i want to.But this is not so i try to memorize but i just cant.I was an excellent student during my school time and now a days learning new subject is a problem.i have to read it over and over again to memorize and still get blank at time.  Please help me with this sir.
