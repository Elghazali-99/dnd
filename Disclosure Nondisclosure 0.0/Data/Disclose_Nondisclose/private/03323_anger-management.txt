HiI find myself very hard to contain my anger. Unfortunately i am now taking if out on my partner. She has done no wrong but i lash out and beat her to the extent that she has been taken to hospital on numerous occasions. I have been arrested twice for domestic violence and the PSNI offered her self defence help, and have her on the high risk register because she is at a high risk of being assaulted by me. I am ashamed to admit it but i need help, i cant keep hurting her like this. I have cracked her ribs, gave her numerous black eyes, very bad bruises, nose bleeds, iv hidden her inhaler so as she takes an asthma attack in which she then needs hospital help. She is everything i want from life but i cant keep hitting her and abusing her. She has now thrown me out but i want to show her i can change and stop this anger. Is there anything i can do to stop all this? Please contact me via telephone on ***********. (If i dont answer please feel free to send me a text message) Many thanks i need help to beat this but unfortunately am unable to use the internet all the time! Please help me
