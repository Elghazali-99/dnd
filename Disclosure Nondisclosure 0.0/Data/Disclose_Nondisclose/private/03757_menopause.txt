I may or may not be going through peri-menopause, and was wondering if any of you wise women would care to share your experiences?
 I'm especially interested in your unusual or uncommon symptoms.  You see, there is something wrong with me, but because it involves so many bodily systems, everyone is baffled.  It has been suggested I may be in peri-menopause, even though not a single doctor will even entertain the thought. (I'm 47 and otherwise very healthy.)
 I don't have any of the common peri-menopause symptoms, but it is said that my PCOS can cause that.
 Of the symptoms I've read, I can only say I sometimes have "burning mouth" and I may have had one "hot flash" (but just one).  My periods are more and more regular, month after month, going from 1-3 times/year, to now every 27-31 days.  (PCOS usually means irregular periods, but is said to cause periods to become more regular during peri- menopause.)
 So, tell me...  What did YOU experience?  Was it pretty much what you expected, or were you surprised?  Any PCOS women who've gone through menopause?  Thanks!
