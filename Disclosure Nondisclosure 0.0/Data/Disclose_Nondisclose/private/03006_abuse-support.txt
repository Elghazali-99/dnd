I have this boyfriend whom I love dearly. In the beginning of our relationship, he lavished gifts on me, was super sweet and made me feel like an all around princess. In return, I wanted to give him the world. Lately, things have been changing quite a bit. I don't see that "would do anything for me" attitude anymore. No matter what the situation, he is always trying to act like he did nothing wrong. He says it is always me. One night, we got into a fight and he said he wanted to kick my teeth down my throat and then kill me by cutting my throat. Within seconds, he has apologized and was trying to kiss my tears away. I left him but forgave him shortly after. Recently things have not been so blatant. he has always called me names. He claimes I promiscuous. That is the nicest way I can say it. He uses terrible words. Any time we are in an arguement he calls me names. A couple of weekends ago, he told me that the only prerequisit to be with me is to have a penis. I have been reading up on the internet a little about some of this. It says that even neglect is a form of abuse. He will often times not call me or return my texts and I will call and text and beg him back because I am afraid he does not love me anymore. He will ignore me until he is ready to let me back in. Often times, I have not done much to deserve this behavior. It breaks my heart every time because I love him, and  he won't even return my calls. Then, once he does, I am so grateful that I forget that the fight began with his misdoings. He does what he wants with no consequences. He doesn't seem to have much feeling about hurting others. He is a criminal and did two years in the pen. My question is, is this verbal or emotional abuse or am I making tooo much of it. I am not the easiest person to get along with sometimes and I do irritate him a lot lately.
