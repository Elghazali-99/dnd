hi all, I'm a husband and dad of a 5 y/o girl. I've been with my wife for ten years. in that time it's been a roller coaster with a lot of anger on both sides. I've recently seen my drinking as a major catalyst and I've stopped. the relationship is now a Mexican standoff. it's imperative that I stay calm, even when my wife screams at me. I've made every effort to stay calm in the past when I'm being yelled at but at times I've snapped and gone into a rage. it's never been physical as such, but I have scared myself and my family. my wife is now scared. we both want 'normal' back but the defensive cycle on both sides has carried things on. I don't know how to reverse us out of this situation now and I'm genuinely scared of my reactions, even when I make every attempt to stay calm. I can't change her anger toward me, I can only change how I react. there have been times when the switch finally 'flicks' when I say and do things I've been helpless to prevent with adrenalin and in a 'fight or flight' state. no man wishes for his wife to be fearful of him. no one intends this when getting married to the partner he loves. I'm at a loss for what to do. I'm just making every effort to remain calm at all costs. I hope there is light at the end of the tunnel because leaving my family has never been and option to me, I want to support them and find calm and happy balance. any stories are most welcome...
