The last 3 months..
  I had my last implant removed late June after having it for 7 years. Me and my fianc√© are trying for a baby. Since the removal of my implant I have had random bleeds that last for 2-3 days. My cycle is on or around the 24th of every month.. my first 2-3 day bleed was on the 17th then my next was on the 2nd and most recent on the 10th of the following month. It starts heavy like a normal period with slight cramps but then really light to almost a pinky colour the following days. This last time the cramps were really strong causing lower back ache and a restless night. My partner and I are getting slightly worried about this bleeding. Most people put it down to pregnancy but about 16 pregnancy test over the past 3 months have all came out negative. I'm really quite worried as this is completely unnatural for my body and cycle. I need answers and to be guided in the correct direction. I have been sick 2ce in the last 3 month and felt nauseous in the mornings but very rarely only when the bleeding seems to occur. Please can someone help with some answers as I'm quite worried now.
