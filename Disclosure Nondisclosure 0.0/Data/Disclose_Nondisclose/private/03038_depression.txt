Hi , I'm a 13 year old girl and I'm in Year 8 at high school. In primary, when I was around my rlly 3 close friends, I was quiet and was actually loud. I did walk in a wierd way, and the kids in my class always said horrible things, but I was never like this. By "this", I mean awkward. I stay at home most of the time, so the only time when I really go out is for school. But, it's been hell this year. In class,  feel do insecure, like "i probably look so wierd". I always keep my hand together, even when I'm walking, and I literally find it difficult to move my arms. Ppl have said "i look like a robot'. It worse than this, I always make a stupid face. Especially when the teacher is talking, and everyone's just quietly sitting down, looking around, all I can think is when will this lesson end. I actually have to tell myself where to look, what to do with my hands, etc. It's just horrible. If I wasn't like this I could make so more friends and concentrate in class. I dread some of my lessons, because I sit near these boys who imitate me, and make fun of me.It's far worse than I've described. It would take me about 10 pages to fully explain. I've been told to ignore these boys, and that there just jerks, and I try to. But what really stings is why do I have to go through this? Why do I have to worry about who I'm sitting near? Why am I awkward? In the past, I've had some serious issues, like low self esteem. I've finally gotten over that, an I love myself, but now I'm like this Is that why I'm like this? Can I fix this myself, or should I see a councellor. Sorry this was so long, an thank you ever so much fof reading it. :)
