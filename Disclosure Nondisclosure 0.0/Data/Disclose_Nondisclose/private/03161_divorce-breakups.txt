Hello my name is red and been with my girl friend for almost 3 years, we have a beautiful 21 week old son and the relationship was good, now in the relationship i did have my own flaws which i took full responcesibility for such as gambling and being to much of a nice guy, we have had arguments in the past because my ex has a previous history of cheating, anyone in the right mind understands that everyone is entitled to a second chance. In the first year we was together my ex got a job at a sign company and working with males and over a period of time things were not quite adding up, such as a guilty look by her and being very quiet, obviously shes been work and i was to and were tired so its rest time, but this was different.
I did eventually forget it as she always said i love you your my soul mate and i will never leave you.
We planned to have a baby but the first time round we suffered a miscarriage and i had to be so strong for her as she has always had a kidney problem and water infections and i was always there for her, by her bed side in hospital and making sure she didnt die in my arms, im getting quite upset writing this but it needs to be done.
I love her with all my heart and still do, now time went on my gambling got worse because my previos partner got me arrested by the police on false allegations, i lost my granparents a month apart and my own parents split of marriage after 38 years, anxiety kicked in and depression, well speaking of depression my exs family were quite negative people and it seemed as if imwas soaking it all up.
Now were here in december 2014 and my ex decided to go out on halloween, she text me sayin hi babes i will let you no when i am home safe as she lives at her parents, i called her back and said ok huni have fun and enjoy yourself knowing she was out with the girls, but she wasnt she was outmwith old work male friends and she lied to me, i had no call or message from her, i called her the following morning, she sounded terrible and i was a bit mad cuz she never let me no, she then said you always get the arse when i go out and put the phone down on me, i never heard from her again for four days. I eventually got a message from her saying, im sorry but i cant keep tourchering myself like i have done for months and were over.
I was just gob smacked prior to having a gut feeling for weeks something wasnt right, im sure she did cheat on me and trying to see my own son is a joke, i have to do everything on her terms and i am not doing it,cshe dumped me and crushed me abit, im feeling better now but got a tore ligament in my right leg so i cant really do much and she refuses to come to mine as she says i dont like your place it has a atpnosphere to it.
Charming i thought after everything i did for her and the creeps i have defended her from at her work place trying to get into her pants.
I did go to the inlaws the odd time but i tell u what there is a negative apnosphere there and i feel like i have a paranoia to my own son, my ex has just come back from blackpool and obviously my dad has a connection with her as she has his grandson so thats understandable and she said tell red i want my stuff on saturday and the new cott that i have or my relative will go to his threaten him and get it back, she did not no i was there and i heard everything, i did laugh, i am a body buider and ex martial artist, i do not even no this relative of hers and he sounds a right prick, she also said that he brought the cott knowing full well he ripped off a catalogue to get loads of baby things, i thought you can take it, it is tainted to me etc.
I have now decided to cut all contact with my ex and my son as in my mind that is the right thing to do, i feel like im being pulled from pilla to post but i am very strong minded and shes starting her mind games.
If anyone can give me advice then it,would be appreciated.
