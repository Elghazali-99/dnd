Hi, I'm 54, two years without a period. 6 weeks ago, out of nowhere I had a strong feeling of needing to pee.  I did but the feeling never went away. Had 10 days of feeling I had to pee every second of the day. Since then I have had some relief, sometimes only 5-10 minutes before I feel I need to go again, sometime I will get a few hours of relief. I have no burning, itching, pain or feeling like I can't make it to bathroom in time, just the feeling of always needing to go, day and night. I pee a lot at night, 5-6 times, no idea where all the liquid us coming from! Have had a lower abdominal ct scan, bladder scan and cystoscopy. All fine. Several urinalysis and cultures all negative. Dr has put me on oxybutinin and sending me to pelvic floor therapy. Wondering if this could be from menopause. Dr said everything looked fine with pelvic exam.  I did have two foot surgeries recently so was sitting around and using a knee scooter but have been up and walking for several weeks before this started. Any thoughts? Thanks
