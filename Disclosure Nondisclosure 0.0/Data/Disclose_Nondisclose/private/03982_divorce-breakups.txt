I have come to understand this topic more (seriously now) than I ever want to know because my husband is one of those men who, all of a sudden after some stray unannounced go away vacation, came home to tell me he is no longer in love with me and finds me unlovable and repulsive. His cold reptile-like treatment left me feeling used, neglected, abandoned and ashamed for being ignorant of his needs. But, my question is, if he's not affirmed the various ways or things I do or do not do that creates loving affections for me, how does he expect me to be warm and lovable in his eyes? He blames that if I don't know what makes him happy or how to make him happy by now (15 yrs+) then I'll never know! When I ask sincerely wanting to change, he refers me to go read a book. He's leaving me and the 4 boys because he & I are not compatible, I don't bring out the best in him, saying my weakness, which  he describes as flaws, dishonors him etc etc. Am I to believe him thinking I failed in the marriage -and rebirth a new me/change- or I stand firm on the notion that he's the one who quit on the marriage?! Shape up or ship out! Once a cheater, always a cheater and no second guessing a loser when you meet one?
