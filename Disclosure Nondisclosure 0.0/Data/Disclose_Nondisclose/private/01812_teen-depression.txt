I just turned 15 and I need help. I want a shoulder to cry on. I have had a bad run of life because of my parents. My dad cheated and stole all our stuff when I was 2 and my mom remarried. my sis has tried to kill me 4 times and my mom makes me do all the chores: sweeping and mopping, vaccuuming, dishes, and taking care of my now 11 month bro. My sis has an attitude every day which ends with me getting hurt. She's now 12 years old and acts like a toddler. And on top of it, no one knows i'm depressed. I tried to tell my mom but she got one of her tempers and said I only wanted attention. I've nearly ran away more than 10 times and thought of suicide countless more times. Talking to one of my friends helps, and I tried a therapist my stepdad took me to before he and my mom divorced and it helped a little. But what I really need is for my family to listen and support me but my mom's too uncaring and downputting and her bf is busy at work. Someone please help! I'm lost in a maze of life and the birds ate my bread crumb trail. I don't know what to do...
