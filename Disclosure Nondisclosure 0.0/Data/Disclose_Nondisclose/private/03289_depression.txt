i had a wonderful thanksgiving my kids from houston came up and she did the cooking the food was delicious.  everytime they ate she made me eat.  she even vacuumed and cleaned the house.  she has turned out to be a great wife to be and and wonderful mom. the 7 year old stayed near me the whole time.  he said he loved me more than anything in the world.  he said he got yelled at a lot for things he did not do.  he was going back into the living room.  i said come here.  he said yes and i said i found you another stupid games called stupid zombies.  itis greart he loved. made him forget his problems.  but now i am exhausted my pills are no way near working.  i guess i am tired tammy slept all day and worked all night.  she did eat thanksgiving dinner with us. but went back to bed.  they did not get to see her much.  but they love her and understand her problem.  with a 11 monthold baby and a 7 year old there is no keeping them quiet.  hope you all had a wonderful thanksgiving.  mandy876
