Well I am a mess, I was diagnosed with Major Depression, Anxiety, PTSD at CMH in November of 2012. I have had three therapists, the first one I asked for a replacement as she just kept sending me home with literature to read . The second one was great we connected and I saw her 3 times. Then CMH calls me to say she is ill and will call the reschedule my appointment. I do not hear from her Nov, Dec, Jan 2013. Then she sends a letter she is no longer a therapist she had gotten a promotion. So then there was no therapist until April 2014 so then I get my new therapist. A young man fresh out of college. He tells me that at my next review that my PTSD will be gone. Then he tells me I am Bi Polar 1 and that I am on the wrong medication. At my last session he told me that Mental Health is a farce and he believes we make the choice to be sad or to buck up and face our problems. He also told me I will not need medication in the future. I will see the physicist in July. Hopefully then I will know what is going on with me. 
 I am not choosing to be this way...before the SSRI I cried 24/7 for a year. I could not pull myself together. Then at first the SSRI made me sleep alot the doctor started me at 50mg and then raised me up to 100mg. I went from depressed to the opposite, crazy energy, thoughts racing, could not sleep. Now I bounce back and forth between the sad me and the hyperactive I can do anything me. I am on a crazy rollercoaster ride. Oh and me DR. a MD now has me on 200mg as my drug is supposed to cure everything. I have not been myself since 2010 reached out for help in 2012 and now it is 2014 and I have no idea what is going on with my mind.
