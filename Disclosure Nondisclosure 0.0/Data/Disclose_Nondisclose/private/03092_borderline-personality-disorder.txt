I have recently discovered that I have a serious problem with making other people happy, I know that sounds odd but but I have a 3 year old girl and a 7 month old baby girl, and a fiance that I love more then life.  Well all three I love more then life, I'm only 22 years old, and I discovered last night that I do everything for them, that I bend over backwards to make them happy, and do nothing for myself, I don't go anywhere unless its somewhere like Lowes when my fiance asks me to go with him, or to the park when my 3 year old wants to go play.  I cant tell you the last time I did something for myself.  I sometimes go all day without eating because I'm trying to do stuff to make them happy, and when I do eat I eat one time a day and Im fine, but my fiance is getting mad over that too.  I have no idea how to stop this I don't know how to stop trying so hard to make them happy, like litterly I spend my whole day doing stuff for them, and when one of them gets upset with me it breaks my heart and brings me tears and I beg and plead for their forgiveness just so their happy again, honestly its even affecting mine and my fiance's sex life Im so worried about whether Im doing it the way he wants me to or the way he likes that I dont enjoy it at all anymore.  Please help me!...
