After my twins were born almost four yeas ago, I suffered from ppd and started taking 10mg Prozac, which helped immediately, so I never increased the dosage to 20mg.  
Last October I found out my husband was having an affair for three years.  I was beyond devastated. 
Now, 6 months later, I have been through hell, I've seen 3 therapists and a psychiatrist and my GP.  I switched to Celexa in nov or dec, 20mg.  End of January of this year, dose was doubled to 40mg.  
Okay, so, believe it or not, my marriage is back on track, we have been seeing a therapist together and have become closer, plus, our sex life has never been better.  The problem is I feel so anxious and down and I'm starting to think it is the Celexa.  I only weigh 108 and am 5'7".  Any thoughts on whether maybe I'm taking too much and it's having the reverse effect?
I guess I feel like I should be feeling better, not worse at this point.  I was also prescribed ambien and Xanax which I've been taking for 6 mos.  I also think I was addicted to pain killers, which i have taken on and off during the last 6 mos.  they were first prescribed for back pain, then, I also had surgery in november, then I just kept taking them for depression.  I have not taken them for a couple weeks now.  
I'm thinking the pain killers were masking my anxiety and depression that was made worse by the Celexa?  What does anyone think?
