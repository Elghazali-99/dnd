Hi, I have been having bursts of depression for around two years now, however, the initial problem is the fact that I have very unstable relationships with people. This started when I was probably age 9, if not before, I used just flip between hating and getting along with my dads girlfriend at the age of 10/11. The real problems began to onset at the age of 12, I mean I had obsessions before, from the age of 7/8 to around 10 I used to obsess about dying and was really scared etc.., then at the age of 9/10 I was obsessing about bombs hitting our house, then it was probably worrying about seizures, then the big problem with idolizing people kicked in; I mean I just wish it would go away, I just can't help it I have just been thinking about the same person all the time- its not love and I know that its because I hold them to such high expectations as they do no wrong and help me out a lot.
    I just over analyse every little thing they say to me, their facial expressions etc..and am over-judgemental and hold everyone higher than they really are. I'm scared to even look at them or just see them twice in a day per say as I will be scared that they no longer like me and I would have pushed them away. I then, get very angry with myself until the next time I see them to see if they are okay with me. I have no clear barriers of what I want to do with my life it just seems like nothingness. I can see no future, no further than high school. But the influences of others. I have nobody really. I just want to please everyone, I'm confused with myself. Who am I? Then, I just hate specific people for one reason; of which the hatred is never lifted, once I hate someone that is it. I can rarely forget; But just be paranoid that they are with me at school. I am also paranoid again I have done wrong to a person that they will no longer like me.
