Gee, I couldn't figure out what topic section to choose--I'm kind of new to this. I saw a talk show the other day that mentioned stress-induced anoxeria, and a light bulb went off. I went through a nasty divorce a few years back, but even before that I quit eating with the family due to all the fighting.  Then, once I lived alone, it just seemed to be too much trouble to cook. It's not that I'm not hungry on occasion, but I open the pantry and look at the food, and I just can't.  My mother and my fiance are constantly after me to eat, and it kind of hit home the other day when a neighbor I hadn't seen in a while commented that I had lost weight--I knew that, but didn't think it was quite that obvious, even though my clothes aren't fitting like they used to. Now I've been unemployed for six months, and it's just more stress.
 I know on a subconscious level it's about the only thing I can control in my life--I learned that by raising two children. At the same time, I realize I'm no good to anyone if I don't stay healthly, and I just don't know how these days.
 I know something is wrong with me, and I need a mental adjustment, but just don't know what to do, or where to go..
