I had this thing on my face. it looked like a sunspot, i saw it after i had something like it on forehead for years. and i wanted it off. it was last and like skin . so i don't recall how long it was there. like more than 8 months to a year. finally i took a tweezer an pealed it off. then in like a day this thing grew out of it like a horn or wart, and it had kind of a scab on it and i also took that off. where it grew back and bean to itch. it was portrude off my eye on cheek and itch bad.. so i went to dr and got it biopsy.. with another one i was so glad to have the ugly other tin off. that i didn't even care if it wa cancer and was about to do them myself .. but it came back the one on face cheek positive for basel and squirms cell carcinomal what. but after the dr surgeon did surgery i  had no time to even think about what was going on. and was ill informed and I'm slow and have a brain issue and had a hard time to react to that situation so i said just do it. after that i had this kind of reaction that i was like on a state.. and felt i should done better to control that. si i researched the self healing  of cancer. what came up was A SELF HEALING CANCER. IT I SCALLED A FALSE CANCER OR FALSE SQUARMUS CELL CARCINOMA CALLED FERGUSON SMITH SYNDROM. . I DONT KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT PATHOLOGY HOW THEY DISTINQUISH THIS FROM A TRUE. ALTHOUGH I WAS VERY SMART I DONT HAVE THAT ANY MORE FOR NOW THREE WEEKS FROM AFTER I GOT TO THI SDR AS I HAD SOME KIND OF REACTION AND MY INTELLIGENCE NATRUL WAS REMOED WITH THE THING BY FREAKTHINGS. LEAVING ME REALY STUPID BUT TRYING HARD TO GET IT BACK. SO MY COMMON SENSE OF THINGS IS TWISTED, AND I ANT TO KNOW IF THE DR WAS JUST WANTING TO TAKE THIS OFF AND ITS MONEY TO THEM.. I READ AS MUCH AS THIS. THAT IT IS UNABLE TO BE DISTINGUISHED, BUT THAT IS A OCNTRADICTION BECASUE IF NOT THERE WOULD BE NO DEFINITION FOR IT AND SOMEONE HAS TO BE ABLE TO TELL..?
 DR FERGUSON SMITH FOR ONE. TO SEPERATE A FALSE FROM A REAL.. 
   so i want someone who might know, who had skin cancer diagnosis or tell ut that sometimes its not even cancer and it can be this and if u look closely to the photos of cancer and read it close. there are ways to determine or signs i saw that mhy own I'm afraid to ask my dr now.. if it was not or could not.. been cancer might maybe.. and all i read was that this can also turn to cancer..  so they take it off same way.. i got moms micro surgery and it got a scar but not that bad, and i was not afraid of the scar but at one point it did look ugly if it would stay raised like that.. but it has most def. come to almost can't even tell. i am a self do it healing and taught person on a high level over doctors and don't like anyone to come ear me because i was almost destroyed by sick doctors as a kid . and now someone also took my 19 years miracle of life and took that away. i trust doctors as far as i can throw them and this time i was not able to see ho far i could toss my surgeon. and he rushed past me when i asked or he said. this cancer grows slowly. i said to grew on one day and a few weeks from thanksgiving and got bigger. then rushed me. so i also filled him in on my  life where ei wa at that moment an how this was not as important to me as i was going to lose my life to something that no one took care of that fast, or dilgently as he did. i forgot money is the motive with doctors as god took care of me for that one second in life,
