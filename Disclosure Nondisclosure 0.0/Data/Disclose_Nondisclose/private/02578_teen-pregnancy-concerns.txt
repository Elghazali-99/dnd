I am 17, 18 next month. I am 19 weeks oregnant almost 20wks have gender testing on the 24th of this month but I am worried. Pregnancy hasnt been that well so far went to the hospital cause if bleeding a couple months ago but turned out being a uti. My obgyn hasnt really done nothing but blood work no sonos or nothing just heart beat... Im always cramping and spotting every now and then and I thought that was just suppose to be at the begining. Found out I have thyroid problems worried if everything is ok with my child :( 13 hypo (what I am) have had birth defects as where hyper is 8.... Is worries me that I havent had a sonogram before knowing all this... i am on meds now but from the look of it its to late to change doctors and more work and stress I really dont need since when I stress I cramp more. What should I bring up , what questions should I ask next appt.? Anyone else have a thyroid problem during pregnancy? Any tips... First pregnancy and I am really confused and lose and feel alone not knowing what to do to make sure my baby is 100% fine... So please any help?
