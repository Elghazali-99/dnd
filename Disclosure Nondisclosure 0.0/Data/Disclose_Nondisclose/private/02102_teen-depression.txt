Hi I am 16 and I am in highschool. I'm really good at what I do a lot of people tell me that I am real smart but I have a problem. I can't seem to concerntrate at my school work. My parents say that that i am lazy, but when i try to work on my school stuff my head feels heavy and my mind drifts it takes so much concerntration just to do some work. Its not that i don't know the stuff or understand but i loose interest like that! The wierd thing is that if i were to research on something like a new drawing techique on how to shade or how to write a good short story or if i was drawing a comic strip, i would do it and wouldn't feel like i have to push myself! I don't study for tests, i can't, so i relay on my memory and get Cs instead of As its sad especialy when my parents really want me to get good grades. Also im not enthusiastic about any career with a lot of studying reading big boring books I prefer colour and adventure but i mean i still have to ace highschool for that too. I have tried to study so many times but i just end up  getting up fustrated and i never get back to reading it. Its annoying! Why is this happening? Is it a psyciatric problem or something? I think there is something wrong even though my parents don't believe me! Can i get an answer from a professional if possible?
