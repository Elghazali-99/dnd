Hi,I am new here and my mood was really bad.(Sorry,my english is not fluent)I need advice and help.I am fifteen years old boy and I think I almost gonna destroy my teenage life.I was feel tired and feel want to take a nap every after school(In the evening) but I was set a Study Timetable for myself and only 2 weeks to prepare for my BIG exam,my last secondary school examination so I talk to myself..why feel tired? nap will waste my golden time for study/revision..but I feel very depress after that.I started my timetable with wake up at 4.20am and sleep 10pm,is it enough sleep for a teenage? And,I feel shame to say,I also have a bad habit,that is masturbate...Overdo it will cause brain damage and stressful but I just do it :( Besides,I just have fought with my young bro..because I ask him something then he answer me rudely..after that,I think I want to realise my stress and all..so blame on him but later I was scold by my mum..my mum told me that If you feel hate with your bro, back to your room..then I was feel I lost myself..lost all..not me anymore..what a foolish teenage.I can't controll myself very well to masturbate..I can't overcome my fatigue or no divide the time wisely maybe..I wish I can strike full of grade A for my big exam by study in this 2 weeks and I wish I can be a good runner in my school sports and become excellent teacher to come back my old school and teach the new generation of students..but I lost myself,fall into darkness,I need someone's advice or any support or helps..please :'( 
 sorry if I was too gossip
