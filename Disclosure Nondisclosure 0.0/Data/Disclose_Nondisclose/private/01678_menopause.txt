Hi, i hope someone can help i am really worried.  I have been having irregular periods for about a year and a half now and sometimes its brown sometimes red.  I have been having a discharge in between white/yellow, no smell and no itching.  Last month after 2 minutes after intercourse there was a small amount of pale pink fluid then a couple of days after i had my period.  I had a swab taken to rule out any infection because of the yellow discharge i had been having, this was negative but i still had antibiotics.  Everything seemed to clear up for about a week and no pink loss after intercourse.  However, as i have come closer to my next period, i have noticed more discharge and after intercourse i have had a small pink fluid loss again, i am having period pains as i am due on.  I was not so worried about the discharge but now i am having this pink fluid loss after intercourse i am concerned about it. It does seem to happen when im due a period but was hoping someone could put my mind at rest.  I am due to see the GP next week.
