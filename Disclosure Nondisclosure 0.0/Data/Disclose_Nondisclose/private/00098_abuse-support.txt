I was physically abused as a child and have been in denial for years.  My sister  faced the fact a long time ago but abuse still has effected both of our lives in negative ways.  Although our personalities are so different we both approached dealing with it differently.  Neither of us has been able to handle intimate relationships with men.  Both of us tend to go after abusive men...it's like we drew them.  We have both excepted we cannot handle close and intimate relationships with men and have abandoned ever having long term intimate relationships.  My sister dealt  with life as a fighter, angry at the world, in pain inside.  I dealth with life in a forgiving way and allowed people to walk all over me. The more a man would be abusive to me, it was like I would try harder and harder to please them, not wanting to let go and the more I forgave their actions and made it okay to treat me abusively.  It still scares me to see a man get angry.  Over the last few years my anger has surfaced, I am out of denial and I have times of rages and have become somewhat aggressive.  How much of this is from my Bipolar and how much is  due to the abuse, I do not know.  Perhaps the abuse has lead to Bipolar, I don't know. 
How has other people dealt with physical abuse as a child and how has it effected your life and how has it effected your behavior as an adult. Does witessing a man's anger still scare you? Were you angry at yourMom for allowing the abuse and do you see your mother was abused also and scared?
