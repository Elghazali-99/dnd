Please help I'm so scared.
 I had unprotected sex on Sept. 4th, the guy used the pull out "method", then about 10 hours later I took Next Choice. My period was supposed to start around the 22nd of Sept. I took two First Response pregnancies tests that were both negative (the first on Sun. 09/22 and the second on Wed. 09/25). I took another test on 10/03 that was negative. Three negative results but my period is 12 days late!!!! I'm really worried that I might be pregnant. The box said that Next Choice could delay your next period but by this much? Im not experiencing any pregnancy symptoms as far as I can tell; however, for the past week Ive felt like i was about to start menstruating but nothing came of it. Do you think I should go to the doctor?! Am I pregnant?! I am so worried.
 ***Yes I know it was stupendously stupid and irresponsible of me and believe me when I say, I will not be that stupid ever again. It was my first time having sex and I really dont plan on doing it for a long time after this nightmare.
