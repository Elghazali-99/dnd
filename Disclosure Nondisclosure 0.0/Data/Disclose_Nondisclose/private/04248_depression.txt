I have a treatment resistant form of depression that has not responded to numerous traditional antidepressant medications, although I have tried many. I was finally referred to a top research university to consult with a doctor who specializes in treatment resistant depression (TRD - an appropriate acronym if ever there was one). He has done many clinical studies treating TRD with Provigil (as have other research hospitals) and it is one of the few medications (well, the only, actually) that has helped me. The problem is that my insurance company refuses to cover the medication, which is $2400 out of pocket for the generic form. I just cannot afford to pay $29,000 a year for medication. I started by calling the pharmaceutical company to inquire about assistance, but they have canceled their Provigil assistance program and also told me that depression is one of the few illnesses for which they do not provide assistance anyway. I then looked into other assistance programs, but they require enrollees to be without insurance, and giving up my health insurance is just not practical. So I then considered drug discount cards and the best deal I could find was a 10% discount, a cost that is still too prohibitive. So I am left with the real possibility of either using what little savings I have to cover this medication, until my savings are exhausted, or to go without one of the only medications I've found that helps me. Has anyone found any other creative ways to cover the cost of expensive medications that aren't covered by health insurance? I do not know what to do at this point. Thank you for your help.
