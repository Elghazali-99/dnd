Idk why it says im female im actually a guy and im 19.Yeah I hope somone sees this, I woke yesterday feeling depressed. I didn't want to get out of bed and everyone thought I was being weird. I tried eating my eggs but I just couldn't without the thought of me barfing so I gave to the dog. I felt my stomache hungry but I just could not eat. I tried making myself eat all of my burger but I had left a quarter of it. That was Sunday. I remember Friday night before I went to this boys house and his mom tried giving me a burrito but the thought of eating that was revolting. I didn't even want the puzooki his sister had made for me but I ate it anyways. Me and him fooled around a lot naked and drank whiskey. Okay back to sunday. I met up with friends and smoked some wax. I tried to be as social as I can be since I felt ally better after eating that burger. Later on my mother demanded to know what was wrong and stated I look unhealthy. I told her I have no idea? There are factors that may be the reason but its unforsure. I have to pay this fine of 700 dollars so I might move to South Dakota. My grandpa had just come the night before with my uncle. I've had a traumatizing expirence of being humiliated by my gpa. So I do not really like him and my uncle was kinda being a know it all ****. Please if anyone has any thoughts just message me. Btw I feel a lot better today which is Monday though I'm still unsure of my appetite will be cooperative with me
