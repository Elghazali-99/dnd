I didn't know where to post this. I'm 51 year old female who's been married for 28 years to an abusive husband. He's physically, emotionally, verbally abusive. I m disabled. Panic disorder, agoraphobia (most of the time) and depression. I cry almost all the time. I also have many physical problems. Some have not been diagnosed still looking for answers. I have hypothyroidism and cAnt get my dose right, seems to change a lot. I'm anemic  been taking iron, b12 and folic acid for a few years. I smoke, and I can't seem to quit.  I get throbbing pain in my calves when walking. Many more health problems. I don't have anyone to talk to or help me. My mom has dementia and my siblings are not close and don't want to hear my problems. I've been to many physiologists and not getting better. I take meds for the anxiety and depression but they don't work anymore. I'm allergic to many others I've tried or I get pretty bad side effects from them. I feel stuck. Lonely, depressed, anxious. I don't know where to turn. I don't want to end up in a mental institution. I'm surprised I haven't been there yet. Don't know what to do. I think I've run out of places to turn
