Well my friend tells me that I missed my period due to stress, but anyways, I have had a missed period for 3 days (going on 4 on August 9th) and I had sex with my boyfriend on July 23rd I believe and finally August 5th. I have had slight cramping in my stomach and not to mention a bubbling sensation. My period was supposed to start August 6th, the day after my boyfriend and I had sex. BUT IT DIDNT SHOW UP! And I cannot afford to have a child. I know I'm young and stupid and that's what I get. But still. I have slight cramping and no bleeding! Could it be that I'm having implantation symptoms? And if so, is there a way to stop it? Both times I have had unprotected sex due to him wanting it and I gave in because of various reasons. I really need to know if this is a pregnancy possibility, or if it is just stress. I have also had a milky white discharge today. Is there also any way for me to induce my period? The answer to these questions could be really helpful! So please help! Thank you!
*no I am not having breast tenderness, nausea, or bloating. Although I do feel constipated....
