I think I may be depressed, I'm 14 year old girl, I want to talk to someone about it, but I don't want to talk to my parents because they won't listen and my mum will think I am just attention seeking which she said when I spoke to her about being dyslexic, which I haven't been tested for. I don't want to speak to my friends either because they think I'm stupid and a idiot and that I am really thick because they all have great grades and I don't, I have **** grades and I feel like my teachers hate me, I want to become a pilot but I have no hope of that because my grades just keep going down and everyone says oh u need to put more work in but I am they don't understand that's what I have been doing and now I've basically given up , my future is hopeless so I don't see the point anymore.
I'm not happy and I keep asking myslef what is the point in life, I'm to scared to attempt sucide but I think about self harm and I did but not to a great extent. I don't know what to do. 
I do want to get better but I don't know how I would talk to someone about it without my parents knowing or being told or just finding out, I don't mind if they find out if the doctor talks to them but I don't want to and I don't think I would feel comfortable talking to them someone on the phone.
