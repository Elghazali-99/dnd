ok i wasn't sure where to ask this but i have this fear of becomeing schizophrenic and starting ro hear voices. i never actually knew what the disease was until my dad mentioned it and i was curious and had to research it. it scared the crap out of me to think OMG what it must be like to hear voices and hallucinate. my family has no history of this disorder on either side that i know of but it still freaks me out what are my chances of getting it. and yes i have alot of anxiety and i do see a therapist and she says i'm fine but i just don't know how to not think of it. please help because everytime i think of it i freak myself out and what scares me even more is that people will tell me if i keep thinking about it it will actually happen. is this true because hearing that makes me think of it even more. i'm just so tired of living in a constant state of fear because not even two months ago i was fine and normal then this happened and i haven't been myself since. i'm always scared ofstupid things and i never get out anymore
