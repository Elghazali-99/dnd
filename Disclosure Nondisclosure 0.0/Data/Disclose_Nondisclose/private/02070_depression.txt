My behavioral health care specialist now states the "Federal Law" says the he chaarges $200.00 for office visit ( usually about 15mins) then because he writes me several prescriptions, that he has to charge another $200.00 to write them. Is this really true that its a federal law about charging for writing 'scripts. Then I have to say....shouldn't my actual chage for my visit....15 min....lil more lil less....should that be prorated...or next time I'm just going to sit for the whole 50mins to get my value.  Also.....I have waited 1hr, 1 1/2 hr to see him...not so much anymore since I took him to task....I will no longer wait more then 20 mins unless its an emergency for someone. To wait 1- 1/2 hrs....then only see him 10 mins.....and get charged $200.00 for visit, now another $200.00 because he writes me prescription...is absolutley over the top!!!  Then to fill them.....not 1 of my presciptions costs less then $450.00 to fill.....THAT'S WITH UNION LABORER INSURANCE!!!! How can I cut my charges, what's legal, not legal.....HELP!!!
