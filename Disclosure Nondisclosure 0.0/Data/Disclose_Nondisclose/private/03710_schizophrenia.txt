I realize that a person is not delusional if they have moments of doubt. I was this way for two years. The delusions would change but they were powerful. However, since my thoughts have become considerably more sensible, I doubt any extraordinary thought.
 I'm wondering if delusion is also based on duration. This morning I woke up feeling like I could be possessed. It made me very worried which may mean that it has more to do with anxiety. I've felt like I could be possessed or sell my soul usually every day.
 A couple of months before I thought I was pregnant. I knew it was crazy because I've never had intercourse, but I was so worried, checking my stomach and waiting for my period. I still have this fear in a different way that I would rather not discuss.
 Is this something I should be concerned about? I plan on visiting a psychiatrist anyway, but sometimes these things seem so familiar to me I don't know if I actually have something important enough to come to a psychiatrist with.
