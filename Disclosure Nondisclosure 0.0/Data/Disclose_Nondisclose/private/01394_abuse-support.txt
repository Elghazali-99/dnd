Hi, I'm new here, but I thought I'd sign up to ask this question after reading many different posts about parents worried because their children seem sexually active. Almost every response to these types of questions mentioned that the child probably underwent sexual abuse. As a child, I know that my brother and I (I am a girl) touched each other inappropriately on numerous occasions and felt very guilty about it from a young age, as if we knew it was wrong, but we weren't entirely sure why. Now, I don't remember most of my childhood, I only remember some snippets, which include this premature sexual behavior, and beginning in my late teens, I have felt very lost and confused because I really want to know about my past and what happened to me. I know that my mother was physically abusive (hitting, scratching, throwing, etc), those memories make up most of most of the very few that I have, but I don't know anything about sexual abuse. To this day, I have an incredibly high sexual drive and in high school, when I was living at home, I could probably be considered an addict, and I have always been drawn to abuse fantasies and the like. My sexual issues have been a source of so much pain throughout my (considerably short) life and my parents and general community have always heaped all of the blame on me, causing even more mental issues. I guess I'm just tired of feeling guilty and feeling like this is all my fault. Is this normal child behavior (the sexual interaction with my brother from ages 4-7 or so) or is it possible that I was sexually abused and I have blocked it out (which could be why I don't have memory before middle school)? I'm sorry this is so long, I doubt anyone will read this all the way through so here's a TL;DR- I was sexually active with my brother at a young age and I have almost no memory of my childhood until age 12 or so. Could I have been sexually abused?
