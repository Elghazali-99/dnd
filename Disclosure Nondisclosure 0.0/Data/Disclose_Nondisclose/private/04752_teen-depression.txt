Well, this isn't the first time I've felt depressed. I have lots of mood swings. I go from being happy to downright depressed FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. I have indulged in self harm but no worries, I'm not gonna kill myself. If I did, Gen would kill me! Gen is my best friend. I've told her about what's going on. But both of us are too young to find a 'solution'. 
I can't get to sleep without lying around for ages and at times when I get sleep I still feel tired.
I can't concentrate on anything! I used to get good grades but now I'm bad at academics. I don't have any interest in social life at all. I just hate reality so I space out all the time. When I can, I put my headphones on at full volume. 
I don't have many friends and nor do I like talking to people. I don't want my parents to worry so they don't know anything. 
I want to do better. Can anyone help me get out of this dream like disconnected state? AND FOR GODS SAKE DONT RECOMMEND STUFF LIKE MEDITATION DAMMIT! Ah, forgot to mention [I tend to forget things] I'm 14.
