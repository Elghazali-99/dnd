Me and my partner have been together for 4 years and in a lot of ways I always felt she was my soul mate. We have a mortgage and 2 year old daughter.I go through bouts of depression, and during a particular bout last year she started talking to a guy from work... I found out they kissed at the Xmas party but she insisted it wouldn't happen again. After that I became paranoid and started checking her Facebook and phone etc... They were getting close and I was so devastated that I broke up with her. She started seeing him and I was in a bad place, drugs, drink you name it, I lost my whole life it felt. Then I started to see someone who totally picked me up and I started to feel happy again! Then she came back to me and said she realised what a terrible mistake she'd made and we got back together. I am now starting to regret that decision as she's started to talk to another guy from work! She's even accepted gifts from him! Things have been going great since we got back together I just don't understand, I've pulled her up on it but she insists they're just friends but I feel so disrespected once again... I feel like I can't live with her but thinking of life without her and seeing my little girl everyday kills me inside :'( what would you do?
