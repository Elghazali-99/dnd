"The mass is 25 x 13.6 x 11.2 cm right hepatic lobe with distortion of the liver edge"  this was determined by ultra sound last week in my husband, 68. 
 he went to the doctor because he had pain in his side, was losing a lot of weight, felt full and uncomfortable with loss of appetite.  no jaundice.  blood work showed elevated creatinine, AFP and liver enzymes messed up.  
he has, maybe, three drinks a week after golf.  he was a heavy drinker for a long time but stopped three years ago when an ultra sound showed possible cirrhosis or fatty liver.  follow up MRI found Nothing so we quit thinking about it.  and...he smokes cigars, a lot, and inhales.  
  He has a CT with contrast scheduled and more blood work.  He's the kind who doesn't like to think about bad stuff and I'm the kind who wants to think about it and research it.  I want to be prepared so I can be at my best for him.
 This seems to me to be an inordinately large mass.  I wonder how long it's been there.  What can it be?  Is it more likely than not malignant?  Primary or met?  The doctor has mentioned biopsy as a following step.  Will that be necessary and what about the risks?  Spreading the cells.
 He is being seen at a large teaching military hospital.  I want to be referred to UCSF.
 I'd love some feedback from anybody who knows about this stuff.  thank you!
