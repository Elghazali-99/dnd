I married a woman with anorexia and BPD.  She had been in counseling for years, but the psychologist just listened and validated her experience.  She required constant attention and for me to "entertain" her.  She talked to her mother (who she said was the cause of all her problems ) for hours while I was asleep and then sleep while I was at school and work.  She disparaged our lack of a house (I am in college), lack of money (her family is very wealthy but did not give us anything which I was ok with), lack of friends to me constantly.  I stayed as we are Mormon and don't believe in divorce.  One day I came home and she had disappeared.  Her mother had driven across 2 states to pick her up  (and most of our household belongings) and took her home. She refused to speak to me, telling me by email that she wanted a divorce.  She then changed her email, cell number, and blocked me on FB.  She had actually told me that she had done this with a prior boyfriend also.  The divorce was arranged through her cousin.  She never gave me a reason.  I was not abusive in any way.  I feel like I am going crazy and people look at me in church like I have done something terrible to be treated this way.  How do I explain it? How do I ever trust a woman again?
