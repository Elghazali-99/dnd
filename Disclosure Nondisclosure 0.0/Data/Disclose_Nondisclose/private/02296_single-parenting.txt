I got pregnant with this man 8 years ago.  I liked him a lot but we did not plan to get married or have children.  When I got pregnant I was as surprised/shocked as he was.  When I told him I am not going to have an abortion, he couldn't deal with it.  He saw our daughter briefly a few times over the years, (mainly because I sued him for child support) but he showed absolutely no feelings for the child.  That was the part that really hurt me badly.  He was ignoring his own daughter.  He never even told his family about her. I know during this time he had some relationships, he got married briefly and got divorced.  But all those years, he never showed any genuine interest in our daughter.
Now our child is almost 7 years old and suddenly he called and said he wants to see her.  That was what I wanted all the time: that he wants to see her.  He's been seeing her for 3 months now and they have developed the best father-daughter relationship in the world!.  He says he loves her and she loves him and they have a lot of fun together.  
So what is the problem, you are wondering?  Well, I just do not feel comfortable with this.  I mean I am glad that they spend time together, but every time he tells her he loves her, I feel like it's a lie.  I want to do what is good for my child so I say nothing, but how can this be true?  How can he really love her when he turned his back on her even though he saw her when she was born?  I imagined if he ever comes back he would be more like a pal/friend for my daughter - and in real life he actually comes back as the best and closest father one can imagine.  It is as if he has been always with her.  He has even moved into a house next door to be close to her.  He is so loving and hugging and caring - but it just happened.  All of a sudden he became like a completely different person.  Can a person's feelings change so much?  Can this be real?
