So I have been going through something mentally for quit some time now. It all started 5 years ago.
One day in the morning time when I was in light sleep I noticed my hand automatically move up and poke me in my right eye. I had no idea how that would happened on its own. After that I began to feel scared that what if in the night time my hand automatically scratch my eyes or poke them again. Thank god that did not happened. Recently 2 years ago I got injured in my private area. 6 months later one day during the morning my hand automatically moved up and landed hard on my private area. It hurt frown.gif. Once again I did not move my hand and it moved on it's own.
  This is the part that makes me feel really sad:
 2 days ago during the night time I had a itch in my left eye. I scratched my eye lid and after noticed I lost conscious. I think I may have poked my eye in my sleep. When I got up in the morning I felt a little pain in my eye. Now I think I am being paranoid but maybe my left eye was poked in my sleep by me and it may have been damaged my eye. Thank god I can still see. but still I am guessing I injured my eye and may have caused damage.
 here is the thing with me. Lets say I injure my finger and go through the stress of did I break it or is it fine. If I turns out to be fine. I feel happy. But then I think to my self Im gonna damaged your finger in your sleep. And my hand would automatically move and grab my finger and squeezing it. I would have no control :(.  < that was just an example. 
 Can you please tell me why this is happening to me?
 What is this and how can I cure this.
