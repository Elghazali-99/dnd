Hi! I'm actually not older than 20s, but I've been having problems. I don't want to make a big fuss out of it, but i'm still a bit curious of why I'm like this.
My problem is that before, at least once a month I've been having pain at the bottom of my ribs. I didn't make a big problem out of it because I thought it was just temporarily. But ever since I've come back from a trip, it's been hurting a lot more each month. I've always had a cramp while my period, therefore I thought that was the problem. It still kept going even after my period. One time, it became so unbearable that I had to stop for a while. It used to not hurt when I push it and now it does. It's also spreading around my stomach and chest. I never smoked, but I did have a surgery. Not a big thing because it was about my mouth and hip. Before this many pain, i did have a flu that made my body hurt a lot! Especially my ears. I also have depression. There are no swells and I never physically fought with someone. Oh, but it hurts A LOT when I need to go to the bathroom to defecate . Not only once,  but quite a few times.
Can someone help me? Should I really see the doctor?
