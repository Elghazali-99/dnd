Can stress cause back pain, itching, tingling, and numbness?
 For past 2 weeks, I have a small about 4 inch area on my back in which I have this intermittent crawling and burning sensation under the skin surface. It started on my right shoulder blade as kind of a numbness, then progressed to tingling.  It comes and goes and is often more annoying than painful. However, from time to time, it actually becomes painful.  There is no rash or bumps associated with it and sometimes it goes away when changing position.  I'm 28 years old and have not had any back injuries to speak of.  I have lost weight recently, about 40 lbs through diet and exercise.  Many things I've read online point to notalgia paresthetica, but I was wondering if maybe it could be stress related at all.  I am a college student and am under a lot of stress as its the end of the semester.  I haven't been getting much sleep and I have most of the other physical symptoms of stress.  Any thoughts?  (I posted this in the neurology forum too).  
 Does anyone have good stress relief tips?  I can't seem to shut my mind off at night and I'm only getting 3 hours of sleep a night as a result.
