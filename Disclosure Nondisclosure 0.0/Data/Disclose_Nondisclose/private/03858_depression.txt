I've been struggling with depression and anxiety since i was 9. i'm 18 now and going to college. i know i have these mental issues but i feel so unstable that sometimes I'm afraid that i am crazy. I've been suicidal in the past, been hospitalized once and been in crisis homes four times. but my emotions are so strong. i always have some sadness with me even when I'm happy. i also have suicide linger in the back of my mind. (I've told my doctors and therapists) the good news is, i know what my struggles are and even in my darkest times, i can reach out for help. but i'm definitely not my safest. i have decided not to get my drivers license right now because I'm afraid i will feel so awful one day and go out and buy sleeping pills. i'm going to college near home in a city so its not very necessary at the moment. i keep myself around other people when i feel suicidal or even before then. but my question is, well, i know this isn't normal, but is there anyone else who feels this way at my age or close to my age? i feel alone in this situation.
