so long story short, i was at a party and called one of my guy friends that i occassionally hook up with if he could pick me up and if i could stay at his house for the night.  i was obviously very drunk it wasnt hard to tell. all i remember is making it up the stars and onto the bed and i remember having my shorts on because i changed out of my jeans and into more comfortable shorts. the next day i asked him if we had sex he said yes and that i passed out. it made me really mad that he would have sex with me when he knew how drunk i was. however, i remember waking up and my shorts were on. when i told my best friend what happened and that he said we did have sex she joked and said it was kind of like he raped me. and when she said it we  both immediately thought it easily could have been like that. 
just because i have had sex with him before does that mean it cant technically be rape? and i blacked out, i dont remember anything about having sex with him, which is pretty scary to me. he told me he used a condom which im sure he did. but it still freaks me out that i couldve been passed out and he couldve just been having sex with me...
 what should i do
