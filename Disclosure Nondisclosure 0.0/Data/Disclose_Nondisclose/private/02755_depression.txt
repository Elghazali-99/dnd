Hi I had a bad throat infection a year ago, it's left me with a lump in a throat sensation, achey glands, sore throats that
come and go. The lump in throat sensation is always there, some days worse than others but it affects my quality of life.
Went to Dr's they said it was anxiety, which it could be cause I am a long term sufferer of depression. Anyway to cut a long story short I changed medications to venlaxafine which worked well with my mood but left me with some nasty side effects, a year on still getting sore throats and lump in throat sensation with choking and gagging could it be a side effect of my venlafaxine? Or acid reflux I had a barium swallow xray everything came back normal and ent he said I had chronic pharyngitis, no lumps advisable but some tissue at back of my throat that keeps getting inflamed.. also tried calcium to try relax throat muscles it didn't work. It has to be something that keeps irritating my throat the only thing that has changed in the last year is my medication, I wonder if it is the venlaxafine? Can anyone shed any light on this?
