My mother is a breast cancer survivor. She finished chemo and radiation over a year ago. She has been sick for the past week with headaches nausea and back pain. This morning it became so severe that she finally gave in and went to the ER. She had elevated inter cranial pressure and CSF pressure.  We were told that she has meningitis but they have yet to pin point what kind. After making the mistake of googling i've come across a form of meningitis known as neoplastic meningitis or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis where basically cancer cells reoccur and invade the CNS. Is this a legitimate concern for someone who had early stage breast cancer and was thoroughly treated or is this a complication which occurs in patients who still have cancer or who's cancer is more aggressive and has metastasized. Would symptoms appear quickly, over a matter of a couple of days and then get progressively worse? She goes for regular check ups with her oncologist and everything is always normal.
