I'm married and thinking seriously about walking away.  I'm no longer attracted to her and I find myself attracted to many other women I want to pursue.
 I still love her and care deeply for her, but I'm not in love anymore. I don't know how or if I should drop this grenade on her or continue on in my own unhappiness.  I can't point to why I'm unhappy, I just am. I'm bored and annoyed by her. I feel like I always have to be accountable for my activities and location, like I can't just go off and do something or go somewhere without her.  I feel trapped. I want to travel and meet exotic beautiful women. I want to meet exotic beautiful women near where I live too.  I fantasize about having my own place to live and being able to cook and entertain dates there.
 My wife loves me and has few faults- at least none I can use to justify leaving. She doesn't use drugs, steal, abuse, etc.  she works hard and is responsible and mature.
 I worry about regrets.
 I also want to be with a gorgeous, genuine hearted, optimistic and kind woman with whom I had an affair lasting several years but which ended a few years ago. We were both married but she left her abusive husband.  I still have a place in her heart and we could fall in love again. I know she has been leading her own life the last few years, and she has dated others but no one serious... Yet.
 Anyhow, I'd appreciate your insight and advice. Why am I not happy. I guess I'm the classic walk-away-husband waiting to happen.
 Thanks.
