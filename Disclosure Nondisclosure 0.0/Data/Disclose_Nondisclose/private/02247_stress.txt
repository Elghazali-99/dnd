I had my gallbladder taken out last year due to big gallstones and also some attacks.  When this was done I had skin irritiations come up and thought that they were due to the pills and anesthetic that I took.  Since then I have had about sitautions of blister-like sores on my arms only but also hive-like sores around my waister and back, plus buttocks.  This also comes with some insect-like bites on my legs too.  All my tests keep saying an irritation to something but we cannot find out what.  My thoughts are - could I be having a reaction to bile in my body as I have no gallbladder to store it and it comes out into my skin?  I know it sounds strange, but have thought this might be what is happening to me - even though my dcotor says he is sure it would not be the cause.  Have tried to see if it is linked to when I eat any sort of fat.  What do you think?  Or is this just from stress and depression?  Can skin irritations that come quite frequently be the cause of stress??
