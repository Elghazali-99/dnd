I was in a semi-relationship with a BPD for about 3 months. This was the second time we were together. The first time was when she was on a break from another relationship and ended up going back to the other guy. When I heard they broke up I contacted her again and we started dating again. This is when she told me the she was diagnosed with BDP. I started reading about it to get an idea of what to expect. When she started backing away I started to worried. When I asked her about it she blew up at me. I tried for a month to have a conversation with her, which I now realize was the worst thing I could have done, because it just made things worse. After about a month she said she had started seeing someone else. I got upset and she got mad at me and freaked out thinking that I was going to go to her new boyfriend and start something. She ended up cutting me out of her life and even had the new boyfriend block me on facebook. After reading more about BPD I know this behavior is typical. In short, I really care about this person and don't want them out of my life even if it's just as a friend. And it really hurts that she went as far as to have the new boyfriend block me. I was wondering if there is any advise that can others with experience can give me to apologize to her. I've thought of several possibilities: texting (if she hasn't blocked my number), writing her a letter, etc. And how long should I wait before I do. I don't want to freak her out any more, but I can't stand that she thinks of me as such horrible person that I would do something like that.
