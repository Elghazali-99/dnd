Hi, I'm a 20 year old female, currently 3rd year medical student. I have previously (at the age of 16years) experienced the feeling of derealization and became obsessed with the possibility of becoming schizophrenic. I did not seek proffessional help during this time and it passed on its own. Now 4 years later, I've experienced the same symptoms since December 2012. I feel disconnect, have existential thoughts (like who am I, what is life etc.) and have again become paranoid about developing schizophrenia. I have seen both a psychologist and a psychiatrist, who seem to think I have GAD and traits of hypochondriasis. (i've previously taken pregnancy test and HIV tests out of fear even though I'd never realisticly been exposed to semen i.e Oral sex). My mind now seems constantly anxious, and I always double check on things I see in my peripheral vision. I monitor all my thoughts constantly freaking out if anything strange pops up in case it's a sign. I do sleep more, but considering I'm a medical student this could be rationalized. I have a good relationship with my boyfriend and one or 2 good friends. Some of my other friendships have deteriorated recently (but do to circumstance not my social withdrawal I hope). I have never done drugs, barely drink and have no family history of mental disease except for depression in one of my grandfathers. I do have a great aunt who was quite strange, but she didnt have any disorders that I know about. I would just like to know if this sounds like schizophrenia and if not what is my risk of developing it?
