My husband and I have a blended family. I really struggle because my mother inlaw always has my 7 year old step son and allows and promotes behavior that is not ok. He is allowed to cuss, scream at others, be rude and hateful and there are no consequences. I have been with my husband for 6 years now and I do not know how to say anything. His mother is an addict and is not in the picture hardly ever and my mother in law has taken up that role. I work full time and my mother in law was picking up my children and dropping them off at their tutoring program, during this time She would ALWAYS make them sit in the back seat because my step son does not have to share, she told my 10 year old daughter that "snitches get stitches"(my daughter had told my husband the night before that my 7 year old step son had been fighting at school), she would allow my step son to scream in my 11 year old sons face..the list goes on and on. I am furious and found someone else to pick my children up ....but I do not know how to address this. I feel like my husband is not doing enough for his son and I feel like my kids are not 2nd rate kids compared to my step son. I just dont know how to handle this with out being over confrontational or causing problems. If anyone has any advise please help. Thanks
