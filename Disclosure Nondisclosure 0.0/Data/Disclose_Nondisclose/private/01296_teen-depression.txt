I can't even be happy at my friends any more. I'm never happy anymore I'm always sad. But it's hard to explain exactly how I feel. Kinda like everyone hates me and dosent want me around. I'm usualy the one to be talking non stop the one that everyone tells a million times to shut up. But to igbt I just dident feel like talking. I hardly said anything. Maby like 10 words in the last 2 hours. Were as usualy I can't stop talking. I just can't knock this feeling of sadness. Do you think it's connected to the fact that a year ago Sunday August 15th was the morning my brother passed??? Since he died I have began to hate myself even more but befor the year mark came up I was still talkitive. But know I just don't ever feel like talking to anyone. I haven't tryed to kill myself since the year mark. I tryed twice befor almost did 2 other times and wanted to many other times. Though since the year mark came I haven't really let my think about trying because I don't want to bring anymore pain to anyone then they are already feeling at this point. Not that people would be sad if I did being it's me and I just annoy most and probably all people. Intact they would probably be releived because I wouldent be able to annoy them anymore. Sure they might be the teensyest bit sad at first but in the long run they would be much happeir because they wouldent have to listion to or watch how stupid I am. I can see and feel myself turning my sadness into anger and taking it out on my sister when she trys to hang with me. I feel rude for it but she annoys me. Everything annoys me latly. Usualy everything about me though I don't know why I'm taking it out on her I don't want to and I feel terrible for it =(
