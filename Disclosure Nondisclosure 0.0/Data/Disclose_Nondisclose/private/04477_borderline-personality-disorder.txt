Hi all.
Im new to the site.
Unfortunately what brings me here is total frustration and just barely hanging on.
 I have bpd and bipolar II.
I had made really good progress and was doing very well, stable on my meds.
I moved 3 months ago and my meds have run out for about 6 weeks now.
I know i went through some withdrawal stuff and at this point every minute is painful as i watch myself just slipping away.
 The new psych office here saw me the first week of oct. and then on the second week. I had to be seen atleast 7 days apart and by the therapist for the first 2 times before they would refer me to the psychiatrist to get my meds restarted.
 So for the past 7 days and for the next 13 days i wait..and wait...and wait..and suffer until my first appt with the doc on november 1.
 I dont know if i can make it. Every minute is becoming so much more painful.
My family, Husband and kids and my family where i moved from in another state just watching me slip away.
 Im too afraid to call the 24 hour help line. I dont know what to tell them.
 I called the regular MD office today in desperation that maybe they could start me on something. Anything.
They can see me on wed..
I dont think i can handle anymore disappointment.
 Im trying so hard to live...so why is it so hard to find help?
My docs from the other state wont write me anything. I feel like my move is becoming a death sentence.
 I dont know what step to try to take now. I need help and there does not seem to be any to be found.
