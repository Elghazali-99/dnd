Hello,
 i don't know how to start and i don't know if i post this message in the right place..i just want to talk to a psychiatryst and to fix my problem wich is not that easy ,specially i don't know where i am for sure...my life wasn't nice never,i was born in a poor familly,my father was violent and i was scared and depressive all the time .7yrs ago (now i am 36yrs old) a man in my llife tryied to kill me in one night ,when i had the intention to split up with him becouse of his addiction of alcohool.That man was the father of my son.We r not toghether anymore.After few yrs i had another relationship with another man,wich was shouted on me every single day.When i said is enough and i want to split up again he said ok but he wan't to spend few more weeks in my appartment becouse of financial problems.I said ok but i was affraid of a violent reaction like trying to kill me or something like that.During those weeks i start to feel strong vibrations in my ears,and after in my brain,i started to see that man very similar to my father,to hear voices ,to belive that i am jesus,to stop thinking,to cry for days and to see scaring faces on the walls and on the street.Nobody knows how i felt for 3 or 4 months when my brother sent me to hospital.From that day i take pills (solian).If i don't take those pills i am back in my head,with no social contacts.Diagnosis was "psychotic episode" but i know that all my simptoms are very similar to paranoide schizophrenia.I asked my doctor if my disorder is that and the answer was just another question "so what if is that?"..so i don't know what i have ,i don't know if i have to be very carefull with me and my treatment or with my son wich is very sensitive like i was before..i just don't know what to do.I try to fix myself but is very hard,i have moments when i feel very good and moments ,if someone is shout on me i just hide inside my brain,when i feel worst and i take pills,a minimal dose from time to time.I just want you to help me ,to tell me what to do or what else i can try.i forgot to tell u that in the last 4yrs i finished university in psychology with no final examination but now i know more about psychotherapy and about me,but i can not fix myself still..I need your help and i hope i will have it.
 Thank you
