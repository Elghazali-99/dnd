Is this normal ?
Just got some lab blood tests.Hormonal ones, done a month ago as routine
Im 45 yo and till the date the stuff was collected my menstruation was coming every month
It didnt come in March, nor in April till today and Im NOT PREGNANT.
Tests results shows
FSH 62,80 MUI/ML  - rated that only fits to a pos menopausa rate printed
Prolactine  30, 29ng/mL  - that fits none of the options  - pre menopause 3,3 to 26, 7 ng/ml
                                                                                           pos menopause 2,7 to 13,1 ng/ml
All  others results are ok : T3 T4, free tiroxin, LH,TSH,,Stradiol 17 beta
 Does anybody knows if it matchs with menopause? For sure I will come back to doctor with those plus my mamograph and pelvic us ( both ok)but I still need wait for another unimportant ( in my situation) test to get ready.
I was wondering if its just a menopause or pre menopause situation or something different is happenenig and I should go there now and forget the one that will take me a month or more to get ready
