This is my first time talking about this its seems to be eating at me more and more as i get older....I have had some things happen to me as a young girl and have never talked about and said to myself that i would take it to the grave with me! until now .. I know it was abuse but not to a extreme extent or mybe it was but ..im hoping that this will help me deal abit more.. 
 I was about 5 or 6 years old and one of my childhood friends was being sexual abused and she would touch me too, at the time i didnt know it was wrong because i didnt know any better at my age i didnt know anything about sex. I never told my parents and still have not... But i do remember being very uncomfertable and upset all the time but just did not know why!.. 
 It had gone on for awhile and i didnt want to go with my parents to her house because of that..but they drug me with anyways and told me to stop being a brat... 
 Then at the age of 8 one of my parents friends husband had kissed me on the lips and my mother had seen it and again nothing was done ,I remember my step father being upset but it was not talked about with me....I am 20 now and these mems still haunt me and i cant seem to get rid of them... I'v been with my b/f for a year and 2 months And i dont know if i should tell him about my past, im a very sexual person and i think its because of my past, Now as a adult i know it was wrong and get angry  with myself and towards my parents for letting it happen and not listioning to me when i didnt want to go places... 
 Is this something i should let my b/f know or should i just take it to the grave as my orginal plan..thanks
