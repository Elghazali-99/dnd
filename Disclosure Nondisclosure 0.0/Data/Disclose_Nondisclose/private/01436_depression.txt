See, I suffer with being over weight. I've always had to deal with since I was about 16 now 20. People always have put me down no matter what for it. And honestly I wish I could get rid of the weight…but due to depression it seems impossible. The one thing that always made me feel confident in myself was listening to this one band's music. Their music has always been the type to give their fans confidence….unlike many that talk about sex and partying. So one of people in the group (my idol) has just bashed haters who bully her by stating on the longs like this… "You have to ignore the hate. It's hard at times, but I know that they are just insecure about themselves. So they probably are overweight and smelly haters." 
 This is along the lines of what my idol said btw. My heart feels like it has just dropped when I heard that he/she had said that. I look up to that idol so much! I even met the artist and he/she was really nice to me and even shook my hand. I know she/he only said it towards the haters…but I feel like it's how she feels about any overweight person including the fans. How should I perceive this? I really still want to look up to this artist 'cause their music really does give you the confidence to be a 'better' you. And as well not to listen to people that hurt you…What do you think I should think of this?
