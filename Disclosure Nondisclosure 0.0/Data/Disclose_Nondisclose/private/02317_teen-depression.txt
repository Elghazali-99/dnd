hello. its me again. i am having a couple questions. i've recently been looking up bipolar and i have found out that alot of what it has to say describes me. mostly because the racing thoughts. but i've also been looking up things about schizophrenic people. and it seems to tie in with what i have. my mind stays racing 24/7. i feel out of it all the time. somedays i feel like i different person. i cant sleep without having wild vivid dreams and i wake up from an 8 or 9 hour sleep feeling tierd. i think aobut hurting others and myself alot but id never act on it. its just thoughts. i really want to get to the bottom of this and i need help on what you guys think i have. schizophrenic does not really tie in because i dont hear voices i dont think people are out to get me and i dont really have delusions or see things or hear things that arent there. it jus feels like my life is a movie. and everyday is just like the next. i'm just worried because i feel like this everyday and everyday it feels like i'm going to lose my mind. it might just be anxiety or depression but i dont know what my problem is. i really cant concentrate at school and i cant keep my mind focused at all. i recently read an article about anti deprassants making you feel like this after you stop taking them (withdrawl) but i'm not to sure. 
if someone could give me something to relate to this or something i would love it. any advice can help. i just feel like i'm going nuts or i already am crazy.
