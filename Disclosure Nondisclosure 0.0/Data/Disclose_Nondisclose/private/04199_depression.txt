I am on day 8 of taking these meds, along with some High Blood Pressure meds (Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide).
 My question is, how long until I notice the effect of these meds?  Every day has been just as anxiety-filled as when I first started them!  The anxiety I have is stemmed from feelings in my body.  For example today at lunch I walked over to the Restaurant, when I got there I got this horrible fear that I wouldn't be able to talk when I opened my mouth, but I could!!!  Then it went to the feeling that I wasn't in control of my fingers and legs.  So I'm constantly evaluating myself to make sure my body is working the way it should be.  Last night I went for a walk before I went to bed and slept fine, but when I woke up...the evaluations started and eventually worked myself up again!!!  I just want to scream and cuss because it's so damn frustrating feeling out of control!  On top of that, life is happening.  Tomorrow my son has his circumcision, and other things are going on.  And here I am trying to mask everything I am feeling to not worry my wife and kids, and it's becoming so damn difficult that I just want everything in my life to be the way it was a month ago..2 months ago..any other time than right now!!!!
 I typed more than I had planned, but if anybody has any input or advice for me, please respond.  Thank you!
