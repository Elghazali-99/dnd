Okay, so I started getting my period about 3/4 months before the problems started. Everything was normal- they were as expected ect
But after a few months I noticed that my period was extremely early, usually it would come around the middle of the month but for some reason it came around the start of the month.
After that, my period stopped altogether, the first month I just thought I was late- but it never came, same with the second and now its the third time. So I'm a lot more worried as I thought the first two times was nothing and that I'd get it the next month.
Now I've said that, let me clear something up- I've never had sex (I'm thirteen years old of course I haven't)
I've never even had a sexual experience of any sort (IM THIRTEEN)
 I don't know what to do, because I think this really is serious. I have nobody to go to that I can trust (My mum is dead and the only person I can talk to is my stepdad but he wouldnt understand and it'd be a waste of time and an extremely awkward situation)
I'd like to go to a doctor or something but I cant really set something up by myself.
 Please help me? I just need some information and advice on what I should do...
