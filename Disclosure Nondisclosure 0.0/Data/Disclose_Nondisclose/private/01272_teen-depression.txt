I'm a 16 year old girl, and I feel completely trapped by everything and everyone, including myself. I'm not the person that I want to be. I want to be a person full of confidence, to feel loved, and to love myself for how I am. Ive Been with my boyfriend for 6 months now, and I absolutely love him, but I have trust issues because of my past... I easily get jealous of other girls he hangs around, and I always assume the worst when he's around them or even talks about them. I know they're just friends, but it makes me feel bad about myself. My parents also don't help with this... They're always on my case for the littlest things. It's almost like they want to pick a fight with me all the time. I hate it, cause I always end up being the one in the wrong. I feel like I can't escape all of these feelings and events, and they're all just crashing down on me all at once. I've been becoming very depressed lately on the inside, showing no one how I truly feel in the outside. Please, I really need help... I've been considering suicide, or cutting just to get away from it all. I know it's wrong, but i'm really starting to feel like it's the only way out..
