I have been taking Paxil/Seroxat/Paroxeteine for 8 years. 
Earlier this year I undertook a reduction plan from 30mg. I attempted this before dripping from 30mg down to 20mg. I got some serious withdrawal effects so was reinstated to 30mg by my GP.
I have, with the help of my GP managed to get down trouble free to 20mg.
I have been really ill with the flu for the last 3 weeks and have a horrible chest infection. 
I have not taken any meds for the last three weeks.  Stupid this may be but I was ill they were the last thing on my mind.
I also had only taken 1 15mg doe in the week prior to that. Not sure why this happened either, Can we put it down to a bad memory etc.
I am still suffering from the fallout form this flu and still cannot discern this from the paroxetine withdrawal. So this may be a bonus. 
My question is....having effectively gone "cold turkey" from this drug how much longer can I expect to have to put up with further withdrawal issues, i.e. have I done the worst of it now.
