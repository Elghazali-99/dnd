I am going through a break up with my sons father. We were together for 6 years and have a 3 year old son. We did not have the best relationship. Many ups and downs, when it was bad, it was terrible. I down talked him a lot and vice versa. The abuse became physical, but we stayed around, trying to work it out a day at a time. We broke up many times, every time, I left him. He would beg for me back, cry and full of regrets, I would do the same. It always turned out the same. There was history of cheating and hard to trust amongst both of us. I love him so much and I know he feels the same. However, this breakup is different. I moved back in with my mom, son lives with me. He is dating someone , or more than one woman and he is completely different now. He doesn't call me, try to get me back the way he used to. I know it sounds pathetic that im waiting for him to do it and he shows that he doesn't give a ****. I am in therapy once a week for my issues because of this relationship. After I leave the therapy, I still feel the same way. I work, have school plans but I cant see myself living without him and he already started a new life. I don't have many friends anymore so I rarely have things to do socially. I miss him but he seems not to care. I also might be pregnant again and he says I am making it up to scare him . He just is completely different, letting go of us and I don't know how to handle this or what to think. Im so scared he will love someone else and forget about loving me.
