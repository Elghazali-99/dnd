Every so often i get this shock through my body, its like a really horrible feeling and it makes me hate every person i know (it only last a few minutes), it use to feel like just a feeling when i was in primary school but know its turning more into a voice, its a man telling me to hurt myself and to hate everyone i love, I cant control it and its he worst thing in the world. I am know suffering from depression because of this. And i have self harmed myself.
        I also feel like when ever i am in the street every person is looking at me and laughing or talking about me, because of this i hardly go out any more. I find it hard to concentrate at school and know all off my grades are dropping, i have hardly any friends as i find it really hard to talk to people, i am very unsociable, i am very paranoid and i feel so alone. I always feel that there is something out to get me, i cant hang my arms or feet off my bed, im always scared to look behind me, im scared to look through the shower door when im in the shower. I sometimes see this man that speaks to me in my head, it is the most scariest thing i have ever experienced.  I have seen a doctor about this and i find it very hard to talk about my problems in person, i have an apointment with a psychiatrist at the end of April. I was just wondering if anyone could help me out, does anyone know what this could be, and also what kind of questions do psychiatrist ask?, Thanx
