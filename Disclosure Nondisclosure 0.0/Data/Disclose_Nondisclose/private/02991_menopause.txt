I am a 54 yr. old post menopausal lady who is on Divigel hormone therapy. I've had a complete hysterectomy. 
My question is WHY AM I HOT ALL THE TIME??? I don't have hot flashes anymore. Maybe 2 a week. This being hot all the time started about 12 yrs. ago, when I started having pre menopausal symptoms. The Dr. started me on the hormone therapy way back then to treat my hot flashes and it worked but I was still left with an over heated body. My bloodwork is fine, my hormone levels are fine. SOMETHING has to be causing this. In order to be somewhat comfortable I have to run my A/C all the time and it's set on 65 degrees. If I let the house get over 65 degrees then I'll start getting so hot and I'll start sweating......it's just AWEFUL. To make matters worse, I live in Florida!! If it wasn't for my family living here, I would've high tailed it out of here years ago ( heading north) but I can't bare to leave my mother, kids, and grandkids behind, and move states away so I can be comfortable. I would feel so selfish. I just have to find the RIGHT Dr...........Can anyone tell me what type of specialist I should go to?  I'll take any advice ya'll have as I am so tired of living this way.
