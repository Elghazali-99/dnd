Ok, i'm trying my best to stay calm but i'm so afraid my 5 month old daughter was molested today by a close friend. He was holding her while I was getting some things together at my work place and he had enough time to do something even though I kept checking to make sure she was ok. He's a good friend but he's one of those kind of creepy guys that stare off alot. Either way, I just got a weird feeling when I came out of the cooler and didn't see him with her. I checked up front and even outside but when I came back in he came out of the back room and I didn't think anything of it. So about an hour later I came home and changed her diaper and there was a very slight amount of blood on the wipe, only when I wiped in her feminine spot. I automatically got a bad feeling and made sure there wasn't any diaper rash. She hasnt had any in months so I know it's not that. I just feel like he might've touched her and I will probably take her to the dr but I hope they will still be able to tell because I gave her a bath. All I know is it doesn't feel right and there shouldn't have been any blood. I dont know if i'm just dramatically paranoid but her vagina even seemed to look a little different. I hope i'm wrong but I need some kind of advice. She's too young to show any emotional signs or anything but i'm losing my mind wondering. Please help if you can!
