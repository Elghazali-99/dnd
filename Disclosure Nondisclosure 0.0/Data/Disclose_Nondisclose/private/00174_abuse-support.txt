How do I break the cycle? I was brought up by a mother who was very controlling. She was a single parent and I am now co-dependent on her as an adult.I experienced Anorexia, depression and severe anxiety most of my life. I am now 27.
  I feel responsible for her pain and she won"t be there for me through my own suffering, as she says I have put her through enough...Her! If she only knew how much I with-hold information just to protect her...
 She will only be there when I ""do as she says". I am ignored in my greatest times of distress and feel I need her to cope. I only want a hug. A shoulder to cry on - nothing more. She abandons me when I need her the most. I feel unworthy, unloved and she has made me believe she is the ONLY ONE I can rely on or if I don't do what she says I am a failure. Nothing I do or say os good enough. Please help. I feel like I am worth nothing. I am going through a lot at the moment and feel trapped, distraught and extremely guilty for upsetting her. I also feel unlovable as she has abandoned me once again when I need her the most. I am going through a marriage break-up, and have 3 kids under 6....I just don't know what to do any more. Thanks,
 Gracie
