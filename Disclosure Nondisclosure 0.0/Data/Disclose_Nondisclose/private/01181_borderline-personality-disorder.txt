I am a 41 year old female who was diagnosed with Panic Disorder at age 19. Lived with it for 5 years until I almost had to go on disability. Then tried Prozac ans wham! I was feeling so much better. I took prozac for 7 years but was severly depressed and had no energy. Then we went on a 25 medication search for some relief. Cymbalta worked but not great. Then I saw another doc and we dabbled in the mood elevating drugs and anti=psychotics. Nothing worked, side effects too bad even at the lowest doses. the latest fiasco was Abilify (4mg a day). It made me feel great but gained 40 pounds in 5 months and was hot and sweating all the time. I had to change my activities but I didn't associate that with Abilify. Now I'm 7 days off Abilify, moody and unhappy, chills, not good. The doc has me on Geodon start at 5mg for 2 weeks and work to 10-(have to dump capsules). My only problem now is awful diarreah in the am. Will it go away if I stick with it? I've lost 7 pounds already but the diarreah keeps me from working. I'm VERY sensitive to meds. Even tried medicating myself with hydrocodone for years 40 pills a day-felt great  but had to detox with suboxone. Don't recommend!!!!!  What is wrong with me, please help, some days just want to die but have a child and he needs me. Will I ever be happy? I don't meet bipolar criteria except for tired & sleeping for days at a time. Can't work and am running out of money. I even have to live with my ex-husband to have a roof over my head. Even the docs are at a loss. What meds help & how do I get a diagnosis? Thank you so much for reading this!
