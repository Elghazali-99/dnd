For the last year I have been on meds for depression and anxiety.  I've started drinking pretty heavy.  Only beer but like you all say alcohol is alcohol.  The thing is I didn't drink when my children were young and my brother passed away 2 years ago of colon cancer.  It was very hard watching him go.  My biggest problem is that my husband consantly harps at me about my drinking even though I have done very well the last 2 weeks.  However, he took a huge cup with Mt. Dew and hard liquor on a trip and packed beer "for me".  I didn't ask for it.  Last night he said lets for a drive and packed beer again.  Then later that night he asks me what drives me to drink the way I do.  I kind of feel like he is setting me up to fail.  He said I should go talk to someone but I don't think he realizes that if and when I do that our marriage of 27 years will probably be over.  He find fault with most things I do around the house from cleaning to cooking.  He has a huge "beer belly".  He talks about my "drinking problem in front of me around our friends"  I even heard one of them say that my husband was an enabler but it went right over his head because he can't possible be the reason.  He partied and I do mean partied most of our marriage while I stayed sober and responsible.  I just don't know what to do here.  I know I need help but I feel like I'm getting blocked.  He even says I'm on "nut pills"  Is that being supportive?   
I would appreciate any thoughts.
