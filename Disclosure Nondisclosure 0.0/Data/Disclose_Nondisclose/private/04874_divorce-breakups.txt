Okay i feel like i have a problem that i cant control, well.... As hubby an i are taking steps to divorce. Im the one leaving (as other post states, i cant handle how he treats me, we have no trust for each other) yesterday we met up at the park so we can see the kids and spend time with them (he has our son with him- i have our daughter with me) he keeps bugging me to come home for one last night of "fun" half of me doesnt want to half of me does (i feel like he has this pull on me, to where he knows all the right things to say.. which makes me give in) i have always had a hard time telling him "no" ... i can i be more firm that its over. he see it as we both equally hurt each other an is wondering if all this is for real or a punishment.. of course its real.. ughh he is messing with me head!!! im starting to feel crazy, an i know if i keep talking to him im going to start to miss him, an what i'd hope to have an help him so we could have a normal family... but i know our relationship is far from normal. I only talk to him, bcz he has our son an i dont want him or anyone to think, i dont care or want to see our son. bcz i do!!! i just want to be left alone for awhile til i can talk to a conselor... how do i go about tell him?!?! im so lost....
