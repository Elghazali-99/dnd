I have seriously considered divorcing my husband because of his lack of ability to keep a job.  He either gets fired from or quits every job he gets, some very good ones.  I am working right now, but don't make very much and we have two children. He quit a very good job he had last week because the boss "disrespected" him - he just WALKED off the job, again a good-paying one, not easy to come by in our economy, because of this.  With the holidays coming, our kids needing things, etc.  I am very depressed about this and don't know quite what to do.  I have tried talking to him about it but every time he just blows up and says I only think of him as a paycheck, he wouldn't get mad at me for getting fired (yeah right), etc.  What can I do before this marriage ends?  Today is our 6 year anniversary and I don't want to scrap an otherwise OK marriage due to this issue.  And we CAN'T afford counseling because of no insurance - how can you afford medical insurance or out of pocket counseling when hubby won't work?  Thanks for all advice.
