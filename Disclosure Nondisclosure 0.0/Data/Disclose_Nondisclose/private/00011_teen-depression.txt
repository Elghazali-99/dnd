I haven't done this but I need help. I am only 14 and a freshman in high school and I feel things that I am pretty sure is depression. I don't want to tell my mom because, she might think I am faking. The only thing in my life that helps with this feeling is running track. But during the off-seasons where I cannot be near my team seems like an awful long time due to the fact that I just wish to die. I can't talk to my counselor in school, because I had sisters and brothers that went to her and she turned around and told my mom. I would suck it up and look forward to the future and what I dream about doing for the rest of my life. But I don't dream and I used to know what I wanted until I started running track, and got all confused. I am surprisingly good at track for never running before high school, I even got a varsity letter and went to states. However I used to want to be like my sister and work in the fashion business. Now I am not sure. All I want to do in the end is make my parents proud, run track and not feel this way. I want someone to tell me how I can stop feeling depressed and alone, when I am surrounded by loving people? And maybe why I am feeling this way. Please help!
