Heyya I'm 17 and well I just wanna know if I'm attention seeking ive been thinking about it a lot lately especially when my boyfriend said I am an attention seeker. I am a residential student at college and can be very lonely as I'm too scared to go out and talk to people so I stay indoors but being indoors keeps me from doing things and ever since then I have been self harming I know it's dramatic of me and stupid but I dunno what I can do I hate being at home and hate my family, I can be in a mood a lot from time to time over nothing and can be very paranoid about things easily and jealous. I don't mean to be a grump or shout at people and I really don't mean to be down in the dumps most the time. I am paranoid of socialysing and get a lot of angry thoughts in my head, and imgine arguements and get angry with myself for it. I do sometimes wish a lot of bad things happen to me though I am very much afraid of dying but wish I was dead sometimes. And really have no positive thoughts about anything am nothing but negative. This is probably just me being me but I just like to know so my boyfriend and dad might stop thinking I'm an attention seeker or depressing.
