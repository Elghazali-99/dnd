I was sooooo stressed out(not that I'm not stressed now) but its not as bad. So this really isn't a stressed out post. So at the beginning of the month I was having so much trouble enrolling my youngest two boys in school. I joked that it was the cia because thats how hard it was to do being as though I'm living with family members,they wanted to see this and that and the 3rd,nothing I showed them was good enough. But today September 28,2012 I finally got them enrolled! Thank God. So they missed a whole month of school because they are so particular about what papers are acceptable and which ones aren't. I had no problem enrolling my oldest 3 different school,same school district,same rules. I dont get it. Anyway my boys start Monday. Im happy about that. Still looking for my own place,working on it hard. Living with ppl is not my cup of tea not at all!!! My fianc√© and I are getting along a lot better. I talked to him about my disconnection feeling,and not snapped at him although I need snap at him at a later time about a house situation,but apolpgized for it later. He has a lot of stress lifted off his shoulders also is less distant with me. I'm learning to communicate better, I haven't seen a therapist yet, but I will I know I have a long long long way to go. But as of right now I'm happy a lil hungry (lol)but I'm happy. Can't say how I'll be in a few hours bus at this moment I'm content. And yes I just had to share. :~}
