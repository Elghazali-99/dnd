After a 2 years relationship she left me, made several suicide attempts, and went with several men. I decided to stay around and help her (morally, I encouraged her to see doctors, etc.). As she was getting better, she told me that she believed she loved one of the men she had been with, although he treated her bad and made her feel worthless, etc.
 2 months ago, that man made her feel so bad that she attempted suicide again. She got interned in hospital for a few weeks. When she got out she told me she was stronger, would not go back with that guy nor let anyone treat her bad again. She also told me she had always loved me deep down, and wanted to see me again soon, to see if it was possible rebuild something.
 However, 3 days ago (after a week during which I had not given any news) she wrote to tell me that she was sorry for lying to me, that she loves that man and only sees me as a friend. She told me she wanted to cure herself to have the opportunity to have a long term relationship. She asked me to stay around but as a friend.
 I don’t really know what to make of it…is it that after some hesitation she really decided to make her life with that man? Or could she be in a new downside? or could it be a test to measure my love?
 If I ask it is because I love her and wish to be with her, but if what she wants really is my friendship, and if my friendship can help her, I will do my best to give it to her. However, before killing my love for her, I would like to be as sure as posible, as I strongly believe that once I do, there will be no way back.
 I might get some posts about being a rescuer, or saying that everybody must take care of its own ****. But she really is a fantastic person, and I believe that given the circumstance she did her best not to hurt me. So unless it is counterproductif to her, I will keep trying to help her.
 Thx for any comment, advice, you may have
