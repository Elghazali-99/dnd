I was recently on paxil for anxiety until I realized all of the side effects that I was getting including gaining weight. I talked to my doctor and he said I could wean myself off. I was taking 20 mg. He said 10 mg for 2 weeks and then 5mg for 2 weeks, after start wellbutrin. However, I didn't make it that far. Just by one week of going Down to 10 mg I was vomiting, running to the bathroom. Nervousness, dizzy, brain zap and a fuzzy feeling in my head, sweating, VERY emotional. I called my doctor and he said I could start the wellbutrin, so I did and stopped paxil. I was still sick after taking wellbutrin for 4 days i understand it takes a while to kick in. Then that's when he told me i should take welbutrin and Paxil together for a few days and then once I feel better stop taking the paxil. That just doesn't sound right to me, you are going to feel better when you take something you're withdrawing from but get sick again once you stop. So right now I'm taking the wellbutrin 300 mg. I've been off paxil for a week, so the worst has passed. But i still feel horrible. Nausea, anxiety, poor appetite, diarrhea, dizzy. I still have to function working midnights. I was told these symptoms will go away eventually, but my question is there anyone out there who has had switched from paxil to wellbutrin and had the same side effects from wellbutrin, and how long did it last.
