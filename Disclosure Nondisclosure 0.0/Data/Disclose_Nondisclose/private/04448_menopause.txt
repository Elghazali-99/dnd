I am 55 yo. Have been experiencing menopause symptoms for about 3 years. Did the blood test route, etc., took whopping doses of Viatmin D and got put on Premarin, the lowest dose. I did not do well on that. I became actually worse, emotionally and it didn't help the sweats, irritability or anything. My doctor told me to try Estroven, and it's better, but I still feel like crap. I don't sleep well at all, I am irritable and snappish and that is NOT my personality. A friend told me she was in a similar state and took bio-identicals. She didn't go into details, but said they helped. Anybody know how I go about getting these, evidently they are not presciption drugs. I am kind of at the end of my rope. I slept all day today because I just felt so lousy..and that makes me feel worse. Luckily my job is very felxible and it is not affected by my lousy moods..but my hubby is ready to kill me. He thinks it's all in my head and to "snap out of it". Help, anyone?? (I am on 100 mgs of Zoloft for GAD (down from 200), have been for years. Also Klonipn for the GAD and I hate taking either/both. Have worked my fanny off to lose 30 lbs in the last year....still could lose another 30, but it's so depressingly slow. About ready to throw in the towel on this, and need some support!
