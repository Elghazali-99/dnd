I was sexually abused starting at around the age of 5 and it lasted till I was 12. It was brought on by an older step brother and was not a bad experience. It was actually very pleasurable. While this was happening I was also being physically abused by my step mother....neither one knowing what the other was doing. At that time all I knew was the physical abuse felt bad and the sexual abuse felt good. However I am now in my early 30's and have never really found my sexual identity through the years. For the most part I always went for older guys. I realized a couple of years ago that I was stuck in a cycle of reliving my sexual abuse. Since then doors have opened up for dating women and I now have a desire to be with women at times but there are still times that I think about men. Almost like jekyl and hyde. I almost feel like since the door was opened for me then there is no going back. Could I be bi-sexual, or maybe still havent dealt with certain sexual abuse issues. I get turn on by both sexes. Confused...Would be helpful to hear from other guys who have had similar situation.
 I had this posted in a different forum..thought I would move it over here
