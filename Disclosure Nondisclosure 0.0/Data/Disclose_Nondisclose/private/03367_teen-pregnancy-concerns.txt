Hi all! 
iv'e been having drama for a few months now, for three months in a row my periods have started on a normal flow for a couple of hours, then spotting and the next day its brown discharge and by the next day it has stopped completely.The start of this month I have felt really exhausted, dizzy, loss in appetite, pale in the face, i go to bed to sleep and im tossing and turning for hours before i fall asleep. a week ago my right nipple was very itchy for 3 days but soon went back to normal. AF is due to visit me on the 23rd on January. so 6 days to go! yesterday i started eating more again, and experienced milder AF cramping on and off, today I still have cramping and back ache on and off that is causing a lot of discomfort. 
I am trying to conceive, me and my partner have regular intercourse every 2-3 days. I have been trying for over a year now. went to the doctor to tell him that im worried if i have infertility problems, i have an appointment for an ultrasound on the 24th of this month.
Im just wondering if any one has experienced these same problems and have indeed been pregnant or have a clue what might be causing my discomfort! 
 baby dust to everyone ttc! xxxxxx
