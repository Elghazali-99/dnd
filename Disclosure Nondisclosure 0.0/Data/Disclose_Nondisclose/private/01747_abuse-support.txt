please can you help. I grew up with a loving but also physical and emotionally abusive mother. She seemed to be angry most of the time. There was often violence or the smell of violence. My father was lovely yet distant and found refuge in alcohol.  To cope with the  stressful hurtful home-life I began to tear my skin. I needed to bleed. My mother brought me to so many dermatologists to get to the bottom of it, but I always had the shameful secret that I was doing it to myself. When i grew up i left, got far away as possible and maintained a false happy interaction with my family. Lately my mother has been unwell and we are more in contact than ever before. she is kind and good to me, but i feel so much resentment for all the horrible emotional and violent scenes i remember from childhood. I feel she damaged me very greatly. And i have started to  tear my skin and bleed again. My legs are covered in scars. I can't seem to stop. I don't know what to do. I hope you can advise me... 
thank you
