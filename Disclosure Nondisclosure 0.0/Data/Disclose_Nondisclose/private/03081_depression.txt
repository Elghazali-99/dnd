About 5 months ago, I was told by two different doctors that I probably have some sort of depression.  One of which actually gave me a script for wellbutrin which I've not had filled. I thought I could control it myself, with diet, exercise, mediation etc.....well I'm still not feeling well, and it's been progressively getting worse again.  I feel like I've always suffered from some type of anxiety or depressive disorder, since high school. I'm now 39. 
 My symptoms sort of come and go, but there's always an underlying sense of sadness and lack of self worth.  I have little to no self esteem, I have a hard time looking in the mirror most days. And I wouldn't say I'm suicidal, however, I do have times when I think I'd be better off dead. My husband thinks it's all in my head and I do it to myself, so he's no help at all.  And unfortunately, it doesn't take alot to get me into a full blown breakdown... I function okay most days, but I do have days where I'm very weepy.  I'm always very easily agitated and I find myself being withdrawn from family and friends. I've not been to a councilor or psychiatrist.  Should I go on the pills and see if they help?  If I chose to do this, how long before I can tell whether or not it's working?
 I guess I'm wondering what I should do now?
