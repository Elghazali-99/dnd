Hi Everyone,
 I just wanted to let you know about a book my family doctor recommended to me.  I have been having really bad physical symptoms, which she believes to be psychosomatic.  She thinks it is stress, and that is manifesting in more of a physical way.  Although I do hope she is right, I am undergoing tests just to rule out any major illness..
 Anyway, the book is called Mind Over Mood.  It is a cognitive behavioural therapy workbook, and I just started today.  It is EXCELLENT.  I just got through chapter 1, and already it has allowed me to pinpoint major stressors andn environmental changes that have occurred in my life recently, and has shown me the cycle of my reactions.  
 For anyone experiencing stress, anxiety and depression, I would highly recommend this workbook.  It is something you can do on your own, and you can really take something away from it in order to understand what you are going through.
 The authors are Dennis Greenberger and Christine Padesky.
 Hope it helps you!
