I was on ativan for anxiety or for what I thought was anxiety.I told my doctor I kept seeing things and that I just couldn't go to school because I was afraid of getting on the bus because everyone kept staring at me and I was afraid something horrible was going to happen. Like the people were setting me up. He said "its all in your head you want to end up working at mc donalds? all you need is ambition". He said I needed a psychiatrist and him and his nurses just kept laughing and looking at me thinking I'm a freak. So he didn't give me any medication and I had horrible withdrawal symptoms. Got ativan again but still feel very out of it. I was walking my dog and I swear I heard my ex boyfriends voice and just felt like someone was following me. I called a psych. but I felt like they weren't taking me seriously. I feel very paranoid, hate going outside, I do believe people are plotting against me and that my boyfriend tries to trick me and that anyone I tried talking to just went off and told everyone else. No one gets it and no one even tries to help. Everyone just stays away. I feel like a prisoner of my own mind. Tired of people praying for me or telling me to just get over it. Sorry to burden anyone reading this. But how do i tell a psych. how I feel and have him take me seriously...I think he's just going to tell me "It's all will power or in my head". 
Wish I could go back to being happy and outgoing, just want to be normal.
