I am a single mom of a 15 year old son, along with 2 daughters who are 12 and 13. My son lived with his father until 10/2009 when he moved in with me and the girls. The decision was court ordered after my son admitted to noticing strange behaviors from his Dad and possibly suffering mental abuse caused by his Dad. We later learned that his Dad is bipolar, suffers depression along with other medical problems. Prior to telling what was going on, my son spent summers and every other weekend with me and the girls. We had, what I thought, a very close relationship. Upon moving from his Dad, he has totally blocked out his Dad and no longer speaking to him or seeing him. He went from being an A student and playing basketball to completely failing and barely any interest in sports. I'm afraid he is depressed but even more afraid to approach him with getting help. As I feel this will cause him to completely close up to the idea and the suggestion may make things worse. I'm torn by what to do and do not want him to suffer any longer. His Dad and I have fought a custody battle for several years, my son always wanting to live with me. Now that the battle is over and my son is with me, it seems like the entire ordeal was just too much for him to handle. I don't know what to do.
