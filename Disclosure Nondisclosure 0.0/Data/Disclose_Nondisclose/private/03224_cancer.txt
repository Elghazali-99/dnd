I am a 23y/o 5'8" 155 lb. non-smoker, and have been experiencing frustrating throat issues recently. I am a long distance runner and the first thing I experienced was SOB on high exertion. When that started (about 2.5 months ago) my anxiety peaked and I started feeling everything from chest pain to dizzyness to full blown panic attacks. My anxiety is under control, but my throat has been increasingly sore lately and my troubles with exertion are still an issue (I do not feel as in shape as I was this summer). Along with my sore throat I notice mild hoarseness..my voice is deeper than usual, and I cannot sing/yell very well. I also clear my throat often, but mostly after eating. Nothing seems to help these symptoms other than, strangely enough, eating. When I am eating I feel fine, then symptoms come back shortly after. 
 I've been seeing a doctor and did a Spirometry test on a suspicion of asthma. It came out looking very normal (to the technician and my doc.), but a lung specialist said it suggested a variable intrathoracic upper airway obstruction, but with no airway limitation. My doc has now referred me to a speech therapist for possible VCD in two weeks. 
 I trust my doctor, but symptoms have gotten worse this week and I now have a feeling of something stuck in my throat/tightness. Should I contact my doc. about doing some additional tests? I'm terrified of cancer.
