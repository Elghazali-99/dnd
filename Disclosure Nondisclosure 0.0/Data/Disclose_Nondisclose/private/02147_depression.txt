I am concerned my friends 13 year old told he "He wants to go be with the Devil and do his work." He stated he does risky behavior hoping to end his life, that he wishes he could choke himself. He hurts himself as that makes him feel better. (He cut his self twice, once with a razor then with a knife.} He has taken a knife out of a drawer and took it to my friend (his grandmother) and asked her to "end" him. I told my friend and her reply was "he has said that before." It is as if she is in denial over the situation. She has filed the papers to adopt her grandson, I am not sure that is in his best interest. He is being treated for ADHD, ODD, and PTSD. He is heavily medicated, his night pills put him to sleep within an hour. Example last night he was told to give back some linoleum knifes he had found in the garage. He refused and walked away from the home then went into the woods behind the house. Now she said it was fine as he gave them to her later in the evening. The only time he acted properly was after I talked her into sending him to boot camp. Now she is giving him and I Pad and wants to get him a cell phone. Does anyone else think this is insane?
