I am 33 and my wife has just filed for divorce but I want to try at all costs to save my marriage.  She found out I was having a gay affair for two months, and prior to that had been making friends in the gay community for 5 months (without any sexual contact).  This would seem to be an open and shut case, but my infidelity stems from a long held childhood secret that no one ever knew until I had to confess it to my wife.  I was sexually abused by two boys when I was 9 years old.  I was not a popular kid and my parents had just gotten divorced.  One of the popular boys invited me over to join his froup of friends one day.  Two of the boys (aged 10 and 12) started touching me and kissing me.  I didn't know what to do so I went along It proceeded to oral sex.  I was told if I ever told no one would ever like me and my parents wouldn't love me anymore.  I went back over 50 times to the sexual contact over two years.   I had shame, guilt, and self-loathing ever since.  I have had attraction to girls and guys ever since but never acted on it with guys.  I fell in love with my wife and married 7 years ago.  We had a happy marriage until we found out she was infertile.  She withdrew sexually and I eventually withdrew emotionally.  I didn't understand how the infertility had truly affected her.  I pushed and pushed for intimacy but she was unable to recover for two years.  by that time I had withdrawn emotionally.  I couldn't put my demons of my childhood abuse down any longer and I acted out in the way I learned as a kid.  Now that I have had to come clean, I realize why I did what I did.  Freeing myself of the abuse has freed me of the self-loathing, but my wife does not believe she can be attracted to me again.  I don't believe I am gay and want to save my marriage.  What do I do?
