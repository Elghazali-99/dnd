I hope this finds you having a good day.  In case you're not (I wasn't, but the day is early yet), I came across this today, and I enjoyed it so thought it was worth sharing.  http://www.upworthy.com/having-a-bad-day-heres-46-powerful-things-you-should-really-hear
 Last, below is an exerpt from Wikipedia's amazing list of great or famous people who have struggled with severe depression reminded me that while life isn't about accomplishment, depression need not rob any of us of the hope and aspiration to do great things and live wonderful lives.  That feeling that the best part of live is over, is just a feeling, and one that nearly everyone has at some point. 
 Not so much a question, as I just thought this might encourage and offer some perspective for some who (if like me, often succumb to a narrow view caught up in my own head).

  This is a list of notable people who have, or have had, major depressive disorder. A number of well-known people have suffered from the disorder. While depression was sometimes seen as a shameful secret until the 1970s, society has since begun discussing depression more openly. Earlier figures were often reluctant to discuss or seek treatment for depression due to social stigma about the condition, or due to ignorance of diagnosis or treatments. Some historical personalities are presumed to have suffered from depression based on analysis or interpretation of letters, journals, artwork, writings or statements of family and friends.
