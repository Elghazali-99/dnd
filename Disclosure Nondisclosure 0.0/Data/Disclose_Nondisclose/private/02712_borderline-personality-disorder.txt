I have been living with my partner for 9 months, very soon after we started living together he became a very different person, or should I say, i saw a very different person.  It started with he being paranoid about me and other 'men', mainly my past relationships.  He would go on and on and on at me about it, even to the point of calling my a hoare.  I remember one particular week, 6 nights out of 7 he made  me cry with his ranting and verbal abuse.  There were days when he wouldn't speak, and if I asked him if he was ok and what was up he would simple get irritated with me.  He drinks, sometimes secretly hiding bottles of whiskey, when he drinks too much (which is not always very much) it is likely to trigger an emotional outburst and rage, this can go on for hours, I plead him to stop but at the time he thinks he is in the right.  The next day he is full of remorse.  it seems now I can not love him enough, I don't know how to love, I am egocentric and only want him for what I can get out of him and it goes on.  If a day goes by and I don't regonize a moment when he is in need of affection I am told I am lacking in emotion etc.  I truly try to do my best, it is never enough ! The last emotional outburst was on Friday evening, it lasted nearly 4 hours, i was sitting with my hands over my ears as I didn't want to hear the things he was saying about me.  He then left in the middle of the night and slept in his car in the woods. All this happened after a days silence and then 4 large whiskeys.  He came back the following night as he does full of remorse with that little boy lost look and trembling from top to toe, exactly the thing that he knows makes me crack.  However last night it didn't, last night I told him that I can do this anymore, today I suggested he needs help and god only knows I do.
