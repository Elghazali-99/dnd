I recently have found a small, marble size lump about an inch in on the inside of my vaginal wall. I started to research this type of lump, and found many women have had it, and that most often they are vaginal cysts, and need to be drained. There is no pain, but about 3 years ago, my period was irregular. For about a year it would either skip a month, or then come light, or one month come Very heavy, lasting 3 weeks. I received medical care for that month, as I became anemic. It continued to skip etc, so I went to the Doctor. This had been going on about a year or so, and they said, Let's do an ultrasound. So I had one done, and it was clean.. there was one small cyst, but nothing that was an inch in diameter or more, so they said it was nothing to worry about, and that sometimes your period can be irregular, w/no real cause at my age (I am 31 now, was 28 then.) So I was relieved about the ultrasound, and my period was regular from there on out. Came every month, stayed 5 days, and not heavy. So I guess I'm just nervous about this lump- I realize it could prob. just be a benign cyst..but I also read there are rare instances that it is vaginal/uterine cancer. I read the symptoms of that are irregular periods, but when I DID have those symptoms, for a year, the ultrasound was clear..no tumor, etc.  I am a person who worries a lot :( regardless.. I'm just very nervous about having this looked at.. I made the appt. , so it is soon, but has anyone experienced a small lump inside vagina before?? Any info or tips is greatly appreciated.
