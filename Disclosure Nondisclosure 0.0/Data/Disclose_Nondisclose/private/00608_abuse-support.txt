I come from a large family, to cut a long story short, we are all adults now, but for 13 years now one of my siblings are estranged as they sexually molested a few of my younger siblings, wish not to go into details. They were immediately eradicated from the family and have been estranged ever since! I only recently found out my parents had very limited contact with the person in question, and only this year my estranged sibling actually got in touch with me, told me they wanted to reach out as they have tried to commit suicide four times in the last year and wanted to tell me how much they love me!! I have kept contact via email only as I do not want my husband and own children or my immediate family as in my other sibblings finding out! I feel totally guilty and trapped about this and it is making me ill.. This evening was the final straw for me, when I received a message from the person in question and was told that they have been severely beaten up, left for dead basically and were lucky to be alive, and that they could not stop crying and wanted to just talk to someone from their family! I was horrified and got an awful shock, phoned my Father and he told me to leave it well alone and to just get on with my life, I am so upset, I had to respond to see if they were all right, even though I feel so bad for my other sibblings.. I am in a right pickle now and do not know what to do, I could not eat my dinner and have heartburn all day long because of it! I am so very stressed and do not know what to do.. Any advice will be very welcome, sorry for the long intro... Sunset.. but thanx in advance..x
