I am 37 and was working a great job economy screwed that up, now I have no full-time job. The creditors only want their money not really trying to help me. I hate that the only child my wife and I had died. My goddaughter is like my own as her family life is messed up I found out a month ago that she was Bi and took it hard, and watched that relationship come and go. Then this weekend I found out she has recently been having sex chats with a counselor at a group home that she was in 6 mths ago. I was furious and went over there to deal with it. He was fired but I talked to the cops and they said he would get off easy but my girls life would be turned upside down with investigations. So I told her mom and the matter was settled with him fired. God Daughter was furious at me because she is 14 and wanted an older man to flirt with. Then last night she got mad at me and ran away so she could go hang out with some friend of hers who lives 10 miles away, she ran at 10 at night. It turned out that she wanted to see the friends 20 year old brother, I got her back but she fought(Kicking and punching) me so hard that I had to restrain her in the middle of a street. This all has me so freeked, No money, may lose our home,my god daughter, nothing is going good now..I find myself snapping at everyone and thing. How can I calm down when my life is so full of painful things???
