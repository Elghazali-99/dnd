hi, i'm really concerned about my BPD. close friends and relationships--i always alienate those around me. when i feel them growing distant, or maybe i'm afraid that they are growing distant, i become desperate. i cry, i desperately try to contact whomever i feel is becoming alienated, i consider suicide...then it all stops and i become normal. but it's a recurring cycle, and i keep going back to it. recently i was not doing so well, extremely depressed, and i can tell that's alienating my boyfriend. now, i have this underlying fear that he'll leave me and it seems like i'm on thin ice--whenever i become this way, it's an obsession, an all encompassing thought--about him leaving me, but also about how everyone always has and that this is how i'm destined to live. the other side is an extreme apathy. but i'd simply like to enjoy things and people without living with this fear of abandonment. i am soon starting therapy for this that i hope will help, but in the meantime i wonder-- is there anything anyone can do, is there anyway, when you feel like you're going to throw a tantrum or become "crazy" and freak people out---is there any thing to control it? detachment, a way of changing perspective... a good book? and if you have Borderline Personality Disorder, do you think you can ever have a normal relationship? my current bf tells me that i have too many needs and he feels like he can't live up to them, esp. with his career. but i don't want to find someone who fulfulls my "needs" bc i don't want to feed this fear of mine. i want it to go away, and i want these needs to go away. any thoughts?
