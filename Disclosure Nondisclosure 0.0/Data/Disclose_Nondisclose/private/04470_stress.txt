Wasn't too sure what category this falls under but  this situation has made me really stressed. I am a 23 male healthy. When i was younger i fondled with another male because i was curious. However that was years ago. So Sunday my friends and I were watching the game and they decided it would be a good time for them to prank me. So my best friend texted me pretending to be a quote on quote "girl" that i have met 2 weeks ago at a bar. I kept asking who it was and wasn't too sure but also was in fear that it would be the same male that i messed around with. So it was an annoying guessing game. Thinking that it was who i thought it was i texted this mysterious number back "I just figured out who you were Anthony look i understand why your texting me but i cant man i have a girlfriend and im done with that life style i really appreciate you not bothering me but i'm really trying to change my life around" so then my friend pulled me aside away from everyone else and said it was him fooling around and what was that text about ? Pretty much he suspects im gay but im not im def neterosexual and this was a really embarrassing and awkward moment. What should i do ? should i continue to deny ? shrug and act like that never happened ? or should i lie to make it seem like it was really nothing like that ?
