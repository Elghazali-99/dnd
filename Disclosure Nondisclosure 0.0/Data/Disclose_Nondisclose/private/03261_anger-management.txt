Okay, just wanting some input here.  I tend to have anger issues, I guess.  At least, people say I get pretty mean, but all my moods change on a dime, I think.
 Okay, so here's the deal.  I'll go about my day, and be fine.  Bored, but fine, and something will **** me off and I'll snap at the person.  If they just take it and leave, I'm usually over it in very little time.  If they keep going or say something I don't like, I get very angry, and stay angry for a lot longer.  Slam doors. Slam things around.  Storm off.  I've been known to punch doors, one time I put a hole in it (It's a pretty light door), though I haven't done that in a while.  Sometimes I wanna throw things, though.   The only thing that's probably stopping me is that I can't go anywhere else, and I know they'll kick me out if I do.  So, if I do throw something, it's light, and something that'll probably make a lot of noise, but no damage.
 Other times, I'm pretty laid back.  Sometimes I just get in what they call a 'mood', where I laugh at literally everything, and probably am on the floor and just being generally weird.  Bouncing around, they think it's funny.  Other times I get really bored, and similar to the laugh-at-everything mood, but I'm a lot more obnoxious.  Tend to be like a child, with my mother pulling things out of my hands every five seconds. (I'll mix the salt and pepper, or pour it on the table and make designs in it, set toothpicks on fire with the stove, etc etc.)  
 Sometimes I just get in the mood where I wanna break things.  Not hurt anyone, but maybe smash a few plates on the floor and then sweep it up.  Apparently my grandmother used to break plates into the trash bin, so I'm not alone on this I guess.  I really like the sound of something breaking.  It's pretty satisfying. 
 I guess I just think that maybe this is a little bit off, and could use some controlling.  Any tips?
