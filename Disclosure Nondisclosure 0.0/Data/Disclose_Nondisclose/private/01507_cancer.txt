I'm 17 years old female , i've been having health problems for a a long time , but it wasn't as bad as it is now .
        It all started with chest pain , i was  only still a child , i had also fatigue and i was weak most of the time , still i am 5 years later i 'd get trouble breathing ( i still have it and it s worse ) , the followed year i felt so weak and it was coming from my heart , my chest felt heavy , couldn't walk for days , i went to the ER and they said it s all fine ..an other doctor noticed my swollen lymph nodes in my armpit ( the right one ) and that my spleen was a bit enlarged that the doctor could feel it , i also had a cough so he gave me antibiotics and iron tablets cause i was anemic . 
Now days i had more swollen lymph nodes ( both armpits , under my chin , and near my collar bone ) , that cough turned to " chronic cough" ( 2 years now) , i still have the chest pain , trouble breathing, dizziness , no appitite , my knee hurt and i also have abdominal pain , my spleen feels the same again ( it itches), my throat tickles making me cough and feeling like vomiting , low grade of fever , i throw up a lot  , my gums bleed often and recently i spit blood after coughing up .
I saw a doctor a month ago and something showed up on the ultra sound , they ordered an X-ray which was fine and showed nothing , the pneumologist said that i should do biopsy for my swollen lymph nodes ( i still did n do it ) , i was given an inhaler to help me breathe and many antibiotics that did n work  . I also saw a doctor for my kidneys , he said that my bothe kidneys are swollen  . 
Just a week ago i had  heart attack symptoms , i felt nauseated at first , full and my heart felt weak , heavy  , i ignored it and went to school ( i shouldn't)  ,  i had trouble breathing after that and kept feeling like throwing up so i left school  then i felt like fainting , i arrived home and went to bed , it felt horrible , my chest felt heavy , my left arm went numb , i couldn t speack . . but 2 hours later i felt better 
I can't live like this , just imagine someone my age having all this and still acting normal ..
what could it be ? i've read most of topics , that i know evey single symptome of each illness
