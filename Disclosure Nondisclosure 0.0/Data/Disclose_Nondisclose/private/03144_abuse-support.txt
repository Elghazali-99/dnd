Hi again,
I was just talking with my ex husbands most recent ex girlfriend. Oh god I wish so much that I had of had him charged because he did the same things to her and now he has left her with a 6 month old baby. She hasn't told anyone else about what happened to her but she felt a connection with me because we have been through the exact same thing by the same person. This is also bringing up alot of my own memories again. My counselor has been teaching me how to meditate and now that I am really good at it he wants me to use it to relive what happened to me so that I can deal with any feelings that I may have repressed. I want to try but I am so scared. Also my bf has been really patient and understanding with all this and now that he knows everything I feel like I am finally really ready to put this all behind me and just be completely open and close with him but I dont think I know how to do that anymore. All I want is to get through this and be the loving cheerful person that I used to be before all this happened. I know I deserve it and so does my bf. I hate that I cant be that person for him, I love him so much and I am still scared that he will leave me because it is taking so long. I know thats prob not true because he loves me very much but I cant help but worry. How can I get back to that trusting loving person again?
