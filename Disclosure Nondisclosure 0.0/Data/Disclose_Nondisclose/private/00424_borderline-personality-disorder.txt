i am 23 y/o.for the past 4 years i have been feeling different.it is getting worse and worse,and i am slowly loosing my friends and family over it.i have an extreamly bad,short tempure,i cant tollerate anyone,im fidgity,im on edge,im anxious and my mind is constantly going ten to the dozen.i have lost most of my family because of my tempure,i just cant tolerate anyone and i end up arguing with them,then after i regret it.its like i get in such a state that its like its not me speaking its someone else and i cant stop myself!the worst thing is my kids,im constantly shouting at my little boy,but i cant help it,its over stupid things aswel.i just feel rotten,and i know that something is not right,and if i dont sort it out ill loose everyone.iv lost friends because they come round to my house,and somedays im ok,but most of the time im horrible to them and say nasty comments and i cant stop myself from doing it!i feel so withdrwan from everyone,i dont know how to have i civil conversation with people anymore.im just wondering if anyone has anything similar to this,or mabey knows what could be wrong with me?im scared to go to the docs because i think they will fob me off and put me on anti depressants.any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.
