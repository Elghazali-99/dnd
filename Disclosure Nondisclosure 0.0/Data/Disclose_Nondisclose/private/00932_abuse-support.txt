So I found out today (at 18 years old) that my brother tried to molest me before I turned 3 years old. (He was 7 at the time.) As soon as my aunt informed me, the memory came flooding back. I do not remember everything, I don't remember him touching me. But I do remember him making me lay down in bed with him and moving my hand repeatedly toward his privates. My aunt said that my uncle walked in on him fondling me. I remember inappropriate behavior continuing until about the time I reached middle school... I found out tonight that it was the REAL reason I was taken away from my mom at such a young age, all these years I thought it was due to drugs... I even learned that my other brother got the blame for it because he was older (old enough to be charged) and was mentally handicapped and nobody believed my aunt and uncle that it wasn't him. He was charged with criminal sexual conduct and the real culprit got nothing. My aunt said he has always had some kind of obsession with me, always have tons of pictures of me in his wallet but none of anyone else.. I have always felt uncomfortable around him and still do, I have always had unexplained resentment towards him but never understood why... and now I do. It all started tonight because he kept looking down my shirt asking about a rash that I have from dry skin.. I was like why would you be looking there anyways? I also now realize why I was so afraid to become sexual with anyone for the longest time... While all my other friends were always talking about sex, I hadn't even kissed a guy yet because I was scared for whatever reason... It sickens me to know that not only has it happened several times, but that no one ever told me!!!...idk how to deal with this, am I overreacting with how upset it has made me tonight? Bringing up an issue that I wasn't even really aware of for the past 10+ years? I've been considering counseling for weeks, and this just makes me want to go even more..
