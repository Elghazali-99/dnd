I'm 20 years old. about a year ago i started having trouble with my familly so i started spending a lot of time at my friends house, we were already best friends but we got even closer. Her family considers me apart of them. I was supposed to go back away to my college but I couldn't afford it anymore, so i had to stay at home and go to a community college but it also meant i was stuck with my family. my family isn't terrible but they dont really treat me right, i do everything i can for them and they abuse it and yell at me and basically make me feel not apart of this family. so not being able to go to school, my best friend leaving for school and stuck with my family ended up with me going through a depression period. my friend kept urging me to talk to a professional but i declined and said it would pass it just a phase. It did pass it took several months but it past. then I had issues with my car that ended up stranding me at my friend's school and it kind of ended up bringing back the depression. it pasted again tho and i started working again(work seasonal jobs) and things have been pretty good. My friend still thinks i need help and is telling me to go to talk to someone. She told me I treat her like **** which i'm confused about because i'm the best friend she has, she herself admitted this. but throughout the year she would randomly ignore me or tell me she didnt' have time but make time for someone else, she would frequently stop texting me if i got upset. She refuses to talk to me about it. I told her i want to fix things and she says there is nothing to fix. I feel like i'm okay. sometimes i get upset easy and it usually has to deal with her but she is the closest person to me. Anyone got any ideas what i'm doing wrong? even tho i'm not depressed, should i go and talk to someone? All advice is GREATLY appreciated. Please :) Thank you in advance. I could really use your advice. I can answer any questions you have.
