I have been feeling detatched from myself for the past year, and I think I have diagnosed myself with " Depersonalization Disorder. " This abnormal feeling came to me the morning after I smoked marijuana with a friend, I'm sure it struck at around 10AM or so. Before this experience, though, I can recall a time when I was only a little bit younger, maybe two years at the most before the incident where I was at the beach for the day, and I had the same exact feeling, like I wasn't really there, or watching myself from outside my body. That feeling kept with me, but faded once I got back to my house and refilled my body with fluids. When I first smoked marijuana however, I got frightened the next day once the weird feeling happened, and had not smoked any more marijuana for about three and a half weeks to a month. After that, I gave up hope and just started smoking again. I know that is a very poor decision, and I have been suffering from it for the past year. But I have smoked marijuana recreationally every weekend for the past year, and have taken ecstasy about 8 times. As of last week I am no longer taking ecstasy, and have come to the conclusion of not smoking marijuana anymore either. Throughout this year, I have felt my heart rate pick up, and I started to feel anxious, but that feeling quickly subsided after I took my mind off of it. My question is, is will I ever feel complete again? Will quitting Marijuana make this " unreal " feeling go away? Thanks for any answers.
