I'm 13 year old girl I've been really upset the last few days, from about last summer I've started to notice women and how beautiful they can be, I don't fall in love with every single woman but with Kate Winslet,Katie Mcgrath, my PE teacher,my old maths teacher, and other odd women. I had these sort of odd feelings for them but they have gone now and they only lasted 2 weeks each , I felt sort of this lump in the back of my throat and I felt really sad ( I don't know why..) But a few days ago I went to a funeral which I knew an actress was going to which is my dad's cousin, and I was really excited because I wanted to ask her about meeting famous people and I was proud to have a famous person in my family , but the problem is that she didn't go because she was filming her new movie. I was really dissapointed but after a while I developped feelings for her mum who also came to the funeral, I loved her long curly brown hair, how she talked, how she smoked, how funny she was and what a down to earth person she was. I didn't feel to bad until I had to come back home and say goodbye to her... Since then I can't stop thinking about her , I cry every night and look at her photos on facebook . So at the moment I'm very lost and confused about who I am because I did have an enormous crush on my climbing teacher who was a man so I don't know if I'm lesbian or heterosexual.. ( by the way I DON'T WANT TO BE LESBIAN AT ALL !!) so please someone help me because I'm at breaking point...
