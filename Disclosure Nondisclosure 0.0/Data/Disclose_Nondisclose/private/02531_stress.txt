I have been suffering from nausea for last 2 yrs. Initially I used to have nausea for 5-10 minutes in the morning but now I have it almost everytime. Now the problem has became so big for me that even if I am not taking stress I still have this nausea. The thing is that I am such a big introvert that whenever I am told to go out in public like going to mall, market or meeting friends, relative or giving speech in school I have this problem. This problem becomes too big specially when I have my exams due to which I can't give my 100% in exams. 
                      Now that my college are opening in 1 month I am getting more nervous about this problem. However even though I have never vomited due to this problem but whenever I have this problem I feel that my throat muscles are going out of my control and have somehow got arrested. I showed my doctor who suggested me to take Librax and few more medicine but the problem hasn't ended completely. I am totally confused about what to do as whenever I think of vomiting nowadays, this nausea starts. 
         Eating bit unhygienic food also triggers this problem sometimes.
