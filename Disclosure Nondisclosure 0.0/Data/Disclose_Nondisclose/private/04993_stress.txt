Hi. 
   I came to know about it on the website. I have a strange problem and it keeps me depressed 
  all the time.I am 23 years old and a virgin still.It all happened a year ago when we were on
  on a tourist trip in a group in India..one night while I was sleeping a woman of age around
   50 nearly my aunties age was sleeping besides me. While sleeping she kept her hand on my neck
   I thought she must be in dreams. So I gently kept her hand off my body. But in a short while 
  she picked her saree she was wearing upwards. I was a sort of shocked and she was appearing naked 
  below her belly. Althought I could not  see clearly but I knew it. So I felt it and slept somewhere else.
   Now the problem is that image comes in my mind as it was night it comes in a black shadow.
   It has turned into an obsession when it comes it makes me tense and I am not able to forget it and also feel guilty whenever
    it comes. I dont know how to express it to somebody and feel heavy all the time.
    Cant remain happy. Whenever I go among friends I feel that I am hiding somethin from them
     and cant feel natural. Please help me out with a workable solution. I can even pay 
     for the advice if it clicks through western union money transfer. Please i need a good advice
     I am suffering for an year and even I took medicines for sometime but it didnt worked.
