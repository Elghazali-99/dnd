Hi, I have a random question.....
 Has anyone got any experience with bleeding while on Lamotrigine? 
 I have been on these Meds as a Mood-Stabiliser for 3 years. EVERY time I miss a dose, I will start bleeding the next morning.  I will even feel like I am getting my Period on that evening and by the morning I bleed. It is NOT my period, just random bleeding until I take the Tablets again. My Psychiatrist and Doc say that it's impossible because Lamotrigine has no effect on the woman's Hormones and that it must be a coincidence. But I swear it happens every single time I forget it! It’s happened like 20 times in the past 3 years so it is NOT a coincidence! 
 Also, I have tried to come off the Tablets so often but fail every time because I can’t come with the „period feelings“ as I call it! The lower dosage I take, the more I feel like I am constantly on my period. 
I am usually on 150mg, I have taken 100mg for one month and am now down to 50mg but I am bloated, I have that horrible pressure on my abdominals/stomach, my boobs hurt and I feel like I am going to get my period. I bet I will start bleeding tomorrow! It happens everytime! At this stage of ’coming off’ the Tabs, I usually just give up and take 150mg again JUST so that I feel normal again. But I don’t wanna do that this time because I am determined to give them up! That sounds like I’m addicted to them.... I’m not, it’s literally the fact that I can’t cope with this horrible period feeling ☹
 I am not on any other Tablets, no birth control pill or anything. Apart from Thyroid Tabs for hypo-thyroidism but that’s it so there isn’t exactly anything for it to react with. 
 If anyone else has some experience with this Drug then please let me know! 
 Also...when giving it up, have any of you lost or gained weight? I am scared that it will make me gain weight whenI come off it completly because it takes away my Appitite.
 Advice would be much appriciated! ☺ 
Thank you in advance!
