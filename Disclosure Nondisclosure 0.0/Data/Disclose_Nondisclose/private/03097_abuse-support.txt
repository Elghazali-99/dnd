I hate asking this, but I'm getting really scared.  I'm 20 years old, and two days ago I was sexually abused by my ex boyfriend.  I am a virgin, and I didn't get fully raped, but he put a gun to my head and made me do a lot of horrible things.  I don't really want to go into details unless it's necessary, and I refuse to tell anyone.  I feel like it's my own fault for still trying to be friends with him.  I knew he had anger problems.  But that's not why I'm posting this.  
 I'm scared because I've been bleeding just a little for the past two days since it happened.  My stomach hurts, but I'm still 2 weeks away from my period.  So it can't be that.  I am taking birth control pills, but just for cramps and acne.  So I don't always remember to take it, but I usually do.  Is there any chance that I might be pregnant or have some kind of STD?  If so, I'll probably still not tell anyone.  I'll just whither away and die in my room.  You have no idea what this has done to me.  I'm a virgin and a Christian, and I never wanted this to happen.  I'm so scared.  
 Is it normal to bleed after getting sexually assaulted?  Will I be fine in a few days, or do I have some sort of fatal internal bleeding??  I might eventually get over the emotional pain, but I don't want any physical problems to go along with it.  I'm a good person, and I don't want anything worse to come from this.  I just want to go on with my life and pretend it didn't happen.
