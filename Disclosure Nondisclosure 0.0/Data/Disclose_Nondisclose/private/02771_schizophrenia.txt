Hi there,
I've always been a bit of a worrier. Constantly worrying about things, perhaps a little bit of a hypochondriac. My mum has bad agoraphobia and I've always been worried I'd get it too. Recently, my parents have broken up out of the blue. It's really effected me and I'm scared of being home alone, rarely anyone is home especially at night. I'm very stressed, but I've been getting weird thoughts, visualizing something bad happening (e.g if a car swerves close to me, i may visualize it hitting us, and what would happen.) It's the same at home (only at night), I'm concerned that someone might break in. 
 I'm also often home alone working as i'm finishing my dissertation at the moment, so i'm rarely seeing people. When I do see people (other than my friends or boyfriend) I feel weird towards them, like scared that I'll have no control over what I do and might do something to upset them. 
 I honestly think I'm convincing myself something is wrong with me, I always do, but now I fear maybe I do have a problem because I've never been this way before and I'm getting these thoughts quite often. I'm also worried because recently I went to Amsterdam for a couple of weeks and smoked a lot of Marijuana, and I fear that it's sparked it.
