Hello. So I've been testing for cyclical cushings for a while and Dr says its not likely. Instead he wants me to start taking estrogen cream and progesterone cream because of borderline low estrogen and my menopausal symptoms of hot flashes, irritability, insomnia, fluctuating periods. He says I'm not in menopause but that its prob a pituitary issue. I'm a little concerned because I've had abnormal paps and thickened uterine lining that comes and goes and fibroids that have been getting slowly bigger, as well as mildly high can 125 for a few years. Is it safe for me to take this hormone replacement therapy if I'm not in menopause and still have all my parts, especially if I've had abnormal paps and an increased risk for cervical/uterine/enfometrious cancer? My periods have been stable the last few months but I usually have either normal or too close together periods. Maybe the meds will help but I think I have thyroid probs more on the hyperside but because I'll have an abnormal test but then a normal test, the abnormals are being considered flukes. Any ideas/suggestions. I'm so tired of chasing my tail.
