My husband and I are trying to reconcile out 8 year relationship, after a year of solid BS.  We moved to an intentional community, and all hell broke out.  He became verbally abusive, I became drunk, dissoulte, and less than faithful.  
 Fast forward 6 months.  We are ready to put our anger, hurt and pride aside.  Our relationship has a strong core, and we have a 5 year old who deserves two healthy parents.
 I left the community fearing for my sanity.  I was literally feeling 'lock me up in a padded room' crazy.
 One of the marriage counselor's we have come across practices Rapid Resolution Therapy, which is basically 4 hour block sessions of talk therapy, perhaps combined with Amen Bran Scanning.  The counseler is also a non advocate of standard pharmaceutical interventions (I am already on Zoloft and Seroquel, and am concerned that she would be unwilling to continue me on these meds.  But I have yet to talk to her about it)
 My main question is; does anyone have and real information about this Rapid Resolution Therapy?  All I find when I google is people trying to sell it, and very little first hand information.  Anyone with any first hand info would really help me out!
