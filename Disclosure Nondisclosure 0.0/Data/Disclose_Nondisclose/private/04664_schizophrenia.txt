I don't know what to do with myself. I've never dealt with anything like this before. I did take a psychology class that discussed it and I've been looking it up all day, but other than that...and now my niece, who just turned eighteen about six months back is now experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia. She told me how she stopped going outside and hanging with friends (she used to hang outside a lot). I feel like this links in with it. She also left her hometown to come live in another state with my dad and I. 
 We thought she was a bit strange, but I figured it was her eccentric personality or something. But now I realize she's hearing voices and she's telling them to "stop!" and "no!" she hasn't been able to sleep for two days and she' came in my room today going on about guns and someone getting her with a bullet or something. I don't know what they are telling her, but she's been praying and crying. I'm sick with worry out of my mind, and I'm the only one around right now...I don't know what to do...
