I've been having unprotected sex since January but i've had my cycle every month..Jan & Feb it came heavy for 2 days n then light for 4 days..March & April came 4 to 5 days earlier and really light..I have a very regular 28 day cycle...Been having really sore boobs but i always thought that it's because i don't have proper support. I have gained a little weight and my lower back and abdomen have this stabbing pain at times. when i go to the bathroom i feel pressure in my lower abdomen and i urinate a lot. I have a loss of appetite, somethings i love to eat or even smell turns me off really badly and give my headaches. When i lay on my tummy (stomach) i get a sharp pain which i have to move off and it eases up... 
I just finished my period 2 days now and I want to know when i can take a test? and what are my chances are of being pregnant? obviously because of the unprotected sex it's big but i'm having my cycle so im kind of confused and don't know what to think really..I've read that people still had their cycle when pregnant but it's not really their 'cycle'.....help pwease someone? 
 I know i posted the question twice -__- i'm new here so im a bit confuffled on how to post stuff sorry :)
