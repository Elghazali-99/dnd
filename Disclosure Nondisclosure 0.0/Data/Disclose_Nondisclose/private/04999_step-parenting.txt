My stepson, well stepson to be, actually, is REALLY messed up, right now. His parents split up ten years ago, when he was 6. I came into the picture about 4 years ago. 
 He grew up in a household of 4 girls. Now, his biggest problem is that ALL and I mean ALL of these he cares about (or care about him, in his own mind) are girls. Sure, they are sweet, good-natured, well meaning girls and women, but they are crippling him, and now, he has gotten to the point were he is EXTREMELY uncomfortable with ANY real male to male contact. 
 Just yesterday, he almost got into a first fight with me because I was trying to take his moms cell phone from him. He had just lost a chance at drum major in Highschool band, and he knew he wouldn't feel right until he went and vented to ALL his girlfriends. So, when I try to take "his" phone away, he reacts like an irate 2-year-old, who's just had his paci taken away. 
And now, he blames his mom for "making him miss his chance at the band" 
I could go on and on about his behavior and his extremely irrational, border line insane attitude, (he argues about the color of the sky) but this is t post, so. 
 The original points I was making, about the girls. Well, they are making things worse, even though hey are trying to help, and he and his mom are the only people he knows that realize this (which, of course, automatically makes us the enemy) 
Rrrrg, I wish there was a way for him to have a 3 month (or 6 month) detox from woman kind.
