Approx. 2 months ago my 40 y/o male friend, was diagnosed with either Cirrhosis or Liver Cancer. He wont tell me exactly only that his Liver is not working anymore. He has been a alcoholic for 20 years a smoker for 25+ years and does not shy away from hard physical work. I put him on to juicing (he has cut down alcohol by 70%) He has told me that he seems to feel better on it. He no longer vomits when he wakes up and his bowel movements have improved. Meaning constipation and diarrhea is less and the stool is a more normal texture. This week (Mon 16th June) he was sent to replace a co-worker (holiday) and is now doing a 100% fast-pace medium to heavy physical job as opposed to his normal 35% slow light physical job. I saw him for the first time since he started on Monday,  he was trying to mask the pain but i could see he was walking slowly, hunched over a bit and unknowingly protecting his liver area. I also found out since after the 1st shift  he has been urinating blood and blood coming out the rear and in the stool. What effect does physical work have on the liver/organs. He tells me he feels sore because he has to get use to this type of work again but i think he is doing more damage to his liver. I have never seen anyone with a pain tolerance like him, so if he is hunched over walking slow then you know something is wrong.
