I've had a girlfriend for the last two years who I love dearly and she loves me just as much. However there is a slight problem, we are both from two different countries and met while she was living abroad in my country. She recently returned to her home country where she was going to get abit more work experience In her field and I was gonna move over there to be with her and then the final plan was to apply for a visa for her and return to my country. However just before I started organizing to make my move over (only 3 weeks after we were last together in person) she told me that she didn't want me to move over there because she didn't want to leave again due to missing her family too much. I was completely shattered. Especially by the fact that she doesn't want me to even try to live over there because she knows that I won't be happy! I'm just completely lost now and feel clueless as to what to do. Do I hope that maybe she will change her mind as it's only been such a short period of time? Or do I let her go which will be extremely painful and such a shame.
