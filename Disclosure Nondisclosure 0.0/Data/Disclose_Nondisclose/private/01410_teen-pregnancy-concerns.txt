SCENARIO :
 She started giving me a hand job but i did not ***. I know in myself i did not *** because i did not felt it come out. So she touched a little bit of my precum
 Then she removed her hand in my penis and started tickling me for like 5-7 mins. So the precum was wiped on my clothes, my hair, and pants. Then i started giving her oral sex, then 5 mins later she checked if she is wet using her fingers (the fingers with DRY PRECUM)
 So then, after doing it, i decided to take her home. It took about 1 HOUR so the precum is probably dead.
 As soon as she got home, she took a bath and of course she handed shampoo, conditioner, soap, and water.
 After that, she said she fingered herself because she still has this "horny feeling."
 As i do research and sex ed stuff, i knew that if the man didn't ejaculate 72 hours before sexual *****, you are safe for the sperm is not that much in your precum.
 I am not ejaculating as always because i am too busy working
