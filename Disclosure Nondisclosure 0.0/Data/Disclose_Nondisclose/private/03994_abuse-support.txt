HI I'M A 46 YEAR OLD MALE. WHEN I GOT MY FIRST SUMMER JOB AT AGE 15 IN CYPRESS GARDENS IN WINTER HAVEN, POLK COUNTY, FLORIDA I WORKED IN A RESTRAUNT COUNTY FAIR AS A BUS-BOY. ONE OF SEVERAL RESTRAUNTS WAS A DESERT RESTRAUNT. WE SERVED ALL KINDS OF DESERTS WITH AND WITHOUT WHIP-CREAM OUT OF AIRISOL CANS. THESE EMPTIED CANS ADDED UP REAL FAST. WHAT I FOUND OUT WAS THAT INHALING THE FUMES FROM THESE CANS GAVE AN IMMEDIATE HIGH. NOW LET ME TELL YOU THAT DOING THIS AFTER CLOSING TIME WE HAD DOZENS OF CANS. THERE WERE SEVERAL OF US INCLUDING 1 BOSS DOING THIS AND WE EACH HAD SEVERAL CANS TO INHALE. I DID THIS ALL THROUGH MY SUMMER JOB. I KNOW THAT IT'S DANGEROUS BUT I'D STILL GO ON DOING THIS EVERY DAY FOR 2 YEARS. I'D HEARD THAT EVERY TIME YOU DO THIS YOU FRY SO MANY OF YOUR BRAIN CELLS THAT COULDN'T BE REPLACED. KNOWING THIS I KEPT ON DOING IT ANYWAYS. I NOW FIND MYSELF WANTING THAT FIX. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS IF IT'S TRUE ABOUT THE BRAIN CELLS AND COULD IT HAVE LED TO MY MENTAL PROBLEMS. I'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED BY A PSYCHIATRIST AS SCHIZO-AFFECTIVE BI-POLAR. I ALSO HAVE SEVERE HEADACHES AT TIMES. I WAS UNABLE TO STAY PAST 1 1/2 YEARS IN THE MILITARY BECAUSE OF MENTAL PROBLEMS. JUST A NOTE HERE. I ATTENDED COLLEGE AFTER DIAGNOSIS AND NOW I'VE GOT 2 DEGREES (ASSOCIATES AND BACHELORS IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE) WORKING ON A 3RD DEGREE (BACHELORS IN HOMELAND SECURITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY). I'D APPRECIATE ANY ADVICE YOU CAN GIVE ME. I 'M NOW FINDING MYSELF THAT TO GET THAT HIGH FEELING AGAIN I ABUSE MY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. I'VE BEEN TO THE HOSPITAL 5 TIMES FOR DRUG ABUSE IN THE PAST 1/2 YEAR. 2 OF THE TIMES BLOODWORK SHOWED ME POPPING POSITIVE FOR PCP WHEN I NEVER HAVE DONE PCP IN THE FIRST PLACE.
