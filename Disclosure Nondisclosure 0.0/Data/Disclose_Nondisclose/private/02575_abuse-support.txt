My bipolar husband has become extremely controlling.  I read others' posts and it's like he's being described to a T, so I guess I'm not alone.  He monitors everything I do, keeps me awake at night, won't let me exercise because I'm trying to "look good for someone else", repeatedly goes through our caller ID, hacks into my email, thinks I deserve no privacy, and recently has started restraining me (blocks the doorway and won't let me leave, has pinned my arms down and bullied me).  The one thing that I haven't found in common with other posts is that my husband is actually taking his medications, and going to therapy & group.  I don't know if this is just him being a jerk, or if his meds need to be adjusted, or if it's a symptom that is just part of the illness.  He was diagnosed about 9 months ago after a severe psychotic episode requiring a hospitalization.  I'm to the point where I really don't know what to do.  We have young children.  Is there any hope for my marriage?  I just don't know how I can continue to raise children with someone like this.  If he continues this bully/abusive behavior, I know I can't.  But I honestly don't know how I would go about leaving him.  He has told me he would stalk me.  Any input would be greatly appreciated - I feel like I can't think straight anymore!
