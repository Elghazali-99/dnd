My wife has been suffering mentally for about 10 years slowly getting worse,argumentative, depressed etc. would not see a Dr. 3 years ago she finally asked for help, our Dr put her on anti-depressants, this made her worse, she was admitted into a mental hospital, for 3 months she was put on all types of drugs and only got worse, During this time her Mother had an accident in her home and died, 4 weeks later one of our twin boys had a serious motorbike accident and nearly lost his arm.Finally they tried ECT, she was sent home 3 weeks later,'as cured' 6 months later she was given further treatment of ECT again treated as cured, A further treatment ECT Dec 06 the lable the psyciatrist gave it was Acute Anxiety Depression. On the present medication she seems to be getting worse, our last visit to the Psyciatrist when telling him that she was very suicidal and kept threatening to take all her pills the Dr doubled her dose of the offending Quietpine, I refused to accept this and he changed the same dose to 100mg at night, instead at Am,she is also on Mirtazapine,Zopiclone and Diazapam.
She constantly says "My head hurts" The Dr will take no notice and refuses to listen to her, I took her to a Psycotherapist who says she has BPD, Where do I go from here?? pleas help
