I wrote last week about having a lot of things going on w feeling depressed. Well im not sure what this is going on right now. It seems like im stuck in a rut & im getting restless & frustrated and almost like im in a cage if that makes sense? I go to work, & now 4 some reason every1 has changed over the passed week..very rude to me & disrespectful. & treat me like im a slave and I have a degree higher than most there & do the smallest job probably possible. Then I come home & do the same thing everynight. I had to move back in w my parents after my fiancé spilt (which is in a condo) & I feel I get no privacy, very little peace & quite..i feel like im losing my mind! My doc cut my meds way down & im not sure if that has anything to do with it but it really doesn’t matter bc now he wont work with me. How can I fix this rut with out just running away (bc that’s not even possible) I just cant keep living this way. Im so exhausted and feel like I could fall right to sleep but cant bring myself to lay down. Has any1 been here b4 and had something help to get out of the cage they were in? I mean I take meds for my mood and anxiety (I have bipolar) but it seems like nothing is helping..nothing at all..
