Hello, I am 22 year old woman in college and I have been in an off and on relationship since 2013. I met my boyfriend in college after me and my previous ex broke up. So when I first met my current boyfriend he was so charming and nice, he was cool with us partying together didn't seem jealous at all and super laid back, and we had so much fun. But then he started to show signs of jealousy and control issues, and I brushed it off because I liked him so much and it wasn't that bad yet, but I should have known better. Then he told me he loved me so I was even more taken by him. So then summer break comes along and he starts not wanting to see me, not making time for me, not wanting to bring me around his friends, he starts accusing me of lying about where I am and what I am doing, calling me demeaning names, screaming at me, and giving me the third degree. And I have always trusted him, I have never questioned what he was doing, I just figured I am a good person and if he was cheating it just wasn't meant to be. Also, we only live 30 minutes away from each other and he did not have a summer job. I started to become scared to tell him things that might make him mad and for him to question me and accuse me of things, stupid things like going out with my friends. I have never cheated on him I have always been very loyal to him while we have been in a relationship. So later that summer after maybe seeing him once a week if I was lucky, he dumped me because he said I was lying about where I was. I was so hurt, I felt like I was nothing to him. I always tried so hard to please him and nothing ever was good enough. So I picked myself up, went out with my friends and moved on. We were broken up for about 3-4 months, I had a fling with a guy who was very nice and respectable, and one night with my ex ex boyfriend, and I made out with some guy. I feel ashamed I did these things while being single because I have learned now that I do not need to be validated by men to make me feel like I am worth something, even after a breakup where someone makes you feel worthless. I was looking to feel something. And during this time my ex who had just dumped me kept calling and harassing me, saying things like "are you screwing someone else?" "*****" "****".  So school is back in session and him and I have a class together and he asks me for help and makes comments to our friends "the only reason I'd get back with her is to pass this class". So despite his mean comments and immaturity I helped him because I knew he would not pass. So while I'm helping him he keeps asking me questions about who I have been with and interrogating me, and I would just say" no one" because if I had told him he would scream at me and call me a ***** and a ****, whatever he could think of to hurt me. So then he kept calling me to hang out and probably to have sex but I denied him for a while. Then one night at a party with all our friends we get hammered drunk and mostly I did to have some liquid courage against him, but that did not work. We ended up having sex and he told me he loved me, but then the next day never called me or anything, and the next night he also brought another girl home after he told me he loved me, my girl friend saw them and this is true. I was crushed, I still loved him but he seemed to just not care. Then about two weeks later I went to another party and he was there, I got drunk again and went home with him again, stupid me. But after this he wanted to make it work and I was happy until he started giving me the third degree again, asking me who I had been with, and interrogated me to the point I couldn't handle it anymore. I told him I had slept with the respectful guy I talked about and I made out with that one guy, before I could reveal everything he damaged my car and flipped out like you wouldn't believe, screaming, calling me names, punching things, I was very scared. I left, and the next couple days he was kept calling and texting me, " how could you do this to me" and screaming at me. He acted like I cheated on him! I wasn't even with him! and he did the same damn thing, and who knows with how many, I never asked him.  Surprisingly, a few days later he wanted to start with a clean slate… but that was a lie. He had an apartment so I stayed with him 24/7 and every other day he held what I did when I was single over my head, interrogating me about how it happened and calling me a "*****" "****" and an "N*****lover" because the guy I made out with when I was single was a man of color. All of this name calling and interrogating went on for a year. I never questioned him about what he did when he was single or who he was with because I felt like it was none of my business, and I didn't want to know. I tried so hard to make up for how I made him feel, I made him dinner every night, I bought all the groceries, I did his laundry, I cleaned his room everyday, I bought him things constantly just to show how much I love him and how capable I was of being what he wanted. Pretty screwed up way of thinking, but I felt so low and unworthy after all of questioning and interrogating and name calling. I was very depressed and scared to do anything that he may think was wrong. Well the name calling and manipulation became too much for me and I left. He then told me how sorry he was so everything he had done to me and how he treated me, and that he would get help. I was still hesitant and very confused about what I even wanted anymore, I felt empty. Long story short, I made a friend who happened to be bi sexual and she was very nice to me and told me that I was too good for him. I confided in her because I didn't know who else to talk to that actually cared. So one night we got hammered, and I didn't even remember anything but I guess me and the girl kissed and I don't remember it at all. I told her that I only want to be friends and that I still love my ex very much, I am just very upset with how he was treating me and I don't know If I can deal with someone like that for the rest of my life, and she respected that. We were only ever just friends, and thats all so I never told him about that encounter. So now me and my ex got back together after he said he got help, our relationship is much better this time around. But the past still haunts me, I feel guilty about not telling him absolutely everything, but my friends say " he dumped you, you were single, you had no obligation to him, and if you did tell him absolutely everything he would kill you". My friends say I am too honest and I shouldn't be about my past because I was single. I feel like in the past I have used alcohol to forget about my problems, but I am not like that anymore at all, I rarely go out or drink. My friends also say I am the best girlfriend because of how patient and nice I am to him after everything thats happened, but why do I feel so guilty about not revealing everything, can someone please help me? I feel like revealing the two things I have kept private to myself about when I was single will only mess everything up that we have now and worked so hard for. I have never cheated or anything but he doesn't ever forgive and forget . Please don't be to harsh, Im desperate for some assistance.
