I have no idea if this is abuse or not, but my husband and I have been together for 6 years and recently married since May.  We have been on and off within the past 6 years due to our differences.  Well while being married we have split up twice due to him not trusting me.  I have done nothing for him not to trust me but he just does not trust me.  He started going through my purse, my receipts, my phone, my text messages, my email account, and etc.  So we split because in my previous relationship I was beaten and abused badly and I will not have this happen again.  This however, is different.  I am not sure that this is even abuse but here is the question.  
 First question is - we were have sex and then he turns me over and pulls my hair and forced himself inside my rectum.  I am not trying to be gross but and I am sorry.  I was yelling to stop, crying and I started bleeding. After he was done he said nothing to me and thought it was funny.  Is this ok?
 Second question is - while wrapping presents for the kids we were watching lifetime channel and it was something about someone killing a woman and he stated that he could kill someone easy and get away with it.  I laughed it off and he said serious, " I could make cement blocks and tie them around YOUR ankles and throw YOU in the water and no one would ever know."  I laughed and said me why use an example on me and he stated that because he has thought about killing me twice.  Should I be worried?  I know this is a stupid question I am worried but I am walking on egg shells so nothing bad happens, he has only touched me once a long time ago and never since then.  But he does play mind games with me a lot so I dont know if I should take this serious or not.  I guess I just need some opinions.  Thanks
