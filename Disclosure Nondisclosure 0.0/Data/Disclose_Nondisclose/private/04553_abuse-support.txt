I'm a middle-aged guy. When I was between the ages of 6 and 12, different groups of older boys (and maybe men, I can't remember), exposed me to hard core pornography and touched me inappropriately, and also made me touch them (I think) although there was never any force or coercion/threats involved. At one point I think I might have been penetrated and ejaculated on. 
 When I was around 13 or 14 (or maybe 15), I then acted out with my younger cousin who would have been 8 or 9 (or maybe 10) at the time. We were always hanging out together outside and somehow we ended up doing some inappropriate touching on several occassions. It was just gentle touching and it never went beyond that (no oral, penetration or anything like that). I can't remember how it even started or how many incidents there were, maybe 3 or 4 in total. It always felt very naughty and I think we both knew it was wrong. My family and I moved away when I was 15 and it never happened again.
 All my life I've had deep feelings of guilt and shame about what happened to me and what I did with my cousin, and I've had to deal with all the usual issues of low self-esteem, social anxiety, depression, helplessness etc. 
 It's only recently with the help of my wife that I've started to get over what happened to me, but I'm now overwhelmed by intense guilt and shame about what I did with my cousin, and I can't seem to categorise it properly: I know boys often explore each other in that way, but I was a bit older so I should have known better. I guess my previous experiences resulted in me not knowing what was 'normal'. I never had any sex education or anything like that, so all I knew was what had happened to me and what I saw in porn films/magazines. 
 The guilt has become so bad in recent days that I've been feeling like I'm sort of monster who doesn't deserve to live.
 Should I talk to my cousin about it with the risk of this becoming known to all the family, or should I just move on and try and forget it?
