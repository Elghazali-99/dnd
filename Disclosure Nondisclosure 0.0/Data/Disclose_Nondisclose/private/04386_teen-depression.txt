Hello, I'm a fifteen year old girl and I have a great family. At school, everyone seems to like me and I am considered a genuinely nice person who always smiles and gets along with everyone. It hard though because though everyone like me, I don't have any super close friends. I feel like everyone has a best friend and I do but she goes to a different school so I often feel alone at lunch. Also, I have really good grades but it takes everything in me to earn them. I am largely involved in two sports so I get home late and usually don't fall asleep till 2:00 am because of homework. School is making me feel so stressed and hurt and I wonder if that is also a factor so my sadness. Every single night I cry and I'm crying right now just wanting to go to sleep and not have to study for two big tests tomorrow. Also, I think it's possible that I'm depressed because I feel like I'm faking my happiness a lot and when I'm with my friends and having a conversation, I feel out of it and just really alone. I have also been abnormally quiet- I'm usually really peppy. So I don't know what's going on or what I should do or of I am even depressed.
