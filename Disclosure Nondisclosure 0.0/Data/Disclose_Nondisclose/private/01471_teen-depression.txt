I'm a 15 year old girl. I've been severely depressed for about 5 years now. I've had depression for about 10 years now. My parents are divorced. I've lost many family and friends to death. I've had brain surgery, heart problems, stomach problems, breathing problems, and ankle problems. I've been bullied every year of school. I can't keep friends for very long. I push people away. I get hurt a lot. The list goes on and on. But lately, it's been really worse. I've been put on an antidepressant, and that helps, but I'm still very depressed. I tend to get very pissy and upset very easily. I remember when I was little, if someone would just tell me not to do something, I would start tearing up. I don't enjoy getting up every morning anymore. I dread everyday, and I love sleeping. And my parents are no help. I've told them before I'm depressed and they just say I'll be fine. Just the other day, I got into a huge screaming fight with my father over me using too many of the families phone minutes. He called the number that I used the majority of them on, which is my boyfriend that my parents don't approve of cause he's 18, (which is bull because I am very happy with him), and told him that he could not talk to me anymore. (which didn't happen). And he was trynna guilt me into feeling bad by telling me that he spends all this money on me for drivers ed, and going to football camp, and this is how i repay him. to leave barely any minutes for the rest of the month. So I packed up my stuff and left. and my mom came and got me. It's just stupid bull like this that **** me off soo much. Plus, one of my friends had just commited suicide July 4th. So I haven't been the happiest person in the world. People just suck. I tell like my mom, that I hate people. ): People love to use me and abuse me and I'm so tired of it. I dont wanna commit suicide, but I don't know what to do about this. ): Any advice.? I'm losing my mind here.
