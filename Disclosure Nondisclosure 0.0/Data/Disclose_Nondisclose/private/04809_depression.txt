Hi. I'm 26 years old. I don't know if I always suffered with anxiety/depression, if I have it was never bad enough to not be able to 'get on' with life and daily routine. The past 2 or so years I feel it's been bad enough to where I do 'get on' with life but never find myself truly happy with small things in life that I used to find joy in. Recently I was prescribed 5mg oxycodone for a kidney stone, I took the medication as needed, which was one pill every 4-6 hours or as needed. I never abused the medication. I never took multiple pills looking for a "high". What I did notice was that while taking 5mg's 2-3 times per day, I felt happy. I felt like myself again. I found joy in small things like a beautiful day or a cute commercial on tv. I didn't feel anxious or worried. I felt like me. I started researching about oxycodone and what it does in the brain. It releases dopamine which is what give us our feeling of "happiness". I know there is an opiate epidemic in our country so trying to explain to a doctor that 5mgs of oxycodone is helping me like no antidepressants, benzo has ever before.  It seems unbelievable, I know that. After my prescription ran out I didn't experience any withdraw. I didn't feel sick. My mental state was ok - for me ok means, I was back to feeling anxious and a little sad. I didn't feel as if I was going to do anything crazy to get oxycodones again, like steal or lie to doctors. But it's had me thinking for a few weeks now, could oxycodone be my cure? I know it's hard to believe and I really don't expect anyone to 'get' where I'm coming from. But for me, I don't want to get high, I don't want to be "out of touch" with reality, I want the opposite I want to be able to achieve this "happiness" without medication. I just would like an answer or some help.
