it's been 12 days since i had unprotected oral and protected anal with a guy.\ (i'm a bisexual). in any case i observed that there's a tiny bump at the right side of the of my neck at the back, the very right side. i'm just askin if this is a lymph node? is it a symptom of some STD? or is just some skin infection. i've checked all the areas at the back part of the neck and it's the only tiny bump i saw. and there not red. they do not have ulcerations. it's basically just a bump. i hear that lymph nodes are located at either sides of the neck but is it at the right back part of the neck? and do they swell one at a time? the bump doesn't hurt too..
after two more days it's still there.
but now i'm experiencing pain in my muscles and bones.
 but i'm also considering the fact that i always sleep at 1 or 2 or 3 a.m in the morning so i get quite a lack of sleep can that be a stronger reason for my muscle and bone pains? i slept at 2 a.m yesterday and woke at 6:30 in the morning, can that be a reason too?
