Background:mom of two children 2&4 new step mom to two children 4&7 my issue is this I have recently left my job as we can't afford daycare for all four and within a year of being in his children's life I'm completely in charge of everything they spend all there time with me during the summer and school year and I'm having a hard time getting along with the seven yr old I'm unsure of how to bond with him at first we got along great we talked all the time he always wanted to go where I was going but now that I'm having to discipline him were having issues when I ask him to do his one chore which is taking out the trash he often cries and takes 20 minutes to do it getting him to do homework is a nightmare he rolls his eyes and whines I have to stay on him all morning long about getting dressed and ready for school when I ask him to not do something he'll wait until I'm not looking and do it behind my back I'm just unsure of how to go about things with him so that he doesn't resent me just need a bit of advice on how to go about handling little things like that
