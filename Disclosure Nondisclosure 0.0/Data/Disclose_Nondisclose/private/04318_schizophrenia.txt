My daughter is 15 her teacher has told me what she is experiencing. She feels like people are constantly watching her she thinks people are stealing her thoughts and people are inserting thoughts into her. She comes up with psychotic things and acts psychotic at times. When she talks sometimes she doesn't make any sense. She sometimes see's things getting bigger and smaller and things shaking like it's about to expload. She has thoughts of killing other people and herself. She sometimes feels hands touching her on some parts of her body. She would actually kill people because she feels controlled to. Sometimes she'll smell something odd for a few seconds. She thinks people are out to get her. And that people on tv are sending her secret messages even though they're not saying her name etc. She has also been having nightmares every night but she says they don't make sense and they are horrorfying and above the level of voilent and gory because they scare her alot. What is it? and does she need hospitalization?
