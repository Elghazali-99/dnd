I Was on Celexa for 12 months several years back following my son's death and got off of it after 2 or 3 months.  I wiened off very slowly and aside from some headaches and some ringing in my ears, it went pretty well.  10 weeks ago my mother passed, and the depression came back and the doc gave me 20mg Lexapro.  I took it for 10 weeks and it had no affect.  It didn't help my depression at 10 weeks so the doc prescribed 5 MG ABILIFY  Within 6 hours, I was wound up like a watchspring, and had the worst headache ever which I still have after 6 days.  I feel horrible, no energy, have the Heebie-jeebies I am twitching, no appetite am constipated and again, I HAVE NEVER FELT SO POORLY.  That's not all but you get the picture.  I am scared, this is the brain they are messing with and the doc switched me to Cymbals and told me to stop Ability. Which I did after only 1 pill.  1 pill 6 days ago and still feel rotten.  Has this happened to anyone, if so, can I expect this to go away 
anytime soon.  I welcome any experiences from anyone that knows more than I do which is just about anyone.  This Abilfy is a terrible drug from my experience.  The last thing I feel like doing is ride my bike with a basket on it along the shores of the neighborhood pond like in the TV commercial.  Thanks in advance,  Zack from Phoenix
