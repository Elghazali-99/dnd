I am 24 yrs old, and I have recently visited a doctor for a general check-up.  I have been having chest pains off and on for a couple of years, so I brought that up in my this check-up with the doctor.  We chatted a little, and she asked if I was nervous.  I told her yeah, I am, I can be a nervous person.  So she jumped straight to prescribing me some anti-depressant meds.  I was very uncomfortable with this idea, and I became a bit over dramatic about it because my mom has a history with meds and I do not want to follow the same path.   By over dramatic, I mean I cried a little.  She just decided that I should take these meds within the first 5 mins of the appointment, and despite me being uncomfortable with it, she did not offer alternatives, and if she did offer she made sound like they were going to be useless and a big hassle.  I have had shortness of breath and a tight chest before because I have been anxious, but these pains I feel hurt.  I have to pause what I am doing to let it wear off.  I don't know if I should be concerned or not, so that is why I brought it up.  She kept telling me during my time with her that she cannot wave a magic wand, and it all goes away.  I told her I know, I'm just asking questions.  And she told me that I was just making excuses for myself not to take the meds... but I am not comfortable with the idea, so I don't know why she was being so pushy.  She did give me some information to get some lab tests done... Should I just move on?  I really just didn't like her attitude very much, it was incredibly pushy and slightly condescending.  I didn't feel she addressed my concerns appropriately, and some other concerns I have I did not even venture with her because of her attitude.
