i know why it happens...because you go to the psych and they dx you in the first visit, usually less than 30 minutes.
how can they do that?..they dont even know if your telling the truth yet or if you have underlying conditions or if you are having a good or bad day, or used drugs and alcohol...but no, they talk for their 15 minutes and call you bipolar.
i toldmy psych that doesnt fit me.. i dont have mood swings that last for days or weeks...mine dont even last for hours, they can change in 2 minutes..plus im never way up or way down, but the psych hears mood swings, anger,and lack of self control they just jump to bipolar...i think they dx everyone with that now.
it makes me angry because it takes so long for a doc to admit hes wrong and not justify his dx but change it.
if i would have been dx with BPD instead of bipolar for years maybe i could have avoided lots of mistakes because i would have gotten the correct treatment.
how do you deal with these docs that in 15 minutes label you without any fundamental investigation and just keep rolling with it.... how do you finally get them to see they were wrong?
