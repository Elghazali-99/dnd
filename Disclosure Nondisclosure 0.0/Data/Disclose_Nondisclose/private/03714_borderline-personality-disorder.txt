I am the type of person who always has to have someone with them. I've been in my relationship on and off for the past 3 going on 4 years, but I have also had one other serious yet unstable relationship within that time. I have trust issues, and I'll be fine with my boyfriend (and other family members) but then all of a sudden I just get this instant rage like I want to fight someone. For example, the other night my mom told me to tell my boyfriend to go home so I could go up the street and it just made me so mad. She came home and I just started going off on her and ever since that little episode I'm kind of wondering if something is wrong with me. Also, I came across this borderline personality disorder and read several articles about it and the more I look at it the more I realize I have many of the symptoms. Such as depression, relationship issues (unstable), trust, anger, hate being alone or feeling like I'm going to be left. 
 I really want to go see a psychiatrist but I don't even know where to begin... Can I have some help or just talk to someone about it?
