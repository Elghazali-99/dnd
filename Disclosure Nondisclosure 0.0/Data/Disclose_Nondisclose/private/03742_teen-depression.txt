I am a recent high-school graduate and 18 years old. My father and I have never quite got along, and he has recently gotten worse.  My boyfriend of four years whom our family is very close to broke up with me and I refused to take him back.  He was much like my father, controlling and verbally/emotionally abusive.  Since the break up, I have started dating one of my friends. My father has never met him, but hates him.  He has been calling me a **** and many other horrible things lately, and ever since my new boyfriend accompanied me to a trip to my college for orientation, the fighting has been getting more heated.   My real problem here is that my father has the title to my car and pays for everything. I can't move anywhere because he has never let me have a job, so I have no money to my name, and could not afford to pay rent.  My boyfriend has offered me a place to stay, but I dont want to put him in the middle and make things worse.  He would also take away my car so even if I did get a job, I couldn't get to work.  I want to try and save our relationship, but he does not talk to me, and when he does, it is just yelling. I feel very stuck but I cannot live with my parents anymore.  Any Ideas??
