Hello everyone I'm new, I hope you understand me, my first language is not English, but this is my experience trying to summarize a bit, two years ago, more or less, I having  General Anxiety, some doctor told me I have also symptoms of OCD, and of course some depression, I have been prescribed, some well-known medications, I get tired of taking them anyway because, it makes me  felt that my life was not normal and I really did not like the way the medications made ​​me feel, for almost two months, I've left the medications gradually, the beginning I thought it would be nice, but the anxiety started to give me problems especially on certain days a month, more exactly a week before my period, began to feel really terrified of my own thoughts, it's hard to explain, anyway what I mean is that anxiety returned, more than a week ago I started taking the capsules of St. John's wort, the early days as I felt an improvement, but like three days ago, the anxiety is at its maximum point, I blame my PMS, apparently the herb St. John is not enough these days, I had to take clonazepam,sometimes only half a pill because I had to calm down or go to sleep , I honestly do not know if, should go back to my psychiatrist or continue taking the SJW for longer to see if I finally feel a difference? I accept advice and opinions, thanks in advance, everyone have a nice day.
