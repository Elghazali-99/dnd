I am sure this is a loaded question but I just need reassurance that there is light at the end of this tunnel I am in.   My most obviouis issue with hormones is the migraines I would get with just about every period.   I am almost 52 and the past 4 years I have been able to abort about half of the migraines with some changes in diet, habits and the help of sumatriptans.  Two years ago I had a hysteroscopy for constant uterine bleeding; 8 day periods, short break and then a slow "drip" the rest of the month. I also was on Divigel .25 and Prometrium.   Last year, since the hysteroscopy did not help except for the quantity of fluid, I had my uterus removed and a large cyst on one ovary removed.  I seemed to feel pretty good for the first two months after the hysterectomy, (July 2011), but then started to feel like I could jump in to a migraine at any time. I stopped taking the Prometrium after the operation.  But, it just seems like I only feel good just a couple of days out of the month and that I could launch into a migraine at any time, not just once like before around menses.  Due to some pretty severe morning anxiety attacks and a good dose of the blues because of this dilemna, my Naturopath upped my Divigel to .50 and some 5-HTP to jack up the Seratonin levels.  This has helped with the anxiety ALOT but I still feel like my body is waging a war of hormones. I should note that I have only been on the increased dose of Divigel for a little under three weeks.  My ovary hurts on occasion (have had on and off cysts for years) and I feel head-achey a lot.  When will I get over this?  I would say 99% of the people who have had this says it will go away when my hormones reach a "cruising altitude" but when could that be?  Since I don't have a uterus I don't know when I will have gone through the change.  Any words of encouragment?  Thank you so much!~C
