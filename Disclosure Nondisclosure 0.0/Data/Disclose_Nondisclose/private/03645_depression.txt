I know this is the most talked about subject on this site.  Many people have bad mouthed their doctors and Effexor.
 My doctor, who I saw a couple of days ago could not have been nicer.  She took her time with me, and explained that my abrupt withdrawal from anti-depressants has always brought back depression feelings.  However, she is going to help me wean off slowly.  She says she will be with me all the way, and can see her anytime.
 After 20 years on anti-depressants, this will be the first time, with the help of a doctor, that I will slowly go off medication.  As Effexor is the worst, I can take my time.  Last time, five years ago, I went cold turkey, and was very poorly for two weeks, but after that was fine for a year.  This time I mean to kick anti-depressants once and for all if I can.  
 I am currently on 150mg Effexor.  My doctor has now suggested I take 150mg on day, and 75mg the next, and so on.  She said do this as long as I like, and then go back for the next stage.  I reckon I can do this.
 Effexor has been really good for me, but now I want to be medication free.  I am 72 years old, and I am going to be really strong about this.
 Doctor and Effexor no trouble for me - I am lucky.
 Also I live in UK where at my age, I do not have to pay for drugs.  I hope I will lose all the weight I have gained on this drug, which is the only real drawback for me.
