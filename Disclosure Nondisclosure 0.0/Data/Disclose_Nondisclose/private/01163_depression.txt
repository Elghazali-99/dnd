I question whether my depression will get better and I am going to explain why.  When I started to have this panic disorder, I realized that there could be the possibility of me experiencing many panic attacks all throughout the day each day (though this is something that could be false and could only just be a few panic attacks per day instead).  However, it could also be something true--we don't know.  But this is a risk that my mind was not willing to take and decided to shut down all emotions in order to prevent the fear from happening, leaving me in a state where I feel no pleasure at all.  I feel that not even this state I'm in will even get better because my mind is also not willing to take the risk of having it get better because of the possibility (whether true or false) that if it does get better, that will no longer hold off the fear and cause the panic to return because if my emotions return (in this case, pleasure), then my panic will also return since panic is also an emotion.
