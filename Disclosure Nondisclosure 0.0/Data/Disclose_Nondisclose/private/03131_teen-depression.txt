I have a 16 year old daughter who has type 1 Diabetes since the age of 5 and who also suffers from anxiety and depression since the age of 11 she has been getting treatment by seeing therapists and taking anti depressants for the past 4 years from numerous sources available in our home town she has had major problems attending school due to her anxiety its to the point where I can barely keep a job because she wont go to school and they call me everyday because she just will not stay longer than an hour at school I have talked to school social workers, hotlines, therapist, emergency room workers, pediatricians, emergency mobile crisis agencys throughout the years and nothing has worked for longer than a month or two she just keeps getting worst and now that shes older its getting harder and harder to get her to cooperate I have had a very difficult time getting this child the help she needs and dont know what else to do about it she has in the past threaten to hurt herself and others but has never acted on these threats other than hitting me when she gets one of her anxiety attacks and wants to be left alone she mostly throws things around and breaks things but more recently she has started to try to run away or walk out of school when they wont let her go home I dont know what else to do or how to help her get the help she needs does anyone know of any other ways to get help im to the point where I will try anything.
