When i was a child, I would say as young as 5 years old, i believed that the reason my belly button went in, was because when i was a baby i was shot in the stomach,( were my belly button is). i honestly believed this was true and it kinda bothered me but i never asked any one about it as i guess it was something no one was meant to talk about. ???? I believe several other things too like there was a room made perfect for me above our second floor of the house though i could never find a way to get to it, me and my friend would try and figure out how to find it and that there was a dead body in a forest park close to my house but when i looked i couldn't find it and blue beetles that where evil and controlled the wold. There was other things too but i never thought that was weird until i was talking to my boyfriend the other day and he didn't experiences anything like that, i mean i actually believed it was true and happening at the time, . he had fantasy and i had that too such as things as such as a tree that turned into a monster when you didn't look called RArr .now i know it was unlikely or not right. Is this delusional? or is this normal? I had "imagery friends" as others call them as well though this was only discovered years later because of research and "proof" that "M" was never at my school. Is it even possible that a young child could have such a delusion? or could there be another explanation? did anyone else go through this? People as a young person always said i was overly imaginative and i don't really think so. i also had depression and was anxious a lot but nothing was picked up till older such as 12, 13 years.
