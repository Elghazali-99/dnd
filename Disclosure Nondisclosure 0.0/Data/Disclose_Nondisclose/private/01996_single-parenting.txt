 Register for upcoming health chats: http://www.medhelp.org/health_chats/list_upcoming  Do you have children or teenagers that are acting up or acting out? Behavioral problems in childhood and adolescence are very common and in many cases part of normal development as children learn to test their boundaries and to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behavior. We've all heard about the Terrible Two's and teenage rebellion. But sometimes behavioral problems can be symptomatic of an emotional disturbance or disorder.
 If you have questions about a child who is overly shy or aggressive; who swears, lies, steals, or fights; who has separation anxiety; who throws temper tantrums; or who is violent towards themselves, other people, or animals, get answers to your questions in this hour long chat. Join Dr. Kevin Kennedy of Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates to learn how to tell the difference between normal and excessive behavioral issues and how to deal with behavior problems through systematic behavior management plans.
