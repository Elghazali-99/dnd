hi 
           i have been married for 11 years now and i have two children a son 3 yrs,
           and a daughter 7 yrs. mine was a arranged marriage,for the initial 2 yrs mine
           was a very happy marriage in which my husband was very understanding and he always 
           listened to every word that i would say which did not go well with my in laws they never
          liked him having affection towards me rather they would try to create misunderstandings 
          between us.
                             during both my pregnancies my husband tried to be supportive but my in laws would
                             speak ill about me to him who would be out at work whole day and
                            when he would be back he would try to believe me but my in laws would
                            convince him that i was the one who was at fault which would make him
                            believe them.since then my father in law at various occasions have illtreated
                            me and asked me to leave the house which i have once as i was also angry
                          at my husband for not taking my side,but then my husband came and made up 
                           for it and we began to live happily that was again not taken well by my inlaws
                           they again created problems in our lives by telling my husband that i was not
                         the  right girl for him and he should leave me and the kids. now my husband
                           has left me in my mothers house with both the children and has applied
                          for a divorce without my consent and my in laws are supporting him.
                          my husband used to adore the kids but after my father in law poisened his
                          mind he does not even care for them,even after the divorce was applied
                        i went to meet him(we are living long distance)with both my children,
                        but my in laws illtreated us and abused us ,and told us that they would
                       throw me and the kids out of the house they did not let my husband visit us
                     during our stay for four days.then my father in law very cleverly got the best 
                    lawyer and got a temporary injunction against me and the kids as he mentioned
                      in the summon that he disowns his son as the flats are in his name .this was
                     not for his son but for me and the children,i could not believe he could 
                     fall to such great heights .i had gone to re concile for the children and the love
                    that was there once upon a time but they played such a dirty game .
                                       my husband is just a puppet in their hands.now as i have come back to
                                       my mothers house i have been advised by my lawyer to file a restition
                                      as i am a peaceful person i do not want to go in for any criminal cases
                                       though they have done wrong to me.i want to fight in the civil law.
                                     hoping one day my husband will understand the ill minds of my in laws
                                     and come back to me and the kids.
