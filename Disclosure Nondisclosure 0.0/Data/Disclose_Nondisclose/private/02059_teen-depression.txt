I'm 15, female and honestly I have no idea what my problems are. 
 This is going to sound weird and I'm about scared to post it but I feel as thought I may be heading to a very dangerous place. Not committing suicide but rather hurting someone. I just want to destroy something, someone, anyone. I can envision it. No guns, no weapons but my hands, arms, muscles, teeth, legs pounding as I run off. It's sick how easily that I can envision it. The really sick thing is how badly I want it sometimes. I'm not sure when I'll give in or why I don't, but still I can't bring myself to it. Which is probably best. 
 Since 7th grade I've been dealing with anxiety and this past year what my mother and therapist have classified as 'depression'. But the um...listed above isn't new. I would fight with my sister when I was younger and instantly revert to violence then feel complete remorse for it sometimes sitting in my room crying about it. 
Other times when I'm not feeling this current surge of violence I'm feeling very low and unwanted. My self confidence is shot. I get hurt when I see my other friends happy, yet I can't tell them how I feel. It's not right for me to burden them when everything else is fine. I've hurt myself before. Scratching myself (not cutting) with a knife, biting myself, scratching with my fingernails (which turned out worse then the knife), punching walls (sounds stupid I know). I feel so abandoned. My heart sometimes feels heavy and hurts, I can't sleep anymore I have to take meds to fall asleep before 3 am. I don't want to do anything, half the time I can't will myself to. I haven't seen my friends all summer I have problems leaving my house, I get extremely anxious and often have panic attacks. I could keep babbling but I'll cut it off here. 
 *note: I have a cognitive therapist (works with breathing techniques and managing anxiety, not a regular therapist), I take some meds.
