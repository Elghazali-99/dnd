I'm about 13, blood pressure is about 117/66. I read on a woman who survived breast cancer because she caught it early. But she had absolutely no symptoms at all. I'm now worried that I could have something, but no symptoms are showing. Over the past week, my muscles have been a bit weaker, particularly today I have muscle weakness. Maybe because I'm out of shape. Shortness of breath, or at least I think so. Feels like I need to take deeper ones. My nose has been congested in the mornings, then gets better as the days go by. I've been zoning out more than usual. Feeling down. My bowels are either constipation, or a little is coming out, or I have to push really hard to see anything. Trying to fully get my appetite back. I'm not eating as much, but it's coming back. I had a temporary lost of appetite. I'm just turned 13. Could anyone help me at all, see if it may be something? Also I heard weakness in the arms may be connected to ingesting toxins. Could someone summarize all these symptoms to see if it's something I should ask about?
