Good morning !! 
I've been on birth control pills for only two months and finished my last pack in June. My last period was in June and I was expecting a period in the end of July...its August 10 and I still don't have my period.. I know that stopping birth control can cause a delay in your period so I've definitely considered that as a reason as to why my period has not come yet 
I've been having slight pelvic pain and went to the doctor he gave me urine pregnancy test and came it out negative. I went back a few days later and took another test which also came out negative. He said I MAY have something called PID which is an infection that goes away with anti biotics but he wasn't 100% sure 
Taking his opinion into consideration I went to an urgent care center and took a blood test to confirm for my own sake. 
Negative results!!!! 
This morning I am very nauseous and threw up in my car. I don't know what's going on I've read it's possible that I've tested too early to know if my period was delayed but also that it is uncommon to get a false negative blood test 
Please help !!! I'm getting an ultra sound done next week ... Has anyone ever been in this situation ??!
