OK so I am goiing to start by saying I feel like a fraud.  I think I might be depressed, but then it could just be sttention seeking? or maybe I am very slightly suicidal, but then maybe I am just a littl crazy and a whole lot normal and just driving myself insane. 
I seem to go through cycles of "low" times. I don't think I am depressed but then I'm not sure how else to describe it. I hate my job, my marriage is on the rocks, my parental family is hard work and I really can't be arsed with life much. I feel stressed and irritable, I waste hours watching TV or surfing the net and then resolve to be better tomorrow but I never am. I don't get to sleep until 2 or 3am and then get cross with myself because I sleep in and don't get much of a morning with the kids before work. 
I get through work and most people think I am fine, I get through home life and hubby doesn't seem to notice anything wrong  (then again he wouldn't really notice if I started henging noose's up everywhere). I hae a very nice automatic emotional wall surrounding me which I have no idea how to take down. But then on the inside I'm screaming, panicky and keep writing suicidal/depressive stuff even though I have no intention of doing anything. 
I lie continuously, but only to myself, I make stuff out worse than it is when I put stuff on paper, it's like attention seeking only I don't show it to anyone. 
I am not normal and I have no Idea what to do, it has been this way for years and it is only getting worse.
please tell me I am normal or crazy or something? can anyone relate to this? I feel like a freak and I feel so guilty for being this way.
