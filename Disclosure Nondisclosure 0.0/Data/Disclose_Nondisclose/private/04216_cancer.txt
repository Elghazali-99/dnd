I'm 20, relatively fit, do sports etc but I had a pain in the lower right of my stomach (around where you'd have pain with the appendix but it wasn't that) and changing bowel habits so I went to the doctors and had tests done etc and they said there was a problem in my liver but other than that nothing else was wrong. The pain has been gone for a while now (about 2 years ago I went to the doctor) and I had more blood taken a few months ago which said there was still something wrong with my liver. I had an ultrasound done as well and everything was fine they checked around the abdomen and said there were no problems. I didn't really think much of it until I started having a full sort of feeling under my right rib cage as if something is there and when I drink alcohol it feels worse and I get a weird tingling type sensation when I bend over certain ways. Recently I started to get a pain in my back around the same place where I get the full feeling and the pain comes and goes. I haven't done a fully solid poo in a while but they don't change anymore, it's not like diarrhoea it's just softer than normal. I am quite worried about it all. Although, I have moved away from home for university when i started getting these pains and sensations around my ribs and I have been consuming a lot of alcohol and have a bad diet. Thanks for any responses in advance.
