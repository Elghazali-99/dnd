Hello, I am wondering if anybody has a suggestion of medications that work to help with memory problems associated with SCT that will not cause more memory problems or possible brain damage with long term use? The reason that I have a fear of more memory damage or brain damage from certain meds is that while searching for medications to help with memory I have come across information that certain medications like aderall and others can actually cause memory damage with long term use, plus I already have memory problems and I don't need more.I really need something to help because I am planning on going to college for bioengineering and I want to be able to successfully store and retrieve  the information  that I learn instead of forgetting the information after some time of not constantly using the information. My doctor has prescribed to me provigil to relieve the feeling of constantly feeling tired and sleepy, but I am not sure it will help with memory retention and memory retrieval, so I was looking to also add something else to stabilize my memory. Please help?
