Thanks everyone for telling ur stories, it really makes me feel better that im not the only one dealing w these same issues. Im 38 weeks pregnant right now. Oct 2012 was quite crazy for me, i got laid off from my job of 10 years, the followimg week my bf broke up w me and the following week i found out i was pregnant. When i told him i was pregnant he really tried to pressure me into an abortion, like almost went too far w it. Then he didnt speak to me until january and acted like he want to be a father. He only came to the second ultrasound and i text him after every dr appt but he puts no effort forth at all. I have to be the one that always starts the conversation.  I dont even know if he has any baby stuff at all. Also i moved out of state in may to live w my parents (unemployed single n prego, prob my best choice to move home) so i cant blame him for not coming to my new dr appts but im getting real close to havin my baby and its just been getting so hard to not worry about what hes gonna do... i mean i want my boy to know his father but if hes gonna b like this maybe i dont. But who knows, i didnt text him after last weeks appt to see if hed text me and nothing... he seems to be too busy drinking w his new gf. Oh and his mother is driving me crazy. I only met her a few months ago and she is all into the baby, emails and fb msgs all the time. Its nice that she cares being her son doesnt seem to, but she has this "im better than everyone" attitude so all her msgs to me just seem snotty and condesending. Im really just trying to stay calm, not worry and relax, especially for the baby being i am so close to my due date, so thank you for listening, and if u got any advise, ill gladly take it! <3
