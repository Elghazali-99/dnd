I am a 49 year old lady in meanopause.  Rather than have hormone replacement my doctor has put me on a mild anti-depressant.  He clearly is unable to stop the hot flashes but he feels we can control them and other symptoms by taking a mild dose of  Citalopram.  I have been getting SEVERE!! thigh cramps.  Most times in the night but I have also had them hit me out of the blue while sitting.  I feel like I have been kicked by a horse as it hurts so bad and continues to be sore for weeks afterwards.  I fear these cramps so much that if I feel the slightest hint of it coming on I fly out of bed and stand on that leg (not easy to do..lol)  For someone who has never had a thigh cramp...it paralyzes you.  The pain is intense and my husband bless him...gets up with me and tries to soothe me.  I scream and cry until it passes.  With the hot summer days here I drink as much as I can due to the heat and the hot flashes to try and replenish my fluid.  If I drink much more I will float away and as it is, I am up 4-5 times a night to empty my bladder.  In hind-sight, drinking the amount of fluids I am it cannot be related to dehydration...any help or suggestions would be appreciated.  I find I am holding myself in a tense manner for fear another thigh cramp will hit me.  I get them in my toes too when I retire for the night.
 I am tired and emotional with this menopause and just want to not have these THIGH CRAMPS!!!
 So...what do you think?
