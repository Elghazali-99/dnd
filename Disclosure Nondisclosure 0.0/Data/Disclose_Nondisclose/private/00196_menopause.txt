Good afternoon,  Thank you for taking the time to view my question.  First a bit about myself.  I am a 52 year old woman, non-smoker, I have had three children and up to a few years ago a spot perfect period.  About 5 years ago I had spotting and I went to my doctor where I had a biopsy, pap and ultrasound done.  They found that I had fibroid s and which may be causing my spotting.   No pre-cancer at all detected.  I go every year for a pap test.
 Fast forward a few years.  My periods seem to come now every 23rd day not like the 28th like I used to have.  In the past 6 months my periods have been all wacky.  I miss a month.  Then I have two periods in one month and then it seems normal again.  I just went for a pap but my dr explained that a pap will not show uterine cancer. 
My question (after this long book I have written here)...is this.  Can this fluctuation in my periods due to the fact I am about to become menopausal or could this indeed be cancer.  I have been experiencing mild hot flashes from time to time as well.  
 Thanks again for reading my post and have a great day.
