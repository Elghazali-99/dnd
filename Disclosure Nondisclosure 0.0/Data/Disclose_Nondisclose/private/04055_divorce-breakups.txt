I am 31 years old and I know my husband for about 10 years. we met at university. I am independent financially and during these years I really did my best to help our relationship gets better and better. We barely argue with each other and totally respect. I love him and I know He does. we had couple bad experiences before got married. He had relationships outside I really don't have any idea how deep were those relations. He keep saying they were just flirting because the person was living in different city I think it may correct but I do know there were more cases (maybe not severe ). we were about to separate and he cut those relations and promised and we got married 4 years ago. there was a little push maybe from me to get marry faster but he always claims  I am the best person he ever could find or choose for life.his parents have divorces when he was 10 (and what a bad divorce). recently I was feeling he doesn't enjoy or even like having sex with me. he barely orgrasim. couple weeks ago he start complaining about himself that he is restless person and nothing makes him happy.he always does risks to make him excited(we lost money because of some risky businesses).He told we have a great life. everything in order but I am not happy about it. I love you but my feeling has been change I love you like my sister and I feel bad when I sex with you. I am not predictable and I am worrying to cheat you this way. I really don't want to hurt you so lets separate ... but not now I want to try work on my mind so give me 4 months If I couldn't fix my corrupted mine it is better to live apart. when he started talking about these stuff I was completely shocked because I never saw even a slim chance of separation in our life and our relation was like a  good sample for everybody. I am really frustrated please help me and advise
