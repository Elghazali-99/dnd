Alright I am 19 and for the past 20 months have been dealing with a hodge podge of seemingly endless symptoms. It started with an extreme infection in my hand that cause the tip of my thumb to turn all sorts of nastly colors and discolored my hand and pain until the tip of the skin of my thumb sluffed like giant scab. After that I have been dealing with severe fatigue, my bones ache, constant infections, and getting sick all the time. I have been bounced from specialist to specialist as one will tell me its not this your symptoms seem more like this field, so on and so forth. Until finally for the past 8 months I got in with an Internal Medicine doctor. Mainly he has been focusing on putting all the opinions together and managing my symptoms as most of imaging and blood tests come back normal even when symptoms like swelling are visible.  I am goal oriented and haven’t let this stop my life putting time into my studies to maintain my 4.0. But I knew how I feel isn’t normal. My doc diagnosed me with chronic fatigue syndrome due to my fatigue symptoms but now is revisiting the diagnosis because of new symptoms to now include.
Recurrent Infections : scalp, underarms, eye, sinuses, ear (take antibiotics every day still have symptoms)
Severe Fatigue
Breathlessness : normal chest xray
Bone pain
Chills
Swollen lymph nodes on neck
Bruising
Now my doc at my last visit mentioned hematology at my last appointment as well as immunology. My question is with a normal CBC and US of my nodes should I just go with immunology? Or is leukemia/lymphomas still a possibility?
