Can you help me please as I am somewhat confused.
.
I am 39 years of age and have been a Police Officer for 20 years.
.
I was first diagnosed with depression in 1991, 1994, 2001, 2003 and with Bi Polar II rapid cycling in 2007.
.
I was put on various medications which made me very ill and lost faith in my doctor.
.
I since have seen a new doctor who states that I suffer from chronic dysphoria and show signs of boderline personality disorder.
.
Since 1991 I have had nightmares and flash backs from traumatic events I have witnessed as a Police Officer.
.
In 2001 I was involved in a custody dispute and divorce. I was awarded custody of my two children however my elsedst son tragically past away in a car accident in 2006. I have since been declared bankrupt and lost my house due to my legal expenses
.
Since 2001 my mood swings have been getting worse. I suffer from severe anxiety and depression which can switch in seconds to rage, explosive anger, and then back again all with in a short space of time.
.
I have always since a child been extremly sensitive and emotional.
.
All my relationships have been very volitile and I either love them or hate them. I can become very jealous and possesive to not caring at all. 
.
I started self medicating with pain killers to put me on a high and recently overdoses on xanax and was hospitalised.
I have a benzo addiction. I have managed to ween myself off xanax however.
.
My depression and anxiety are worst in the morning and my mood switches very quickly for no apparent reason. My last girlfriend  stated there were several different Matts or moods that she has witnessed with me.
.
I tend to chase adrenlin charged events hence the Police Force, and I train for hours in the gym for that high. In 12 months I have sustained two broken arms, broken foot, broken nose which required plastic surgery as it was almost torn from my face. These injuries were sustained playing rugby and one was work related.
.
Despite having broken arms I would continue to lift weights at the gym and try to play rugby. I knew the risk but didn't care.
.
At the moment I am off work. I am currently on Bupropion, zoloft and avanza. I think you call it by another name in the USA. Remerton or similar. I am also on clonazapan and the plan is to slowly get me off it.
.
I have a poor body image and low self esteem. I am very strong willed and stubborn to the point where it can cause problems with work and relationships.
.
Since being on this medication I know longer have the rage, aggression or agitation. I suffer bad anxiety and depression and do have mini highs that come and go through ot the day.
.
I am confused with my diagnosis. Am I bi polar, BPD, or just reacting to a series of tragic events.
