Hi everybody,
 I have been wanting to write to anybody who can help me with this for sometime now but i think its too much now.I have been married to a usa citizen for the last 9 mnths and i recently got my conditional green card.Things were never really awsome between us but it was adjustable but now its come to that stage that i am going through extreme mental pressure and one of the reasons she is doing that is because i have not got a job yet and its not for lack of trying .The problem here is ,this woman is probably had a bad past atleast thats what i guess,so everything i do is a problem for her.If i got out ,the question arrises"where did u go",iif i stay in the house.."the qeustion is what the heck are you doing in the house"and if i talk back she comes up with filthy language and also sometimes a bit physical as well and if i start to talk back ..immediately she threatens me ,"dont forget ..that if i want i can cancel your conditional green card and kick you out of usa.And now its becoming scary for me to even talk to her ,because its almost like she is waiting to get something out of me to attack me.I know that even though i am a condtiional green card holder i have my rights in this wonderful country callled usa.I live in california and i want to do something against this because now am even gettting scared about my life ...because she is a very aggresive woman and if she does something ...which cannot be take back then...i loose and if i decide to get physical with her then i can go to jail.But am getting to that point where something has to be done or she is going to keep doing this to me.Please guide me through this hardship people.
 thank you
