I am 55 years old and in good health other than newly diagnosed high blood pressure (which is under control).  In the fall I had my annual pelvic and noted to my doctor that I had some very faint spotting.  He explained that any spotting or bleeding after menopause had to be checked and ordered an ultrasound.   I had the test and he said that he believed everything was okay but because i had so many fibroids I needed to have a D&C just to be safe.  He knew I was dealing with some dental issues and said I could wait to have the test until after the first of year.  As I was starting to look at dates for the D&C, I continue to have light spotting occassionally.   And when I say light... I mean really light.  Barely something one would notice but because I am post menopause it was something that sort of jumped out regardless of the minute amount.   In the meantime, I started having pain in my left ovary.  The same ovary where I had endometriosis.  I am now having the same type of symptoms I had when my endo was in full swing.  Ovary pain, back pain, bloated and gas.   Now that these symptoms have arisen along with the faint spotting I am very concerned.  I made a doctors appointment and will be on pins and needles.  I don't think he can calm the fear without tests but I guess I just want to know if there are benign conditions that can cause these symptoms.  Right now I'm convinced I have ovarian cancer.   If anyone has insight... it would be appreciated.
Thank you
