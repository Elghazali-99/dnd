long story short: i left and divorced my ex husband because he was emotionally and physically abusive. he doesnt bother calling, visiting, or paying his child support, i left when my daughter was merely a year old.....she doesnt remember him now (at 2.5) 
i have (using my own money and means) taken her THE WHOLE WAY to see him once, he was extremely offended when she didnt remember him and blew her off the rest of the visit....i wont do that to her again just to try and let her know him, obviously forcing it doesnt work
 as you know, most childrens shows have a two-parent household.....lately she has been saying the word daddy in her babble and play, when we are doodling, asks me to draw a daddy, and has recently started asking where her daddy is.....
 i have been changing the subject, but thats not gonna work much longer....
at the moment, shes too young to understand the logic, and i was thinking about just saying daddy lives far away
i know that when she is old enough to understand, i will tell her the truth, and not tell opinions....i dont **** talk her dad in front of her if at all, and i dont want her to base her opinion of him solely on what happened...i want her to be able to choose if she wants to meet him, but also know about the abuse without the abuse stories making her hate him cuz im gonna give benefit of doubt and say he doesnt end up like that with her
i also dont want her to hate me for taking her away from him, etc when she does get to know him.....and say she does like him, and he lies to her about it all....how am i supposed to know she will in her heart know the truth???
 i just dont know what to do and didnt know who else to vent to......thinking about posting in other forums as well for as much advice as possible...
