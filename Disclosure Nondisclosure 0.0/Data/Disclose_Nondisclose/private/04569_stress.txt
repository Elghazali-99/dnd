I am easily distracted, too. I can't stay on topic. (actualy thats how i found this site...lol). I guess you can call it skitzo, but i do talk to myself and here an old friend (who had died) talk to me. i can ignore the voice A LOT, but the memory problems and head aches are what i can't deal with. Sometimes my thoughts get so complicated my vision is blurred, i start to sweat, my heart races, i can't walk, i cant eat without feeling like throwing up, never get sleep, can't do school or house work, my mind races, my ears ring, my stomach flips, and my hands twitch. I hate it because when it gets bad enough i cant handel it. three times it happened at school and i had to be brought to the clinic in a wheel chair...but dad never came....even when he heard, he just said i was probaly acting. the nurses could see me on the bed sweating and clenching my chest, ready for my heart to pop. Once i was sitting down when a kid came in. he got me some water, but drugged it with his medicine so he didnt need to take it. i was throwing up for half an hour. unluckily, blacked out, he left, and the my dad said i was lying and i took the medicine to get out of school. Please, give me anythign, anything at all. I seriously do need help, and i know it.
