Go to my journal and see 'my psych ward story' for the background on this post.
 .This is about one month into my recovery, which I am now referring to as 'remission'.  I have felt awesome, and continue to do so.  I volunteer at a local thrift shop 4 days a week.  I clean my house while listening to fun music.  I go to the park just to enjoy being outside.  I shower, dress, make my bed, and eat breakfast every morning before beginning my day.  I practice stretching and meditation (outside when possible) regualrly.  I go to church, and am involved with church activities.  I can look people in the eye and smile and say hello.  I do not abuse my medication.  I keep a log of what, when, and how much I take.  That is a great way to keep track and to be sure that I am not missing doses or taking too much.  My family is overjoyed.  They have their wife/mother/daughter/sister back.  I look at all the fabulous changes and things I can do now that I would not do before, and i am amazed, as well as eternally grateful to God and everyone else who had a hand in bringing about my remission.  I will actually cook now, for myself and for the family (hated that before).  My loving husband bought me a beautiful watch encrusted with Swarovsky crystals in clear and aquamarine (I love anything blue) in celebration of the 'new' me.  Now, not only do I wear that, I wear every peice of jewelry I own!  I sparkle wherever I go, and I feel great about being a woman again.  I actually wear dresses and skirts now, when before I wouldn't bther with anything other than pajama clothes.  I hope there is someone out there that is  or is able to get to where I am! - Blu
