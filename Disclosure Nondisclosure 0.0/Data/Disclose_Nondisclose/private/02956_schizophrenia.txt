I am trying desperately to cope with my husband's paranoid behavior. I have been married to him for nearly 22 years and have tried to be supportive and understanding through his bouts of mental illness that include schizoid, antisocial, obsessive/compulsive and narcissistic behaviors -even when he focuses it on me. He has tried multiple medications, counseling, therapies -and nothing seems to work very well for very long. I am tired of being constantly verbally attacked and on-guard, and having no peace in my own home. I keep asking myself if I can endure this the rest of my life and I find myself secretly wishing he'd just die so I and my teenage daughter can have peace in our lives. I do not think that just leaving him would work as he can be very volatile and vindictive when he feels he is "wronged". He has never physically hurt me, but he has purposely broken things of mine in fits of rage. He thinks I am the source of all his issues yet he freaked out when I considered leaving him and threatened to throw my possessions in the yard and burn them if I did. Why do I stay? Marriage vows -"In sickness and in health", guilt because he depends on me financially, and fear of what he might do...Anyone else in this boat? If so, how do you recapture peace in your home?
