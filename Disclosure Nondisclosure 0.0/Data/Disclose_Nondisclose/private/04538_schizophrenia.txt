Hi, I have a question regarding my diagnosis because none of the labels seem to fit me...
 Here is some background story: Normal childhood, normal high school years with a bit of anxiety/depression but still highly functional, both academically and socially. 
Right after I graduated high school I started experiencing a severe depression which triggered anorexia for a couple of months. While the anorexia never got that bad, by the time I started college I experienced severe agitation,had  racing and derogatory thoughts, and OCD behavior. I went to the school's psychiatrist because I could not concentrate, and he diagnosed me with psychotic depression and gave me abilify and celexa. Eventually my condition improved, but the depression and random racing thoughts at night lingered (ie: "The president of the yellow french toast at 3 am"). 
 He has been treating me for three years now with different SSRIs, mood stabilizers, etc.. and still doesn't have a diagnosis of my condition. A few weeks ago I tried Geodon again with disastrous consequences on my nervous system, so I'm afraid to try antipsychotics again. I am scared that I might be developing schizophrenia as I have noticed a marked cognitive decline, and lately it is getting hard for me to form rational thoughts. I have never had hallucinations, thought broadcasting, or delusions... so I'm wondering if these random incoherent thoughts could be an early symptom of schizophrenia rather than a type of bipolar disorder. It is also getting hard for me to remember how to talk to my friends, how I feel about people, etc... 
 Please help, I am suicidally depressed over this whole thing and I fear it could only get worse.
