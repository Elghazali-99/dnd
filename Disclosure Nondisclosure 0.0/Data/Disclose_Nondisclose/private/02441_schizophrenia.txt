Ignoring all sense and reason I am 6 months into an intense relationship with a 35 yr old schizophrenic male. Unlike much of what I've read, he is extremely loving and actually works hard at solving relationship problems. He is kind to the soul. He has lied, but opens all doors of his life to me, ie: I've met with therapists, doctors, probation officer, etc. He has many most common symptoms and says he regularly hallucinates 4 people, but his symptoms are not obvious to onlookers except for fidgeting and need for constant stimulation or distraction via television and music. 
 HUGE PROBLEM:  He finally admitted what I've not wanted to admit.  He has no sex drive.  Says it's since taking meds-Seroquel, Abilify, Neurontin, Depacote, Buspar, Lexapro, Kepra, for the 1st time 1&1/2 yrs ago. I don't know if his low sex drive is due to meds, illness, or both and does it even matter?  I've been alone for 10 yrs and sex is extremely important to me.  I do not want to feel frustrated all the time, resulting in my disliking myself (anger) and arguments. 
 QUESTION:  I don't really know what to ask, except is there any hope for us? Do conditions usually deteriorate? Does libido ever improve? Am I out of my everloving mind? I probably already know the answers.  Bottom line is that this will probably never change. I should engage my head and not my heart and do the smart thing. But it hurts. I care deeply about this person and do not want to hurt him, myself, or my daughter who also cares for him. 
 Please please advise.  Thank you so much in advance, I am in a bad way.  Gale Sue
