For quite a while I have been waking feeling depressed, sad, helpless, powerless, and with a feeling
that there is no hope for changing this.  After I get out of bed I begin to feel better and most of the
time don't feel depresed for the rest of the day.
 I am on medication and have had about 28 years of off and on therapy...mostly on. :)
 An odd thing happened this morning, tho.  I woke feeling as I usually do, but after a few minutes,
I began to feel angry.  Strangely enough, the depression and all the above other feelings went
away.  (I thought I had found the magic "pill.")
 But after maybe 10 minutes of that I felt very scared.  I think feeling angry brought about the fear but I'm not sure.
 I wonder if I could use getting out my anger to help alleivate the depression?  If that is a possiblity,
how  would I do that without feeling scared?
 I don't even know if this question makes sense.  Lately, I have gone from having a normal self-esteem
to feelings of worthlessness and second- guessing myself..  I am 62.  Have been dealing with a variety of disorders like agoraphobia, panic attacks, very bad anxiety and a few years ago diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder.
 I've been dealing with these various disorders for 30 years and through therapy and working on learning to like myself my self-esteem had actually grown over the years.    I don't ever remember feelings of feeling worthless or constantly secondguessing myself before. tho, before or after these different disorders began.
 Thank you for any insight. Sharon S.
I started with one question and drifted into almost a 2nd one.  Maybe they are connected somehow.  It irritates me that I'm having these 2 new symptoms after all the work I've done.  Perhaps that is where the anger came from.
