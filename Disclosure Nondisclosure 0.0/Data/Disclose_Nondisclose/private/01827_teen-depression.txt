My name is Melanie, I'm 16. My paren'ts are divorced and i currently live with my dad and he "wife" which is really his fiance. She treats me so bad. Emotionally. I feel like my dad doesn't listen to my feelings or care about me as much as he used to anymore. My dad's fiance is the one making me most miserable. Let alone i don't see my mom anymore. Anyways, to start off, i just want to say, i know i don't have it as bad as others, it still emotionally breaks me down.. Well, today, she decided to take my clothes out of my closet and drawers and told me to put them back, she and my dad tell me that my biological mother never wanted me which i know is a lie. I know her very well. Although i don't see her often. She never lets me do anything on my own, i was just barely allowed to pick out my own clothes and do my own laundry. My friends stayed the night and we all slept on the floor to keep it fair so nobody was left out and they spilled juice on the blanket. So i asked to get a new one, and it turns out that i wasn't allowed to and I was the one who had to sleep on it. She told my dad that i said i don't love him.. Really?? That's not true. She stopped me from seeing my family. Which i still fight for that right. When her son hits me and i hit him back, i get in trouble. And she makes me do sports when i don't feel confident. And one thing i really get hurt about, is that she doesn't encourage me enough when it comes to school. :( But its okay, i don't love her or have any feelings for her. I just wish i had my dad back in my life. All he cares about is his cigarettes and alcohol. And of course, "The love of his life."
