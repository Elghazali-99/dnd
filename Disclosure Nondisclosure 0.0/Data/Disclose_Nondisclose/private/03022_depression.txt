Hi.. i am 30 years old now.. Normal blood pressure and no diabetes at all.. i had my first panic attack at the age of 24 and it's after-effects lasted for about 6 months .. i had to take inderal, xanax and multi-vitamins as prescribed by the doctors i went for checkup.. but a couple of months ago i had my next panic attack which was very severe that i am having a severe confusion eversince .. i am not having any memory issues.. i remember everything and my short-term memory is not affected aswell.. i just seem to be confused all the time and sometimes i feel disoriented and out of body experiences specially when i go to a shopping mall or a large super store.. it's been a couple of month and the confussion after that panic attack has not subsided.. i can not take xanax now because i already feel quite sleepy or depressed most of the time.. and i am not anxious at all just confused .. what could be the reason of this chronic non-going confusion ? P.S. i had ETT and ECG done back at the age of 24 and everything came normal
