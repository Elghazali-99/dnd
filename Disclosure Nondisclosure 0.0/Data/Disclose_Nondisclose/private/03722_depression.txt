I get terribly depressed a few days after starting my period, and am looking for someway to manage it. I get sad and start to hate and doubt everything in my life - my job, where I live, my relationship, what I am doing with my future. Though these things are always at the back of my mind, at this time of the month, just thinking about them makes me want to cry. I could sit around all day and do nothing, and just feel awful, and like everything is hopeless. Then in a few days, I am fine again. 
 Some background info: I am in my twenties. I tried a few types of hormonal birth controls a couple years ago, and they have made me awfully depressed too, and I stopped taking them each time after two or so months.
 I just don't know what to do about it, but I hate feeling this way. And my poor boyfriend has to go through these mood swings of mine and listen to me complain and cry and start arguments, due to no fault of his own.
 PLEASE... any advice or people who have dealt with a similar situation? Is there anything that I can take that would help me feel better? Would maybe getting on birth control help even my moods out eventually, if I could suffer through a few months of feeling really awful?
