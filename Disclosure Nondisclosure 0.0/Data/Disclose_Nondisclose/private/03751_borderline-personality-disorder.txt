I do not want to accept that I have BPD, but at the same time I want so badly to have a reason other than "I'm a huge *****" for the way I act and the things I do. I confuse myself with my own emotions and how often they change. I am scared to tell anyone the depth of my issues, because honestly I'm quite good at putting on a good face and coming off normal to everyone. I've recently had the urge to cut, which I have never wanted to do and actually used to criticize those who did. I never understood the reasoning until recentl when the thought overtook me. I also have a weird question. And this is gross, so prepare yourself. I pick...at scabs...constantly. I always have, ever since I could remember. I have scars all over me from it. My legs, arms, shoulders, back, face, neck, scalp, everywhere. Anywhere there is even a possibility of opening my skin, I pick at it. It gets worse...I eat them. I cannot tell you why, because I have no idea other than I always have, so I continue to. So I pick, and I eat. It doesn't phase me. I don't think of it as gross or unsanitary, even though I know for a fact it is. I just do it. Most of the time I don't even realize I'm doing it. I even do it in my sleep, and I know this only because I wake up with bloody fingernails and blood spots on my shirt and bed sheets. Is there a reason for this? Has anyone ever heard of it? Do I tell my doctor or are they just going to chalk it up to bad hygiene and twisted mind? I don't know what to do...
