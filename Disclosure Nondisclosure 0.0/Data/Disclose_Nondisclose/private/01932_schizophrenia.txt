Lately since I have started this new medication (Risperdal), I have had two rather weird incidents. One was in the hospital:
     I was sitting in the group room getting ready to start the next group session when out of no where a force took over my body. I started fidgeting and crying almost instantly because I was scared. I got up and walked out of the room, hitting my head and crying. I found out that it was my most powerful voice, The Teacher, trying to talk but she was unable to. She started getting really angry and I could feel the tension rise up in me. It was definitely a scary situation because I felt like I had no control. The nurse told me that when my voice was trying to "tear out of me" (my words) my eyes were extremely dilated.  
Another one of these incidents, though less intense, happened just the other day:
     I was sitting outside and I started hearing The Teacher again, though I could barley hear her. It was like my medication was muting her but not enough, so she still had the power to get through. It was like this extreme power took over my body for 5 minutes that made me feel very uneasy. 
 I am confused about both of these events. Has anyone else that has voices experience this with medication before. It is crazy weird. If you have questions just ask.
