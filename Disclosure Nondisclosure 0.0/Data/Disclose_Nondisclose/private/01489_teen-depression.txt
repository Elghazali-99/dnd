I'm an 18 year old girl and a senior in High School. Ever since my junior year, I've been going through these weird phases of feeling super down. No one really notices because I try to hide it during the day but it's difficult when I'm home and have time to think by myself. I have few friends and the ones that I have are all boy crazy and head over heels over their boyfriends. I haven't even spoken to them in a while because they ditch me for their boyfriends and i'm always the 3rd wheel. I have no interest in dating and popularity like my "friends" do and I feel like I can't relate to anyone and feel super alone and unwanted in my group. I also have a few acne scars and red marks on my face and have become obsessed with worrying about my appearance. I feel so ugly and fat. I try to eat very little and just want to be thin and pretty so badly to the point of making myself puke. My whole family thinks i'm antisocial and always in my room now. And my grades have been dropping and i I don't get joy out of the things i used to love. I've also gotten into cutting these last few days.. I don't know I feel like so many people have it bad and I'm over here complaining over little things but I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I've been crying so much lately..
