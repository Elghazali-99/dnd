I have been married for 5 years. For the past 4 years my husbands family (4) has lived with us (us+2kids). The family has caused much discomfort in the home, I feel like most of our arguments are due to external issues. I have told my hubby that I am unhappy with the living situation and he keeps saying it will change. It hasn't changed in 4 years, I honestly don't think it will change anytime soon. My hubby acknowledges the issues at hand. I do feel he has a sensitive spot for his family. They do not work and haven't really tried, I'm kind of at the breaking point and want a separation. I believe we have a good marriage but because of the family living with us our marriage is ruined. He says he communicated to them that we need to separate, I'm just not sure the message was acknowledged.  I know I haven't given much details as the actual issues but just living together stirs up all kinds of things. I'm at the point where I will leave my own house with my kids and not return. I told my hubby that and he's like "let's see when they move". I don't have much more patience. I'm tired after work and need my space. All responds are greatly appreciated.
