So I know its 2:30 am of course I can't sleep , I'm 20 years old I've relapsed once since 11/16/2013 by smoking a perk 30 ( my first time ) I didn't like it at all .. I honestly wish I wouldn't have wasted my time smoking it and just popped it . anyways I was only addicted for about a year but heavily addicted at that popping up to 7 dalaudid 4s or 3 30mg perks a day . kicking it without any help but 3 days of rehab was the hardest thing I've ever done but well worth it I guess .. I suffer from severe PTSD depression anxiety disorder . I do not use that as a crutch to why my addiction started but I can say that pain pills made me feel a whole hell of a lot better about things and that's why I fell so deep . and now since I've told my doctor they will not prescribe me anything that doesn't put me straight to sleep for my disorders .. So I buy xanex when I can some days are better then others but I'm not sure if I'm buying them and taking them as a substitute for the pain pills or if I truely believe that it "cures" my troubles .. That's just a piece of my my situation and now here's my question . why is it that I can't remember anything anymore ? I mean anything and I feel its only getting worse I'm wondering if I'm mentally blocking things out of my brain because I'm not using to suppress my disorders or if its just something permanent from my use of opiates ? My eye sight has gone to **** and my balance is horrible I also think I suffer from tremors that is also progressing because not only do my hands shake now but from time to time my head does also and I have no control to stop it Has anyone else had this problem ? I'm still recovery mentally but physically my withdrawals are over thank Jesus . and does anyone have advise on what could help with this.
