I'm not sure if i'm depressed or not, I'm an 18 year old school girl i live a normal enough life nothing out of the ordinary and im unsure whether i'm just looking too much into it or am i genuinely a little depressed. It's not all the time though it just comes and goes out of no where for no reason for example today i had an unusually relaxing day and out of no where i started to feel really low about myself i didn't want to talk to anyone when i did speak it was after being spoken to an i was being rather snappy and short in my answers and i lay around doing nothing then several times i would start to cry for no reason and this isnt the first time things like this have happened and when it does happen i always think of suicide (now not actually doing it but i just imagine it) i feel like im crazy thinking im depressed because its not an everyday thing and my mind being depressed is like not being able to get out of bed in the mornings but could this be some mild form depression and should i talk to someone because at the moment i havent told anyone this and i dont want people to think im looking for attention because to be quiet honest i'd rather people not know!
