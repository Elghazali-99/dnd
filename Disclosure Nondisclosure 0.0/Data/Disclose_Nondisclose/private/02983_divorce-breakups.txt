I've been married for the last 18 years . The marriage has been a stormy one from the first year itself. I guess in ways I was made to feel inadequate , be it as a husband eho shares less spends less & is a bore . The years have been spent in correcting my deficiencies. I didn't take her out much , I don't socialize much etc etc . From the fifth year onwards , she had been wanting to separate file for a divorce as I was inadequate in almost every field. in the last 7-8 years after I lost my dad (I had a breakdown), I somehow found my self respect took up  photography & practiced yoga , I gained my self confidence. 
Things got better , issues used to still crop up but I handled them better & more positively. Now that my son has grown & I still feel I am unhappy in this relationship , I feel I should walk away. What scares me is the thought of being all alone in old age or maybe regretting my decision . Im 43 now. Im a bit of a loner too but I crave good friends & yes love & companionship.
