I know it is so called normal with my BPD, but I don't have it under control at all.  I have manipulated my current psychiatrist in order to not be committed into believing I do, but it is destroying my marriage.  Please I don't know what to do.  I am still self harming occasionally, very depressed, but I do still get many manic episodes, and do the I hate you, don't leave me with my husband.  I don't know how much longer he will deal with my bull, and how much longer I can hide my true self from my children.  I get so so irritable, I have to go into the basement, and take it out on my punching bag so I don't yell at my kids, but I still feel like I lose my patience with them to easily.  However it makes me feel like I am the worst mother in the world, making my depression even worse.  I am in hell right now, anyone please how did you start to get things under control.  I do have severe severe trust problems, and trust absolutely no one which makes getting a therapist hard, I have gone through 6 this year.  My current is probably the one I have seen the longest ever.  She did explain to me, that for this problem the trust issue is normal for me, but I feel such guilt for not being able to trust
