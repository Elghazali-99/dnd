For the past few months I have been feeling very down. I am a 17 year old girl and I'm not saying my life is very rough by any means but I am going through a rough phase. I constantly think about suicide and near the end of last year I took 14 Panadol, several neurofen and several other tablets that I found in my house that I didn't know what they were used for but my attempt failed, I got sick and that was it. I cut myself with a razor every so often to make myself feel better. I've lost interest in everything I've ever liked and my schoolwork has gone very downhill. My friends in school are acting very mean and ignoring me a lot of the time because they are more interested in getting a boyfriend and just exclude me from their conversations. I am miserable in school but I pretend to act fine in front of my parents and grandparents as I don't want them to be hurt by the way I feel and by what I have been doing. I have told nobody and i don't think I would feel comfortable telling anyone either. I honestly do not know what to do..
