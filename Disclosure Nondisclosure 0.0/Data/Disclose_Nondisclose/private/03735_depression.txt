Hi, I'm wondering if you have any advice for me. I am 16 years old and have been unhappy for the past two years of my life. I am always miserable or sad or just generally in a bad mood everyday. I can't seem to find any happiness in my life and its awful. I come across as very ungrateful and I don't mean to be and people don't believe me when I tell them I think I have depression because my Mum and Dad take me on holiday and stuff and it comes across as I don't appreciate things and I really do. I have really bad anxiety issues that are taking over my life and I have symptoms of anxiety that make me worry I have something more serious and it is really getting me down. I should be happy, I have everything I want in life and more but I just can't seem to be happy. I have an alright friendship group at school but I'm not popular and that really gets me down. I rarely go out or get invited places and I don't seem to think my life is going anywhere. It just seems like a never-ending circle of nothingness. I have had thoughts about cutting but I never have the balls to do it. I do punch stuff a lot though. Please help, I want to be happy, its ruining my life. Any advice would be truly appreciated.
