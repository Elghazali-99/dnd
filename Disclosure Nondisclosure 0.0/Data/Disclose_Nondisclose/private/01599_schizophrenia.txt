I have one friend who used to be a therapist and another friend who is studying psychology in college. I described my past symptoms to them (hallucinations, delusions, insomnia, etc. starting when I was 13 and I recovered from these symptoms two years later...). They both told me that I probably have a sex hormone imbalance. So, I looked this up on the internet and found out that low estrogen levels can trigger psychosis in people who are predisposed to schizophrenia.
 One of my sisters has major depressive disorder, and another has rapid cycling type II bipolar. The three of us have different fathers. 
 So, a week before I start my period I self-mutilate, have crying fits, tics, delusions, suicidal thoughts, and paranoia. I don't hallucinate anymore and these symptoms last but three hours at most. I take 20 mg Citalopram (for panic attacks) and 150 mg Bupropion (for depression). Neither properly treats my symptoms. I feel better when I exercise, though.
 I haven't told my doctor, who prescribed these medications, that I experienced a two-year long psychotic episode. Should I tell him about this, and tell him what the input of my friends was? Should I quit my drugs? I want to quit; how do I "wean" myself off of these drugs? Should I buy phytoestrogen supplements?
 Thank you...
