so recently kind of crazy I did something that pissed my T  off, well im pretty sure and it wasn't the first time I tried to hurt myself seriously and things went bad, so I told my T, big mistake.  I went in and he said that I do things that "get peoples attention" that im "lonely and bored". I am probably not putting this in the right context so I went off on him about using the word bored and "getting attention" I told him I don't do this for attention, other people may but I don't and if anyone who knew me knew this they would agree, I am not some pathetic attention needing person who cuts herself for attention, I cut myself and do other bad things to myself because I feel bad, not some sort of other sick things, well he kept saying he didn't mean it that way, but in my mind that can be the only way. he says I should do things to change that therapy is about changing, well im not doing any better, so apparently that's my fault too, he even said he don't know whats gonna happen in future and that maybe one day I might give in to my urges to kill myself, I mean I just didn't think that was something a T was supposed to say to a client.  I guess I am a ****** client. im sure probably wishes I never walked into his office. he just wants me to take drugs to numb what I really am inside and maybe I wont ever be happy. I am pissed off and I told him that it was ********, but I am still pissed off, I don't know what to do
