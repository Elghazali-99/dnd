Hi there, ive been reading a lot recently on premenopause and wondering whether I am going through this or not? im 36 and im on the pill but just recently my periods have seemed to got more as being on the pill it made very light and lasted not long, but in November I had 2 periods, then again this month ive come on but its heavier than usual and has lasted 8 days so far which for me is unusual as I was always regular about 28 days and was never too bad? I woke up one night sweating and ive had a few hot flashes but nothing too bad? my skin sometimes feels itchy and ive had a few spots come up? ive also been a little forgetful lately and seem to get annoyed more and seems one minute im ok and the next I feel im going mad and could cry! I have been stressed lately too as I separated from my husband last year but its been very tough time as I have 3 children too and work hasn't helped either that's been a little stressful too, I did go to my doctors and ive had a blood test but I have to wait now? But im just wondering if anyone else has had anything like this? and if maybe I am? its just a little worring?
thanks.
