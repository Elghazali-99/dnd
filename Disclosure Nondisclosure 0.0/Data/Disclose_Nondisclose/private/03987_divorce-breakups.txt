I was married for three years to the man I thought was my dream man. Over the years he slipped heavily into heroine addiction. Our problems started 3 months into our marriage when he got upset that I sent a message to a friend saying I got married the whole conversation between the friend and I consisted of me saying I got married and he said congratulations and he was happy for me. When my husband found that he was connvinced I was cheating and interrogated me (literally) for two days. I wasn't allowed to sleep or eat while he pounded me with questions it finally got to the point that I confessed to things I never did just to make it stop. I know I should have left then but I was pregnant. After that we were doing good but I slowly realized he was controlling where I went when and with who. I finally left but not before he slit his wrist in front of me our two year old and my. 7 year old daughter.  I have a protection from abuse order but I'm worried about what will happen when that runs out. I'm pregnant again and my biggest fear is him seeing my son and exposing my son to his crazy. Or my son seeing how my ex treats women. I have very little money and can't afford a lawyer so haven't filed for divorce because the custody part will override the pfa protecting my son. I really just don't know what options I have
