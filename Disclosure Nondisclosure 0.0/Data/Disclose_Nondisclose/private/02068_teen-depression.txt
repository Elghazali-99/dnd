For such a long time I've not even been sure who I am. I'm a compulsive liar and I have been for almost as long as I can remember, and I can't help it and I want to change. Ive only ever had one best friend and I'm not even sure he liked me. I feel like only my Mom loves me, and I've given her so much **** I don't know how she does still love me. My Mom and Dad have been separated for 10 years, and I still see my Dad, but he's so cold, I can't remember when he ever said that he loved me, and that breaks my heart. And I resent him at the same time because he has depression. And after feeling so low for such a long time I was diagnosed with depression and put on 50mg of Zoloft daily 2 about a month ago.
 I'm turning into my Dad, and that scares the **** out of me. He's a good person, but his depression makes him something I don't want to be. I'm confused about my sexuality as well, and I don't know when I'm going to tell them (Im 19 in four days) Theres a girl I'm crazy about, but I know she doesn't feel the same. But I know I could love a guy. There's so much going on (No job, University coming up, no money) I feel like there's nothing for me. I like writing, and that's seriously the only thing that keeps me going, because I tell myself once I'm finished my script everything will be okay. I've never thought about killing myself, but if I couldn't write, then I don't know what I would do.
 It's strange, because I'm terrified of getting older, but death I'm not afraid of. If I could stay like this forever then I could. Because I don't want to get older. I feel like I haven't even had a good childhood, not having many friends, always being complacent when I know if I studied hard I could be excellent. I just feel so confused and lost. And I fear the Zoloft won't help me. I don't know what to do any more. I'm so young, but I don't feel like I can go anymore.
