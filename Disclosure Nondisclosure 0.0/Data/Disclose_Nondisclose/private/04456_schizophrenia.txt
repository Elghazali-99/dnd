 Symptoms:
 •Believing that someone on TV or the radio is speaking directly to you or that secret messages are hidden in common objects (delusions of reference)
•Disorganized speech that is not logical sometimes

          Patient will believe at times he is the president and talks outloud to his "generals". Also while at work/home he will play out the role of another job (ie doctor and fill out patient paperwork, talk to patients who abviously do not exist).
