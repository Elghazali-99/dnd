Hello all.  I am a usual poster in the prostate cancer forum as I am a caregiver for my dad who was diagnosed last November.  Let me provide brief overview.  Diagnosed with local prostate cancer in November 2013.  Did radiation through Feb and March of 2014.  Once radiation finished, he kept worrying that it has still spread and treatment didn't work.  he hated radiation because he always had a full bladder and was told to hold it in a lot.  towards the end of radiation he got a bladder infection, but never told anyone about the pain or got it treated.  must have had it two weeks before end of radiation and before got any anti-biotics.  we were told by doctors this could cause dilusion.  four days after radiation finished dad was not himself.  Very distant.  at times asking what day it was and if he had eaten breakfast or taken his pills.  so not like him.  He drives and goes grocery shopping and cooks/cleans.  very independent.  In and out of the hospital twice in 2 weeks.  This past Thursday went to see his rad/onc who noticed a changed and had him admitted asap.  hes been in the hospital since Thursday night.  Every kind of test has been run, (CT, MRI, Xray, blood, urine, etc...).  The only thing that is noticed is the infection and they started him on an antibiotic last night.  Hopefully this starts to help.  However the problem now is he refuses to eat, refuses to talk, refuses to get out of bed.  When he does talk he tells us he is dying and its his fault and its too late.  To leave him alone and let him die.  All test results show otherwise.  I don't know how to deal with this.  He is week because he won't eat.  He thinks he is weak because he is dying.  Also, he says someone is killing him.  Someone in the hospital is putting something in his IV to kill him.
