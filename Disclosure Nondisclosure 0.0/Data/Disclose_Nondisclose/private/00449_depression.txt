I had depression on this incident..
 And if someone touch me i think that guy who touch me prick me with contaminated needle,, 
 I posted this thread to hepatitis and hiv expert forum..i think my palpitation came from this incident 
 I was on the hospital to check my blood sugar level and S Creatinine for my monthly check up.. The nurse open the new needle in front of me but i refused to use the needle that she open on me. The nurse then put the 1st needle on the table and she ask me to get a new needle and open it.. When i open the needle and fix it the nurse put the 2nd needle again in the same table where the first needle was placed.. Even a single second i did not miss to look away to that needle but when the nurse drawn my blood she inform me not look and i follow her. We are only two in the room and one patient is waiting outside. I check the table when i reach there. There is nothing in the table that time. 
 The nurse who took my blood was the wife of the man who was terminated in the company im working in.. 
 1.	Do you think I’m in risk if the nurse picks up the other needle or maybe if that other needle was used to someone else? 
2.	In your expert opinion do you think I need to forget about this thing and move on or I need to be get tested? 
3.	I’m thinking the reason she ask me not to look during blood extractions was because she will get her own blood and wants to transmit diseases on me. Do you think I have a reason to be paranoid for this case?
