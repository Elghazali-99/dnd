I have been on 112.5mg (75mg+37.5mg) for nearly 10 years. I have tried coming off numerous times but have always found the withdrawal too hard. Two months ago I started a new relationship and have been happier than I remember for many many years. This prompted me to have another go at getting off. I reduced to 75 for a  couple of weeks, then 37.5mg for another week or two, then alternate days for another week or so. About a week ago I stopped taking any and while I am still on the emotional high of a new relationship I am suffering many of the well documented withdrawal symptoms - brain freezes, sleeplessness,sweatiness, tearfulness etc etc etc. I have just started taking 5-htp 100mg daily and have also been taking vitamin supplements and omega-3 1500mg caps. 
 In the past I have discussed with my doctor but this time I am on my own. I know that her advice would be to start taking again immediately (she has been trying to get me to increase to 150mg daily). I am however determined to get off this crap permanently this time. Can anyone give me any other ways to reduce symptoms and any idea of how long I am likely to continue to experience the nasty side-effects of stopping?
 I find it very difficult to actually talk to anyone because I just become emotional to the point of being unable to speak.
