Earlier this year, my niece and her baby moved in with me and my family.  I have a 6 year old and a disable 19 year old.  Things were ok for a while, but in September her mother took her car because she didn't pay for the insurance. Since then, my stress from  chronic pain, a disable child and having her and the baby ALWAYS here in the house has become too much for me.  Lately all I have been able to do is think of all the ways I can end my life.I finally got the nerve to ask her to leave, I feel so guilty and horrible.  She came to me to help her, but I know she is feeling betrayed.  She can go back to her dad, but he is a drug addict who has anger issues.  But he also lives off my mother.  Her own mother wont help her, she wont even call or visit her.  I asked her mother when she took her car to give it back because I need to have her out of the house some, so I could handle my own issures, but she refused. My husband is very supportive, but he also wants her out.  I Hate  my self for turning her away.  What can I do? I've told  her how much I love  her and that this was my own stuff, that she didn't do anything wrong. HELP I HATE MYSELF.
