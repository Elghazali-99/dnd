At the beginning of the year I moved in with my mum after telling her about how my dad abused me for 8 years. Since I moved away I have lost interest in a lot of my hobbies, I used to love reading and writing but I haven't read a book for a while and it's been about 6 months since I wrote anything. I spend a lot of my time away from people recently and Im hardly ever happy. I have a low self esteem, I won't post a picture to facebook unless I've used filters and edited it, I find it very difficult to talk to people about my problems which is why my step mum(who I don't live with)has recommended using a forum. I spend most of my time in my room and often cry, a month ago I was self harming because I couldn't bear y life I was having problems at home and school but I couldnt talk to anyone. When I told my family I had been self harming they all judged me and it made me feel worse so I did it again, I have stopped now but there are times when I hung about cutting again or ending everything. My mum said I might have depression but I don't know.
