CONTINUED FROM PART ONE.
Then the grandchild moved into their house.  They tried to make him as comfortable as possible.  They made him a nice room with all the things that would make him happy.  They tried to show him how he could have a good future.  They tried to teach him to save his money and to have good work habits.   
The story is not over yet.  The end of the story really depends on what the young man wants for himself.  Does he want a good life or a life like his parents?  Will he do the right things or will he be like them?  Will he see that his grandparents love him and can give him a future or will he want to use them and once again betray them?  The end of the story is really up to him. 
He holds the key to his future.  They can only hope and pray he wants a good life. 
Now it is a year since this young man once again became part of his grandparent's life. 
During that year he had to look after himself for four months because his grandparents went to Florida.  He got up very early every day and went to work.  He washed his own clothes, made his own meals and took public transportation every day.  He took really good care of everything his grandparents entrusted him with. 
He saved all of his money during that year and never wasted anything. 
He became a good driver and his grandparents gave him a car.   
He became very good friends with the children of his grandparent's best friends.  He built a wonderful relationship with them and they learned to love and trust him dearly. 
He started to enjoy learning where he came from and where he is going.  He started reading books and became 
religious.   
He showed his grandparents how they could and should trust him and they became very very proud of him once again. Everyone learned to love him again and to know what a wonderful, kind, intelligent and caring person he was. 
His grandparents were so proud of him that when they talked about him they sometimes cried.  Their pride was so great. 
His grandparents are looking forward to the next chapter in his life and can only pray that he continues to grow and know that he has a wonderful future and they are so proud of him. 
This past year was one of his grandparent's Best Years and hopefully every New Year will be filled with the same pride for his accomplishments. 
MAY 8TH, 2009 
AFTER FOUR YEARS OF LIVING WITH HIS GRANDPARENTS HE SAVED HIS MONEY, WENT TO SCHOOL, WORKED HARD AND FOUND A LOVELY GIRL WHO HE HOPES WILL BE HIS FUTURE BRIDE. 
IF THIS YOUNG MAN LEARNS ANYTHING IN LIFE I HOPE IT IS TO CARE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CARED THE MOST FOR HIM AND GAVE HIM EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT LIFE HAD TO OFFER. 
ALTHOUGH HE IS LOVED AND CARED FOR BY TWO GRANDPARENTS WHO TOOK A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT TO SHAPE HIS 
LIFE AND SHOW HIM HOW MUCH POTENTIAL HE HAS, HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO RETURN THE LOVE AND CARE THAT THE PUT INTO HIS CHILDHOOD AND HIS WHOLE LIFE. 
IF THERE IS A GOOD G-D, HE WILL ONE DAY KNOW THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A GIFT OF WONDERFUL, CARING GRANDPARENTS WHO BROUGHT SO MUCH GOODNESS, KINDNESS, CARE, LOVE AND GAVE SO MUCH OF THEMSELVES THAT YOU NEED TO RETURN THAT TO THEM EVERYDAY OF YOUR LIFE. 
YOU DO NOT NEGLECT THEM, YOU DO NOT TELL THEM THEY ARE CONTROLLING YOU, YOU CALL THEM DAILY, YOU REMEMBER THEM 
ON THEIR BIRTHDAYS, FATHER’S DAY, MOTHER’S DAY AND MAKE EVERY DAY SPECIAL FOR THEM, AS THEY DID FOR YOU ALL OF YOUR LIFE.  YOU SHARE YOUR LIFE WITH THEM AS THEY SHARED THEIRS WITH YOU.  THE HOLIDAYS AND SPECIAL TIMES THEY GAVE TO 
YOU SO UNSELFLESSLY, YOU RETURN TO THEM BY GIVING OF YOURSELF.  YOU GIVE BACK WHAT YOU RECEIVED ALL YOUR LIFE. 
YOU REMEMBER ALL OF THE THINGS THEY DID IN ORDER FOR YOU TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE AND YOU RETURN THAT BY GIVING THEM YOUR RESPECT, TIME, CARE AND LOVE.   
MAY 2010    -Now this young man is married to a lovely girl.  At their wedding he had his parents give him away. 
He is not in touch with his grandparents very often.  He says he is very busy with work and learning 
to communicate with his new bride.  His grandfather was very ill recently and he was too busy to call 
to find out how he was doing.  His grandmother left a message telling him his grandfather came through 
his ordeal but he did not call back.   Also, he forgot to wish his grandfather Happy Birthday.   
His grandparents built him an apartment when he got married because they did not want him to have 
the pressure of paying rent until he was making a better living.  They continue to try and make his life 
better. 
Does anyone know why this grandson does not give his grandparents the love they deserve?  What is
really going on here?  Would appreciate any comments, advice or opinions.
