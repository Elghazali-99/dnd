Hi everyone, me again!!!!
 I seem to be posting on this a lot recently, I think one thing is just leading to another. 
Basically, 2 months ago my periods came 5 days early which was odd for me as i was regular, my period lasted 24hours and was my normal flow. the next morning it was brown discharge for a few hours then vanished. that whole month after that i had back cramps and stomach cramps ( very mild ) and had all the period like symptoms for the whole month! i went to the doctors, she ran a test for diabetes which came out negative !! she advised me to go away and take a pregnancy test and if its negative go back for blood tests (which i haven't had the time to go back and do yet)! so yeah, it was a negative result! anyways, my periods then came 5 days early once again! but was a normal flow. and this month ive felt fine, ive been having regular intercourse. but a few days ago i noticed i got a strange cramp like a menstrual cramp, but i was not due, then i felt like i was bleeding, so i ran to the lo to find it was a watery discharge that had leaked through my panties and my jeans! which ive never had before? i had intercorse that night and the night after and everything was fine, but i had intercourse tonight and i felt sharp pains in my abdomen, i carried on until he finished. after i was in aggoney, and still am, i could hardley walk and ive went to lie in bed with a hot water bottle, its settled a bit but is still there... whats wrong with me :( !!!!!!!!
