My brother has had throat cancer 15 months ago.  However due to the extensive radiation treatments he had he now is having problems with his jaws.  
Shortly after the throat cancer he developed lung cancer and is being treated with chemo by an oncologist.
His teeth are bothering him for the last 3 months and his teeth are falling out as well as pieces of his jaw coming off into his mouth. He is in a lot of pain despite the medications he is on.
He has gone to pain mgmnt, was sent to several dentists that won't even touch him and today after his second trip to Mass General Dental they cannot do anything for him.
He is going to see his oncologist in the morning to try to understand why no one wants to treat him and why they can't pull his teeth out.
 He is preparing himself for the second round of extensive chemo treatments in a month or two and is ready to give up because of the pain. His Oncologist says he has a few years left.
He is 62 yrs old, good shape, and is giving up. He is on Medicaid and considered fully disabled in the state of NH.
Are there any suggestions that you can offer?
