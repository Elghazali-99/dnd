Hi, 
 This is maybe more of a question regarding stress and/or shame. Basically I am getting married in 6 months. we have been together 6 years and are very happy. I am 27 male and have only ever had sex with my girlfriend, until i had sex with maybe up to 10 females escorts over the last 18 months. At first it started because i needed to know what sex was like with another woman but this then led to various encounters which i am now terribly ashamed of. I've had STD and HIV tests that confirm I am all clear. With my marriage getting closer and closer I am becoming very worried I'm not going to be able to stand in church infront off all my family and say our vows. 
 I made a decision a number of months ago to try to move on as I don't believe I'm a bad person overall. I've made some huge mistakes but doesn't everbody. I really love my fiancee and definately want to get married. 
 Can anybody give me any advice. I keep wondering how people who cheat on stag do's and hen parties deal with this?!! Cheers
