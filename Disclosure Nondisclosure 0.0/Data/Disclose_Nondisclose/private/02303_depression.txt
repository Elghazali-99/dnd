I attempted suicide last March and since then I've been on Effexor. Ever since the incident, I had troubles feeling emotions, then thinking and then expressing myself and being able to study or perform in tests at the university as before. 
I still have this problem and I can't concentrate enough to read anything, no matter how much I try and would like to. This applies to any kind of text. I just scan it through. With the new semester beginning, I'm already facing problems and it's my final year - research project and lotsa writing. But if I can't even paraphrase in an in class exercise because I know that I know the words but I just can't get them down on paper and they basically escape me, even when I talk. I feel like a 5 year old. My answers are not of academic level as they once were. I get all jumbled up and I don't talk or I just put the pen down. I've also been wanting to study (not just because I have to) but I can't. 
 I can't help but wonder what's going on with me as I've had depression before and that never stopped me from performing before, and all this time that I've been taking Effexor I'm just not myself and I'm also wondering if Effexor could be causing this. 
 (My question is not exactly a question, I know)
