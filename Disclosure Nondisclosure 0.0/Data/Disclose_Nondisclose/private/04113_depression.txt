I am 26 with a 5yr old and I'm secretly pregnant. I am a college student with a decent work load. I live with my mom who is very negative, with my 1st pregnancy I lived on my own and when I told her she said 'well, I knew that would happen' and was even was upset about taking me to hospital to deliver because I lived on the other side of town. I plan to move out and live with my boyfriend in Jan, which is the soonest I can do this. I am 9wks pregnant. I have to hide my pregnancy symptoms, nausea, fatigue, cravings, morning sickness and anything else that may give it away. This is very hard, some days I just want to sleep and I've had the worst morning sickness ever all day. I don't want to tell her for fear of her negativity will push me over edge. My boyfriend works hard to provide, I still have to pay my mom rent and provide my own food, I am unemployed. I have a bff that I haven't spoken to in weeks after we use to talk 3-4times a week. After many unanswered text I gave up but, recently she has contacted me and I'm not sure how I feel about talking to her after being ignored for a week. Hiding a pregnancy and having no friends to talk to is very stressful and I'm finding it hard to be happy about this pregnancy. I want to be happy about it but how? I don't know how to get back to happy.
