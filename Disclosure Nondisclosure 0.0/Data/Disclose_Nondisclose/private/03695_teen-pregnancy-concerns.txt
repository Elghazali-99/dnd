I don't know if this is the right place to ask this, but I would really like an answer, so sorry. 
This might be a silly question, but I worry I lot and this has been plaguing on my mind for for some time now. 
 I have a habit of masturbating in the bath/shower, (where a stream of water from a tap or shower is directed onto the clitoris,) and I'm really worried that I can become pregnant by doing this. I always make sure to wait at least half an hour between other people's showers before I do it, and I don't use my hands. I only use the water. Before I may have touched the skin close to my parts, but I try never touch the actual bit. Also, I try to wash my hands really well before, even though I do not touch. I guess I'm worried there will be sperm on the tap, which will wash onto me via the water. As for where it may come from; I live with my parents and on and off we have had other male visitors to stay, who have used our bathroom. 
 I know this is a silly question, but it's something I get really worried about, and I need an answer. Also, any advice on how I can reduce my risks even further? Thanks so much in advance if I get an answer.
