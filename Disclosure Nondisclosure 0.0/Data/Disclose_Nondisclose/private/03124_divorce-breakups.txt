My current boyfriend and I have been dating for about 2 1/2 years. I moved in with him pretty much from the beginning. He wanted me there, and I wanted to be there. It was love from the beginning. It was when we started dating, I developed my drug habit. He was prescribed them, and I self medicated. Fast forward to now, I am currently a few weeks clean. I made the desicion to move 3 hours away to get better. I am living with my mom. Let's just say, this last month has been extremely challenging and difficult. I am battling this addiction and trying to return my life back to normal... Well as normal as I'll ever be. Let's just say, this month has been very difficult on our relationship. He has became distant, cold and bitter. We argue almost everyday. Now I know, it isn't healthy to argue everyday. Which leads to my point, how does one know when it's time to move on from the relationship? I love and adore him when we get along, which right now is about 20% of the time. The other 80% is hell for me. I am in too much stress, it's starting fo affect me physically. My hair is falling out, my appetite is lost, which is causing me to lose weight in an unhealthy way. I read somewhere, that recovering addicts shouldn't make any drastic changes in the first year. Well due to unfortanute events, my entire life has changed. I'm wondering how much more I can take before I have a nervous breakdown. I fear for my mental health. He doesnt seem to acknowledge this rough time in my life. It's very difficult. I'm starting to seriously consider leaving him and focusing on myself. I'm not sure I'm capable of that, right now he is the only comfort I have in this battle with my addiction.   Please any advice or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.
