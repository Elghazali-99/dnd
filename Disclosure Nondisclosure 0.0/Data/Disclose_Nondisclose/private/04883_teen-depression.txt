Without going into great detail, as my story would be far too long, my 15 y/o daughter has been suffering from depression for the past couple of years.  She's been in therapy for almost that long.  We have been through hell and I feel like nothing is getting better.  She develped a couple strong, unhealty attachments to an older girl as well a an older woman. She was compulsively lying, which it took her making false claims to this woman that I was abusing her, and DHS getting involved before that realization came about.  She has always been very emotional, and it seems like whenever something small happens with someone, or they don't treat her quite the way she'd like, she automatically assumes they don't like her.   She has a difficult time keeping people in her life.  She says they always leave, so she won't invest herself too deeply in any relationship, and usually ends up driving them away. There is some question about her having borderline personality, but she doesn't really have a history that would be consistent with what I have read causes it.   She had a small conflict with a couple people recently and based on her reaction to it, I feel like she's taking a huge leap backwards.  She's been pretty much failing her classes all year, and there's just no motivation to do any better.  Her room is disgusting, and I cannot get her to do the simpliest of tasks.  We started her on Fluoxetine a little over 4 weeks ago (20 mg) , but the past three days she has been nothing but tired and just laid in bed all weekend and slept.  I was told 4-6 weeks for the meds to work if they will, but I just don't see it helping. She told me last night that she has no will to live, but she doesn't have the will to die either.  She just sees nothing getting better or being worth working for.  It all seems utterly hopeless in her eyes. I too am ready to just give up, but I know I can't.
