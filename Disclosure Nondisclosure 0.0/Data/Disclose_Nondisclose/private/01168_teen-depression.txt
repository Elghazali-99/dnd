So, I am 15 years old. I have a beautiful sweet girl friend that loves me. We've been dating for about a year and a half. I have been fighting depression for around a year. I started smoking pot like 1 a month in seventh grade. No I'm a sophomore and smoke 2-3 a week. I stopped smoking for a month because I coughed blood. I went for the last week of it crying every night. I sometimes cryer for no reason I just felt useless. My parents are in a horrible marriage and my mom has to deal with it. My mom is the only reason why I haven't either left or killed myself. I have come close to ODing on oxy cotton to end it. I just passed out and threw up. I feel like I have no purpose living. I gave up my old lifestyle of friends and hooking up with girls I'd just meet for my girlfriend. I love her so much but I feel like somethings wrong. I have so much pain. I hate how she has to watch me tear myself apart. She hears how I feel and she cries and feels guilty. I want to just let go and get out of this continuous feeling. I have been sober for exactly 16 days and my relationship is near over. My girlfriends wants me to stay with her. I feel like I need to find real help now but I don't want her to see me go through this. I need guidance. I have so much sadness.
