Hello, I have a question for anyone who can help me. I was taking Celexa for anxiety I was only on it for about 3-4 months. I was also having issues sleeping and my doctor thought it was due to anxiety so that is why I was put on this medication. The celexa worked great but I had no libido so he took me off of it and put me on Wellbutrin and Ambien. I went straight from the celexa to the wellbutrin. After 4 days of taking the wellbutrin I started to have these weird dizzy spells everytime I turn my head, it is especially bad after I wake up, sometimes I even feel like I could fall over. I have not taken the medication in 5 days and I still feel dizzy. I called the doctor and he said that celexa can stay in your system for 2-3 days after stopping it and that it could be that both medications are in my system and that it should go away and I should start the wellbutrin again. He also said that ambien has a half life of 2-3 hours so it is not the ambien causing this dizzy sensation, also when I get dizzy my stomach feels like i'm on a roller-coaster. Today I had enough of feeling like this so I started taking the wellbutrin again to see if it would take this feeling away. Has anyone experienced this sensation and if so did it eventually go away? I feel that I am going to literally go crazy because I cannot take it anymore. Please, any comments would be greatly appreciated.
