I'm a 24 year old female and I've been experiencing some discomfort in my left breast. I've always had lumpy breasts with mobile/movable lumps that sort of hurt when pressed. 
A few weeks ago I noticed a relatively larger lump on the left side of my left breast, it isn't fixed, and moves around a little, and hurts if pressed. It doesn't feel irregular in shape, and is not visible without feeling the breast. 
Around the same time I experienced slight discomfort in my left armpit and could feel a small (around .5 to .7 cm in diameter) ball type movable lump, that hurt a lot when pressing. (bearable, but painful) 
It has been over two weeks since I first noticed it, and although the lump in the breast feels the same, but the one in the armpit became more solid, and immobile. It is closer to the skin and feels bigger in size, as if it has spread in way that if I raise my arm, the lump will be completely vertical in an almost-oval form. 
It doesn't hurt as much as it did before, but still hurts when moving the arm, or stretching it a bit. 
Another strange thing I noticed was that there's a line/thread type thing that starts from the lump and goes somewhere close to my elbow. It's a little hard to touch, and can even be seen a little when stretching the arm upwards. The diameter of this seems to be around 2 to 3 mm. 
 I'm not sure what this is, I've read somewhere that cancer can cause lymph nodes in the armpits to swell in a painful way, but the lump in my breast moves around and hurts a bit. But I'm still worried about what this is, am I right to worry? I cannot get it checked for a couple of months, that's why I'm posting it here for some advice.
