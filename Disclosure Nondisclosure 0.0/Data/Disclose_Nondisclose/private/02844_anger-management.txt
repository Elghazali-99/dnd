I am a 26 year old woman and I have been dealing with "letting it go" my entire life. Small things happen to me that I see other people take with a grain of salt but for me, personally, it makes me so angry! But i never lash out i just don't say anything and get so angry inside. Then i berate myself later for not standing up for myself. For instance, i went to play pool last night with a few friends and the waitress forgot our orders and one of us had to find her for her to remember to get it. Then, when she came she had the wrong order. We eventually left early due to the terrible service and when i paid i gave her a small tip (i almost didn't giver her any). The tip was around 10%. The service was terrible and i didn't believe I should have to give her a good tip for such bad service. When i gave her back the slip, she looked at it then looked at me and asked if there was something wrong because they work off tips. In essence she was asking why did I give her such a small tip.  I immediately became embarrassed  and upset that she was questioning me in front of all my friends and that she even had the nerve to question the amount of tip i gave her in the first place. I didn't respond i just walked out. I became so angry for all the things I should've said. And that she had the gall to even question me like that after the service she gave. Everyone in my group talked/laughed about it for ten minutes then moved on but i was fuming the whole night. For the rest of the night i was just angry. i wasn't talking to anyone or even enjoying anything after that. I tried to talk myself out of what i felt by telling myself it wasn't a big deal but nothing could change how i feel. Even the next morning as i'm sitting here talking about it i still feel angry. And this happens so often to the point where i get stomach aches. How do i cope with situations like this that occur in everyday life? How do i stop bottling up my anger?
