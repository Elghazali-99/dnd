Hi all, first post here so I hope I've not made a mistake..
 30 year old male..
 My GF noticed a small lump on my knuckle around 3 years ago, it has slowly grown and is now pretty huge..
 A few doctors have seen it briefly and said it's nothing to worry about, maybe a ganglion cyst
 As they wouldn't do anything or check it further, I attempted to aspirate it myself with 18G needles, nothing would come out and I tried around 15 times all over the cyst (I know, this was stupid) 
 This got me worried as surely it can't be a ganglion or it would have had fluid come out? so went to the doctor again and she ordered a ultrasound (I'm awaiting the results) but the person doing the ultrasound said it ISN'T a ganglion because it has echos or something.. I wonder if my repeated failed aspiration attempts could have made it look weird on the ultrasround?
 I'm worried sick about this now, having read about rare clear cell sacraoma etc.. I am losing sleep.. 
 I'm aware that I can't get a diagnosis off here but I just hoped somebody can maybe give some insight if I post a detailed description along with pictures..
 OK.. it's taken approx 3 years to get to the size it is now from being hardly noticeable..
 It feels hard, but kind of rubbery..if I push my nails into it it kind of feels like a thick fluid but I am not sure..
 It feels fairly mobile, I can move it side to side quite a bit..
 It feels quite well shaped, like a dome.. 
 I can kind of pinch the skin over the top of it
 It has NEVER hurt, never caused me any pain or any issues using my finger at all
 When I put a bright light directly onto it, it seems to light up
 Please help guys, losing sleep over this :-(
 HUGE thanks in advance
