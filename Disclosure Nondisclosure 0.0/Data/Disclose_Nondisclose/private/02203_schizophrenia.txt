Hey Im Kate and I have a few concerns... My doctor jus recently increased my effexor to 150 and just added wellbutrin 150... i have been on it for about 3-4 months now... the social anxiety has gotten alot better but i still have my moments with extreme nervousness and paranoia.. i also can sometimes become severely agitated and irritable... then theres the times where i am super sad and depressed... i also can tend to sleep for like 19 hours and eat alot... ive gained 50 pounds...sexual side effects are awful too i never want to engage in anything and my boyfriend is real frustrated about it.... my doctor also put me on ativan .5mg... i feel as though that dosage is too low and finding myself taking more and running out but im afraid to ask him for a higher dosage in fear he would think im abusing it....  i feel as though effexor and wellbutrin have been great for me but also feel as though half the time i feel those terrible side effects ive listed above... should i switch to something else or jus wait a few more months for it to totally kick in?-----Kate
