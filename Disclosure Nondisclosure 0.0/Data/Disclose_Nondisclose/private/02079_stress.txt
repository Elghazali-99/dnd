28 days ago i dislocated my  arm they shoved it back in and sent me home 
drugs that was used were morphine and madaslim
since then i had blood tests  to find out what was wrong with the side of my head 
the dr said no way nerves could do that... another 1 said no no no  the next 1 said yeh just give it time for the nerves to heal
i feel like they just want my cash and tell me a new story each time .. i ask can they perform a x ray or nerv test...  my dr said no  
then next.............. he gives me  anxiety pills saying its all stress >.>
it was like he wante me to hurry up adn leave cause our 10 mins was up but anywho im gonna take them:)
the pains like a tension in the  side .... sometimes moves to the eye and it feels bulgey and then the ear wich seems really odd...
first week i woke up experianced  confusion and dizzyness
passed after 2 weeks left this tension
i touch my shoulder the pain follows it to where its been touched.....well  i can feel my pulse
  first week i thought i was dieing or something cause the next day the dr was concerned saying ur bloods weird its enlarged red cels  and low vit  b is a prob  now the b 12 came back NORmaL and he just says its just stress  NEXT 
at least im slowly  feeling better  like cheerfully 
i get relief from showers :)  hot rooms ( up close to heaters)
 hmmm i wanna get a new  dr :'( ive wasted 700 $  seeing him
can anyone give me a hand ?
(also b 4 the arm i was seeing him for stomach cramps  after 2 weeks of  workout  eating healthy   and living it clean  with no alcohol >.>  i did notice a tightness in my  leg  joint...it was prob nothing:))
