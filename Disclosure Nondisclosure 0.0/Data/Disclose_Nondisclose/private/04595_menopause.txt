Hi all, I went to the docs recently having not conceived in 7 months, i have a daughter who is 7yrs old and we are finally in the position to have another child now.  My symptoms are as follows - excessive hair growth, pain sometimes during intercourse..not excruiciating just uncomfortable sometimes, no conceiving but we are really trying hard to...tried everyday, every other day etc.  The doc did bloods and they came back as LH 12.9 and FSH 21..but this was on cycle day 9...i had repeats on CD3 and they were LH 5.5 and FSH 9.9.  I got referred to a Gynae who has sent me for AMH test and also an internal u/s scan.  He said he was concerned about my FSH level being high for my age and mentioned early menopause, but also said it could be PCOS but the AMH test will say yes/no for sure. I have regular periods, every month within 2/3 days either side,  I have been so depressed since then and dont know what to do - my results for bloods wont be back for another 2 weeks and my u/s scan wont be done until 6 weeks time and then my follow up appointment is 8 weeks ! 
 What do people think about my FSH levels ? my first result was high at 21 but this was done on CD9...so the gynae saying he is concerned has me worried as i though on CD3 results for FSH were to be looked at ?
 Any advice at all please ? im going out of my mind !
 Thanks xxx
