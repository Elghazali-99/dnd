I am a 32 year old male. I have been smoking for the past 8 years or so, on and off but not heavily until the last two years where I started smoking between 10-20 cigarettes a day. I have recently quit. 
 For the past two weeks I have had a recurring soreness in my lower throat. No coughing. About four days ago, I began experiencing a lump-like sensation inside my throat on the lower right that is mainly felt when swallowing. It feels about pill sized and the sensation comes and goes to the point where it is sometimes barely noticeable. 
 Last night I started feeling a small swollen area on the right side of my neck where the thyroid is located. It is not visibly swollen but it feels that way when touched and compared to the other side. It hurts a little when pressed. The right lymph glad under my jaw also feels slightly swollen. I feel slightly feverish at times. There is some minor discomfort in my right ear if I am using headphones. 
 I found a list of symptoms which I will address below
  
    a change in your voice                          - Not that I noticed
    trouble swallowing                                - No difficulty but I feel a tiny lump when swallowing
    weight loss                                          - No
    sore throat                                           - Intermittent (usually in the early morning) 
    persistent cough (may cough up blood)  - No coughing or blood
    swollen lymph nodes in the neck           - They feel swollen but not visibly
    wheezing                                             - No
    ear pain
    hoarseness
 I am driving myself crazy with worry over this. I suffer with anxiety and depression, which is making this a lot worse.
