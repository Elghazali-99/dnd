So if you new that your wife had started to have feelings for another man.Is it wrong for me to be checking up on her she is just about done with a rehab program an my intuition has been telling me somethings not right. This program offers a yoge class which I thought was something they had to go to for the program. Well about a week an a half ago I found out its not a must go class. An another thing that was bugging me was it starts 4pm to 5pm an her must go class doesn't start till 6pm and she usaully leaves at 3pm to go it takes 20 min to get ther e .so it had really been bothering me many signs just on this one case we also have two children and one needs to be picked up by 430 well he was at home on monday an she said she was. Going to yoga my intuition said different. So I had an hour an decided I was going to go an see if she was there . All the way there I was so nervous of her being ther catching me checking up on her and the thought of being right. Well when I got there guess what she wasn't there. I finally told her yesterday I new she was skipping classes an lying to me. I asked her where she was an she says she was just driving around. Whicj is boloney driving around for 3 hours I think not . I told her I know a lot more then she thinks I know . But she won't come clean I know what's going on deep within but I keep giving her the benifit of doubt. Our marrage is on the rocks. Yes but yet were still having sex. I have always trusted my wife to be faithful. Is she just trying to spare me anymore pain or is it exciting to be on the sneak? I don't know but I think it would be easier if she just came clean. Cuz I'm going out of my mind when she's not at home. She also got all bent out of shape at me for checking up on her. Isn't that what a concerned husband should do if he thinks somethings wrong? I want to try an work out our marrage an I'm willing to forget about what ever is going on we have 11 years together an 2 kids. Any adivce
