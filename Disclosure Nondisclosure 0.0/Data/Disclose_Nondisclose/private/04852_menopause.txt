I am so glad I found this blog.  I began feeling ill 4 years ago.  I passed out in my kitchen and broke my nose, browbone, and severed the optic nerve to my right eye and lost my sight in that eye.  No hospital, no doctor NO ONE could tell me what was going on.  Every month right before my period I would get SERIOUSLY ill.  I was nauseous, exhausted, began having migranes and was either homicidal or suicidal.  I began bleeding so intensely I go thru 5-6 super plus tampons a day with the blood still running down my legs. Sleep is a thing of the past.  Sex is a thing of the past. Energy is a thing of the past.  I have gone to three different OB's and they confirmed I am in menopause but the last OB just looked at me when I described what I was going through and said, "I've never heard of that". PERIOD.  Are u kidding me??!!!!  Well, apparently you women have!! At last I can remove one symptom (thinking I was going crazy).  I have lost two jobs due to memory loss and confusion and am currently wondering who to foist myself upon next.  Until I read this blog my self-esteem was in the bucket because I thought I had early dementia.  And DONT GET ME GOING on those Viagra commercials!  If you can't get it up I DONT CARE RIGHT NOW so why are you taking those damn pills?!!!  I am taking my vitamins and forcing myself through my daily routines but I have lost any lust for life.  My insurance will not cover bioidenticals and they run around $60/month plus going to see the 'I don't know' doctors.  I guess I should be happy I still have the energy to be pissed off.  I will take any suggestions you have.   The last doctor told me to go back on birth control.  I am tired of doctors playing with meds to see if my symptoms are alleviated.  I get the impression they know about as much as I do about what is going on.
