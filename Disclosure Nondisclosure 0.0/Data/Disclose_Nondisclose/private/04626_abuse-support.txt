I've always wondered if my problem, that I seem incompetent and loony some of the time, which causes people to just discount me entirely, is brain damage caused by the severe emotional abuse I suffered growing up. They physically and sexually abused me, too. The depression I've suffered has ruined my life, but really, seeming like "A Joke" some of the time has really ruined me with school, work, etc. I'm an older student and I just applied to a prestigious grad school, submitting writing that was good enough to warrant a phone interview. I was nervous and I did run on a bit, but a lot of normal people would have done the same. But I think they called my one reference, my main professor, and I thought he was a trusted friend, but I have written to him "Have they contacted you yet?" and he has answered about another matter but won't answer the question. He knows about my mental illness. I try so hard to deal with people, and I try to like or love people, but my conclusion is that it doesn't matter what I do, people will ruin things for me if they can. I think I am a likeable and loveable person. I'm pretty and talented, but it doesn't matter because I'm damaged goods. I lead an exemplary lifestyle in that I don't do drugs or act out promiscuously or do anything mean to anyone. Life seems just about over for me.
