Okay so about a month ago I took I believe 20 pills of Midol, first 24 hours I felt my heart racing and started feeling anxiety. Then after I started vomiting, and started feeling pain in my stomach. I did not tell anyone that I took pills I just told them I felt bad. I guess I did as a cry for attention or help, I don't really know. My parents had to go to work so they left me hoping I would get better. I had later to go to the walk in clinic where the doctor wasn't helpful he just gave me some pills for anxiety and that's it. I just wanted to get rid of the pain or whatever. I started to really regret doing it, and decided that it was better for me to go to a hospital. So I did and after hours of waiting they finally put me on IV and did some urine and blood tests but they couldn't find anything wrong with me. They wanted me to stay over night but since I felt better I went home. The next morning I just went in for some ultrasounds but I already knew they wouldn't find anything. Monday of this week I did it again but now with Tylenol extra strength, same amount 20 pills, Dont ask me why cause that is one of the things I'm trying to figure out here. I would never want to go through the pain again ever, and I'm too scare to ask people I know for help. I don't understand it myself, I'm an excellent high school student, I have lots of friends, and a really loving family, people are ven jeaoulos of my lifestyle and I do feel overall happy. Something I should probably mention is that everytime I take this actions, I usually just had a fight with a friend or problems with my ex' boyfriend and his new girl. But I honestly don't even remember after a while that I had in fact taken the pills, like is just black in my mind and it takes me a while to remember why I'm feeling the way I'm, and that is what scares me the most, can I control this somehow? I don't want to die.
