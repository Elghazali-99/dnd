Here I sit. Locked door and that blinking red light keeps blinking. Unlike my eyes. Open wide and fixated on the one, two, three, no four bottles of pills. Every day this week I have tested them out. 5,10,15... Go to sleep . Then every morning at the stroke of 8 my eyes open. I curse it all. Here I am again though but this time the door is locked...the letter is on the table and that red light...keeps blinking. Stop little voice inside my head. Taunts and teezes like a pesty school kid. Do it. Just do it. I can't even cry now. I could before. So much I almost drown. Now its like the desert. Dry and cracking. The pain, the hurt, the breaking feeling in my bones, the cold and clammy hands, the tap tap tapping of my finger on the pill bottle lid. Make it stop. Now I lay me down to sleep...I don't believe in God so screw the rest. If there was a god would he have let unclean hands touch me or thick black belts crack against me. Would he have left me hungry and alone. Kicked like a puppy but keeps coming back like a fool. The thoughts are crowding me. I can't breath. I can't see. The red light is blinking. I'm thinking. I want to die. I really want to find the earth and put myself there and hope I come back as a beautiful flower.
