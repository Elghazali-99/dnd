I have always had irregular periods for the almost five years I have been having periods. However, I have not had a period for a little over two months. I am concerned about the possibility of me being pregnant. My boyfriend and I have never had penetrative sex, but have had oral sex. We try to be very cautious but there is a possibility that he may have fingered me with a very small amount of semen on his hands. I have taken 8 "first response" pregnancy tests between the first day of my missed period and over then following four weeks. All of them came back negative. However I have been feeling strange. I have experienced bloating, fatigue, and have had an itchy rash. The rash can probably be attributed to my allergies because I sometimes get a minor rash. The other symptoms are consistent with my period, yet I have not gotten it. I am worried however that since I've had other symptoms I could possibly be pregnant, or that there could be something else wrong with me such as a hormonal imbalance or something like that due to my missed period. I've heard about the possibility of Vitamin C and ginger helping to bring on a period, should I try this? I'm just very stressed and worried. Please offer any advice!
