Hi, im 15 and when i was 13my parents divorced and this had a big impact on my feelings, usually i would take things out by anger but also id keep things to myself. then at school i was bullied and got beaten up quite alot, and this made me i think depressed- i never left the house, stopped attending school, and i started to feel like i wanted to cry all the time, for no reason. Then, i moved schools and things started to look alot brighter, however i still had my down days. Then about 4 months ago i found out i was pregnant, i had been with my boyfriend about 4 months at the time and i told my mum everything. I had always been 100% against abortion but my boyfriends parents would of kicked him out... and i was too young to be a mum so i aborted my baby. it was discusting and i will never do it again. but i keep thinking about it and i try to talk to my boyfriend about it but he doesnt really understand coz he never came to any of the appointments, (also i had a scan and saw my babies heart beat and i think this made it worse) now i dont know what to do and i feel upset all the time, and no one understands. please help? ps counselling doesnt help i dont realy talk to people.
