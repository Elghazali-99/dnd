Hi....I realize this is an old discussion...... I've been looking for an answer but can not find anything.....
I've been taking Wellbutrin 75 mgs in the morning for 8 months now to treat my depression, went up to 100 mgs SR for a couple of months but the anxiety was unbearable (I was diagnosed 5 years ago with anxiety/panic disorder and depression) so my p-doc brought me back to 75 mgs/day. I am also taking 0.5 mgs of Klonopin twice a day (morning and night) for anxiety. I am very sensitive to meds and can not tolerate any other ADs that I've tried these last 5 years. The Wellbutrin is helping a little with the depression and I'm not where I would like to be, I still have bouts of doom and gloom feelings...... the good thing about it is that it's keeping my weight in check and I could even go down to 37.5 mgs (where I started) to decrease the norepinephrine effect which is making my anxiety worse. From my readings - and just like the previous post very well explained, Wellbutrin does not work on the serotonin levels and it's actually NOT prescribed to people like me who suffer from panic/anxiety disorders because it increases anxiety. I was thinking about adding a small dose of 5-HTP to see if that helps the mood, and if it helps maybe even wean off the Wellbutrin with my p-doc's supervision.
I have asked him the same question (about the 5-HTP) but - like all traditional pill pushers - does not know and/or does not want to give me any suggestions related to supplements.
I appreciate any reply/help/comments.
