I am not sure where to begin. i have been married for ten years now and for ten years my husband has made me feel like i don't matter. if i start to talk to him about anything he always interrupts me and asks "is there a point to this story?" i always say no and then he tells me to hurry up and finish it then. so i just tell him to forget it and quit talking. i dont talk to him at all anymore. he is always telling me i am worthless for simple things like forgetting to bring home a tomato for the burgers he was grilling. he is also very jealous. he has been accusing me of having an affair almost as soon as we got married. i would cry and tell him he is all i wanted until he finally believed me. i just can't do anything right no matter how hard i try. he is always mad at me. i have been told i am trash and even left outside of a trash dump late one night. i suffer from depression. i was on antidepressants for awhile. he called them my crazy pills. to him those were proof that he was right all along. that i am a mental case. and that is my biggest worry and what confuses me the most. i have never talked to anyone about this because i am afraid he may be right. what if there is nothing wrong with him and its really me. what if i am so bad that i deserve this treatment.. i know i am not perfect. i have said hurtful things back to him too. and that worries me too. how can i say he is abusive if my words were abusive too?? i am just so confused. i think about leaving him all the time but i am afraid emotionally i wouldn't survive it. he has made so many threats including turning my family and my church family against me so that i would have no one. he is very manipulative he can make anyone believe anything he says. he can twist my words to make is sound like i've said something that i never actually said. he is that good. i just wish i knew what to do.
