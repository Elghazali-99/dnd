Should I feel guilty for not liking my father?  He is so emotionally abusive that I can't stand talking to him for more than a few minutes at a time, although I'm not sure if he understands this. 
 I guess I should start by going through what makes him such a difficult person to get along with. As long as I can remember he has been putting me down constantly. If I'm enjoying something he looks angry and insults me. For example he hates that I enjoy cooking and yells at me when I'm looking at a cookbook or searching for recipes on the internet. If I cook something he refuses to eat it, or he'll take a bite and throw the rest away. He hates that I'm a music student as well, and demands that I stop playing or listening to music that I enjoy when I visit his place. 
 I have back problems that prevent me from lifting heavy objects or performing any strenuous tasks, and he makes fun of me for that as well! 
 These are just a few problems. He's also very racist, and is always trying to find me and say horrible things about other races to me when he knows that I don't like it. He's also sexist, and bigoted towards homosexuals. He also smells very bad because he only bathes once a week.  When I visit his place, he'll try to spy on me when I'm talking on the phone, or search through the guestroom where I stay at when I visit. 
 I just don't understand why he keeps trying to talk to me after I made it clear that I really don't appreciate his comments. There are other things too.. some really hurtful things he's said, but I won't get into it. 
 How do I let this go? And how can I avoid him without appearing rude?
