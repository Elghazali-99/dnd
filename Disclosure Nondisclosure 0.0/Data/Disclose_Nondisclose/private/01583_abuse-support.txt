My husband has been trying to stay clean from opiates.  Went to rehab in Sept '12, clean for two months, relapsed for 2 1/2 weeks starting in early December.  He has now been clean for one week.  We separated when I found out about his relapse (it's been almost 3 weeks).  I was contemplating ending our marriage due to feeling betrayed (plus pressure from my mother who is very controlling wasn't helping my decision), but have decided to give him one last chance to get it together for his family (we have a young daughter).  I wrote down some things that I want him to do for the next few weeks including attending AA meetings and rehab aftercare, passing drug tests 3x/wk, having a stable bank account, and seeing a counselor (maybe for both of us).  I also stipulated that he has to stay clean and do these things and then he can come home at the end of the month.  I said that he has to stay clean or I'm filing for divorce.  I feel guilty being so harsh, but I felt like it was necessary.  I know I have to follow through on my boundaries....am I putting too much pressure on him??  I just can't do this roller coaster anymore.
