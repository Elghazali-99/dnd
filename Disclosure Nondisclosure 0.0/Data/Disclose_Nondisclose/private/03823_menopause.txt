I am in a quandary about what to do. I have been without periods for seven years (I am 57) and two weeks ago I began having a period of normal flow and I went to see the doctor who told me it was probably due to the large amount of naproxen I was taking for pain. I have been having severe leg, back and abdominal pain as well as post shingle nerve pain. The bleeding has now increased to a point that I can barely get from the bed to the bathroom. I am also passing large clots. For the past 2 years I have been having tests to make sure I did not have ovarian/fallopian tube cancer because my mother had fallopian tube cancer at 55 and 2 cousins who died of ovarian/uterine cancer. I had breast cancer at 38. All of the tests PET scan, ultrasound, CT, and MRI that were ordered did not show any of my reproductive organs. I know I should have an internal ultrasound but I was told that my uterus is tipped and with all of the bleeding it would be difficult to do . I am taking iron, and eating spinach every day but I am scared.  Any suggestions?
