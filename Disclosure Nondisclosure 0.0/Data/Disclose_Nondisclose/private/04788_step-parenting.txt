I am 14 weeks pregnant with my fiancé. I have a 3 year old daughter from a previous relationship who's father is not around. I just found out today that my fiancé might have a 7 month old son that he didn't know about that was before me. He supposedly had a one night stand type thing with her and wasn't even sure if they actually had sex because he drank so much that night. They hadn't been in contact since until he started hearin rumors that the baby looked like him. Shes engaged to somebody. Am I wrong to be feeling upset and angry and wishing this kid wasn't his? I love him so much for taking on my daughter who isn't his but he knew this coming into the relationship. Am I wrong to not want to have a step child? I'm soon to be 23 and will have two young children of my own. I guess my question is how is this going to effect me and him? Is there anyone out there who can give me advice on how to deal wih this? How to possibly take on another child that's not my own? How do you step parents handle havin step children?
