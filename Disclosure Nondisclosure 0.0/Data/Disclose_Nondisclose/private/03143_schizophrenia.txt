My 18 yrs old son started college this summer,we live in NJ and went to NYU,staying there for 3 nights only,commuting from home for 2 days.For the last 4 to 5 weeks he says he is living in a dream like situation,everything seems like a movie.sometimes he cannot recognize his own parents,but he knows the reality and he is very upset about what's going on with him,he says when he presenting something,it seems he is not himself,someone else talking,but he has all the control,means he can control his talk,a psychiatrist is involved,who thinks,it's too early to make a diagnosis,it could be acute anxiety or something more serious,we can start him on very low dose of resperidone or we can wait.Now he is commuting from home and his father going with him on train and he is doing well in his studies,he scores are still 95 to 100%,we started him on fish oil,niacin and Mvitamins,What could be the diagnosis and prognosis? All his blood work including work up for anemia and lyme disease normal,utox negative,MRI brain and EEG normal.
