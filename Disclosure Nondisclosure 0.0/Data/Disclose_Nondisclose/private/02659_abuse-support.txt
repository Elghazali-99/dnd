When i was 15 i stupidly got dressed up and went to a nightclub with my friend i said i was stayin with this friend. Anyways while in outside my friend left me to hook up with a guy and i was left alone at 5am no one around and got pulled in the back of a car and raped. I never told anyone about this at the time as i thought they would say its my fault i shouldnt have been out a nightclub i was too young.
 However i then told people of this last year and got counselling.
 Now i never go clubbing and never drink, but one night i got depressed split up from boyfriend decided to go out get pissed. I got a little too drunk and can remember most of the night i know nothing happened to me in the night club as i was with my brother and sobering up.
 We went into the pub my brother works in we arrived about 00:25 i chatted with my friends for a few mins i met this girl went up stairs had a smoke and a chat then we went to the toilet and fixed this would have took around 15 mins we then sat at the table all my friends and had a drink then i went with my brother at 1am till he got his stuff when he finished. I can remember going in the smoke the loo the table and goin with my bro to get his stuff but i cant help thinking what if i was raped and i dont know?
 I remember goin in and going out and bits in between do you think i could have been raped again and not remember but remember before and after? and in this short space of time? Ive went over it in my head and there would have only been about 5/10 mins i cant remember but my brother probably would have notcied me gone as he is very protective and also i was wearing jeans and a belt and i dont remember these ever being off.
 What do i do i cant talk to anyone about this and dont want to start therapy again. Could this have happened or am i needin help?
