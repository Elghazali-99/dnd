Lymph node behind ear is enlarged... 39 year old MWM in NJ USA.
 I've had a general feeling of fatigue, headache on and off, slightly elevated temperature (usually 97.5-98.5 per ear, sometimes up to 99.2 or so, especially before bed).  Also slightly swollen, slightly tender tonsils.  I also have a generalized rash on my torso (faint pink, pencil-eraser-sized blotches that seem to get redder with activity or in warm shower).   These symptoms have been fairly constant for around a month. 
 I just noticed (no telling how long it's been there) a lump behind one of my ears (left).  I believe it's the post-auricle lymph node. My guess is 1cmx1cm, but who knows.  It moves around a bit... not rooted to the underlying bone, but attached to it, if that makes sense.  I thought it was sort of soft, but wife says it feels like bone, so that's no help.
 Because of the headaches and other things, doc took blood work and a brain MRI (no contrast).  Blood work 3 weeks ago, MRI 2 weeks ago.     
 I will go back to the doctor and mention the lymph node (as well as the persistence of the rash), but my god the waiting and stewing is interminable.  I just want to know.  Thanks for any help you can give. 
 My questions:
1. How frequently does a 40 year old get such swollen lymph nodes (and other stuff) that's just some virus?  That seems to me like a kid thing.  
    By the way, I'm no (or extremely low, I guess) risk for STDs, but I did get tested for HIVs, syphilis, HSVs, etc anyways to rule them out.  They were all negative.
 2. Would the blood testing that the doctor did have picked up say lymphoma?  Her nurse called and said that the blood test (CBC and mono) was normal.  I never asked her for the numbers, though.  Would lymphoma have been obvious?  Or could the numbers have been only slightly off, and the doc thought nothing of them without this further information (swollen node)? 
 3.  Would an MRI pick up anything that could be draining into that crazy lymph node behind my ear?
