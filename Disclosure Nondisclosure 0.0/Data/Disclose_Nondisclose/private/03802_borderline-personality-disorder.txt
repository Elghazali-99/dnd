I thought that being diagnosised with BPD would actually help me move forward but it hasn't, i try to educate myself as much as possible on it but all it does it educate me. I am still stuck in the circle and pattern of behaviours. In all honesty is seems i am stuck like this, my GP even said all i can do is learn to live with it, they really have no understanding how hard it is to live with.
I am never happy or content to just be, i am either desperately depressed or so hyper and agitated that i panic all the time. I can make realtionships with people but i will admit i have trouble keeping them the biggest thing for me is rejection i always assume people will reject me once they get to know me so i am a ***** and i back of before they get to know me i have been trying so hard to work on this but its not working.
My social worker was late for an appointment i was angry because i felt like she didn't care i almost walked out because i felt so hurt, i smashed up pictures and my house because my partner went to his friends house what is wrong with me.
Had a crappy few weeks avoided hospital again but come Monday if i am no better she will admit me against my will this time, they are probably as fed up with it as i am.
I am frustrated i can't express totally how i feel the words are stuck inside me.
My partner is frustrated, there is no one where i live who specializes in personality disorders my therapist supports me but thats all he can do, is it really that if you have BPD you are unhelpable?
I don't think i can stay stuck like this forever.
