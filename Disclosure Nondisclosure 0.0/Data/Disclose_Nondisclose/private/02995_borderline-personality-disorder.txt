I'm 17 years old, and since I've been 10 years old i've been feeling on/off feelings of depression. I have been diagnosed with Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder a couple years ago, but i've known i had a sleeping disorder for many years before that. Maybe it's caused by the lack of sleep, but i know i have Seasonal Affective Disorder, although i've never been officially diagnosed because i have never seen a psychologist. For a couple of years, i have been blaming everything wrong with me psychologically and emotionally on the extreme lack of sleep and SAD, put recently i've come across the definition and symptoms of BPD, and i feel like it corresponds to what i've been experiencing for the last 4-5 years at least. The reason i am hesitant to see a psychologist is because:
1- i don't open up easily, as i have lived some traumatic events i don't wish to speak about, even to a shrink
2- i live in quebec, where it takes months to have appointments with child psychologists; the waiting time is shorter with an adult psychologist, but you absolutely need to be 18 to have an appointment
3- i have tried speaking to my regular doctor and parents, but no one takes me seriously because i manage what i live and feel very well, i keep it all inside so that it doesn't show on the outside
4- an official diagnosis would mean that the problem is real, and i dont think i'm ready to fully acknowledge it
So my question is: what should i do? is it possible to have all three disorders ( DSPD, SAD AND BPD) and are they somewhat related? could one cause the other?
