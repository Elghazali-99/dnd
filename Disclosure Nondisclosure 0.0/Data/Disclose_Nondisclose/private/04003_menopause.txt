Complicated& annoying to my drs
 by iatrofears, Oct 06, 2014
Hi I come here to ask a few questions. I have too many issues& fears regarding 
medical procedures& my situation. I'm just going to list them then ask my questions 
Hope thats ok-thanks in advance. 
 1. Vaginismus 
2.possible vulvodynia( dr can't get in good enough to check 
due to the vaginismus). 
3.postmenopausal 2 yrs-had one incident of spotting-maybe size of 2quarters on 
first day then 1-2 spots the next 2-3 days. That was 2weeks  ago-nothing since. 
 4. In addition to vaginismus I have phobia of med procedures including anesthesia as well. 
My dr has kindly offered & went out of her way to offer epidural, twilight sedation(Versed, Propofol), 
Gen Anesth, and whatever local anesthetics i'm sure( but she didn't specify) and Botox. Of course not all these 
at the same time. 
 My questions are: 
1. Anyone here with vaginismus ever experience exam under anesthesia? 
2. Abd ultrasound showed lining is 5mm- is that good or bad? 
 Thanks again
