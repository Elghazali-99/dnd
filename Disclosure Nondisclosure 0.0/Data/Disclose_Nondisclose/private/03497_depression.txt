I don't usually post to much here, but today I'm just not feeling it. It seems like for every two steps I go forward I get pushed ten steps back! I've been searching for months for a home. I finally find one everything is going smoothly. I meet the landlord Shes a delight very nice&helpful eager to help! Beautiful house nice big yard. Everything is going in order the way it should boom boom boom,WALL! Man o man. I moved in with my father those months ago,so used a storage wasnt able to keep up with the payments so what little bit I did have is gone as of Right Now Today!!! So of course I'm upset about that. You know my family pictures,clothes,tvs old prom dresses ive had for 17 years. A lock box I recently purchased&am hoping I have nothing important in. my kids bunk beds even  though they have another set. & the day just keeps getting worse. Im supposed to be going out today but I just wanna sit here & cry my eyes out.. Im going back into a deep depression ready to give up and say forget it all feels like all my effort is never worth it.
