Ok so here is the latest we went to san diego sat with the the family an everything was fine up until my wife was waiting in line an I said I was going to take the kids out cuz it was crowded as I was leaving I seen her go for her phone I gave her a minute an went back in an looked over her shoulder an behold she was freaking texting the other guy about her day mind you she was doing it last weekend to when we were on familiy time. I was hurt very badly an still am he's the thing thing have been going pretty good so far minus this crap . She insist its just flirting but if that's the case sooner or later if she keeps going on like this somethings going to happen I explained how hurt I was she says she wants to try n work things out yet all I've been asking is she stop interracting with this guy. Yet she can't I even told this was her chance if she wanted to be with him an not me ill stop trying . Yet she says she wants to try so I told her what she is doing is not helping us in any way its hurt us an she needs to cut contact with this guy.an she started to cry so she has feeling for him. I just don't know what to do my feelings are getting stronger while I feel she is in idle mode. I feel like walking away but we have so much invested yet I can't keep on taking this. Never knowing what going on if she is just giving. Me lip service or what. She said last night that if I was doing this to her she would have left already is that what I should do I really feel that if she stops this crap we can fixs thing I just can't stop fighting for our marriage . This crap is killing me inside. She says she has told him after sat that she needs to work on us or so she says. But when she leave the house all I can think about is if she is going to go hang out with this guy. Can't stop my head helpneed more advice thanks
