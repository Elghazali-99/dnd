I'm a 27 year old male.  I've had a swollen lymph node on the left side of my neck that has stayed the same size since I was 16.  My doctor doesn't seem too concerned about it.  In the past year I have been able to "crack" my neck in this general area which is starting to worry me.  On the other side of my neck I noticed a smaller swollen node about two years ago.  I saw my doctor about this one and she still didn't seem too concerned about it.  She told me the only reason I noticed it is because I'm skinny.  Other symptoms I've had are itchy ears on a daily basis.  I've been getting bouts of dizziness while driving at night for the past few months.  I've been having extremely vivid dreams where I wake up sweating about once a week for the past few weeks, and I had what a dermatologist called pityriosis roscea(skin rash) about a month ago.
With the swollen lymph nodes in my neck I used to worry about cancer a lot.  I've had two uncles diagnosed with Lymphoma.  Since I didn't develop any other symptoms for years I stopped worrying; however, recently the night sweats and dizziness have started to make me worry again.
I don't really know what question to ask about this.  Does anyone else have permanently enlarged lymph nodes? Should I be worried?  Thank you in advance for any feedback.
