Firstly if I'm going about posting this the wrong way I'm really sorry I'm new and a bit confused by this site. I'm 19 and was first diagnosed with depression when I was 16 it was believed it was my job that caused it and so I took myself off medication when I left. However I gradually began to feel worse and worse until the point I am at now and so I am back on medication. As I said I feel I am at my worst right now I never want to leave the house or bother getting dressed I have no motivation to do anything and am always ill. I am constantly upset by my paranoia and stopped trusting everyone around me as I believed they werent really my friends or I just felt like a burden to the others. Eventually I've managed to push anyone close to me away by ignoring them and I no longer have anyone to talk to I need support from somewhere though any advice? What should I do about the friends I once had none of them ever seemed to understand but I cant tell wether that was just in my mind.
