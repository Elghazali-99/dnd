Hi, this is the first time I posted anything but here it goes.  I have 2 daughters one is 13 and the other is 11 we live with my boyfriend and he has 2 sons one is 16 and the other is 11.  Last year my daughter came to me & told me that my boyfriends son had been touching her inappropriately, so we ask him & he said no that he didn’t touch her.  We talked to him & we didn’t let him back over for awhile.  Well recently he moved in with us.  The 1st few weeks was fine but then my daughter had a friend over & my daughter said that he touched her again but she didn’t tell me.  She went to her fathers  for the weekend & told his girlfriend what had happen.  They called the cops and a report was taken.  But in the mean time I don’t know what to do?  I’m lost on what to do.  I care for my boyfriends son like he was my own but I have to protected my daughter!! I’m just waiting since the cops were involved to hear from the detectives & I also know that children services was called so I just waiting on them to contact us.
 What should I do????
