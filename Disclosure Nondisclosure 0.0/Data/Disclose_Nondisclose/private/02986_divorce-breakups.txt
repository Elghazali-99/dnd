Hello All,
 I am an African-American educated woman; I have a career but have not been so smart in the area of relationships in the past. Long story short, I am in a contested high-conflict custody battleMy ex has done everything to break my relationship with my young child. Child is in counseling.  I tell the judge these things, with evidence; I tell lawyers, and the counselor. They ALL minimize my ex's behavior. I feel voiceless, invisible, and helpless. I am beginning to believe that many people over look my concerns because I am African-American woman. I am not saying that other races of women do not deal with these things, but I feel that subconsciously, people just do not listen to brown women. I am not trying to play the race card at all, believe me, but that is the only explanation I have.   These  professionals  are minimizing his terrible behavior. My question is: Do women of other races experience or have experienced anything like I am experiencing? Do you all think it could be a race thing?
