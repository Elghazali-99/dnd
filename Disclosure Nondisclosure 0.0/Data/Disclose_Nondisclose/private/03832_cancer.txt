The mom was having terrible migraines and went to eye doctor and they gave her bifocals. She would throwup and have excruciating headaches. She went to the hospital because it was just terrible wrenching pain. They examined and so forth found cancer wrapped around her optic nerve from her lungs. I believe her mom died within 6 months. the dad died about 3 years later of colon cancer.  I at least wanted her to get this medical journal and forum started for easy access.  Anyway, she thinks she has mouth cancer and wont let me see it and she decribes it being located in her soft pallette, and afraid she is about to die. She describes it as not perfectly round ,not perfectly smooth, dime sized, looks like a brownish red bruise, it has been there for about 2 years and recently gotten bigger area. About 2 1/2 years ago she got dentures , but wont wear bottom and still in the temporaries she says it is right behind wear dentures in top soft pallette. Also she has broken sharp bone that pops through skinon nose.. Since her dad had to go have those shards of bone removed from his nose whe she was preteen. Could these be related? What u think?
