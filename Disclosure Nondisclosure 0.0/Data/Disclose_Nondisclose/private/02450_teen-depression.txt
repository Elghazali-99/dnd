I am a 19 year old girl, in college, it's obvious stress is going to be a big part of my life. But, I have been going through some relationship problems concerning my boyfriend and his ex, something I cannot control and I'm trying my best to just let it go. But on top of that, I'm dealing with school and getting ready for finals. I have been isolating myself from my family and just about everyone, I go to school, come home and just go to my room and do absolutely nothing. I mentioned to my mom that I do want to see a doctor for this because I truly feel like I am depressed but she doesn't support it at all because she thinks if I go see a psychologist, everyone will look at me differently and since I still live under roof, I have to follow what she says and since she is the bill payer and insurance payer, I don't want to go against her word and just go see a doctor anyway. I don't know what to do, I feel like no one can help me and I don't know what to do about the relationship deal. I need help :\
