So I believe I've suffered from some bipolar or other related disorder since early childhood. I remember wishing I were dead when I was about nine or ten. 
 From age 8 and up I'd just set on a rock on my hill and thoughts would practically hammer in my head. Like why should I even bother who cares you're not worth anything anyways. 
 I always have and probably will always have suicidal impulses I always have the urge to jump off cliffs or out of a speeding car. Wonder how long it'd take to drown. Consider overdose. Death by shotgun. I pretty much have sat and thought up how many ways I could die. 
 I can't have a social life. Because I can't get those ******* thoughts about how I'm not good enough to go away. 
 I think I hear people talking outside my window when I'm trying to sleep and everytime I close my eyes and just about fall asleep I see this oustandingly horrifying monster watching me. Wakes me dead up I tell you what.
 Then sometimes I get to where I sleep up to 16 hours a day and am still tired. I believe ive had two major depressions in my life between 12 and 15.  
I've struggled on and off with cutting sinse 6th grade.
 I know half of the stuff I do and think is senseless. There's no need for it, but I just can't stop! I've tried my Mother just keeps telling me I need to snap out of it but I can't.
 These aren't even all of my symptoms but there's just not enough room for that.
 Sorry this is so damned long. 
What do you think.
