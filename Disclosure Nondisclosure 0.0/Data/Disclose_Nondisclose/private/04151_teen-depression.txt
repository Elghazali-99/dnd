Ok, my names Cassidy. I'm 13 years old. And I'm pretty sure I'm depressed. I've taken a dozen depression tests online and they all say high or very high. Anyway, I need help. I've been in my new school since the begging of the year and I still seem alone. I do have a friend I hang out with at school and another group of girls in my class that are really nice but I just don't seem like I fit in. At times it seems like everyone hates me or I don't even exist. I've lost interest in things I used to love and usually just go on teen chat rooms and try to find someone similar to me. I never do though. I really hate people ( not because everyone is rude it's because I'm extremely shy and quiet. I honestly will tear up whenever I'm walking down the street and someone passes me. ) and I hate seeing people I know from school outside of school. Most  people just ignore me but others will be so happy to see me then we go to school and don't even care. Whenever I'm out in public somewhere I will just put my hood up and hope nobody notices me. I know a lot of you will say this is hormones or something like that but it feels more serious than that. I honestly didn't even want to post this because I know people have way bigger issues than me and mines nothing but I didn't want to keep it to myself anymore. That's also the reason I have not cut. Because people have better reasons than me and then I feel selfish or whatever. Just please help....
