My wife and I have been dating for a number of years with a few breakups in between while we were younger.  During our last breakup and prior to us getting married she dated anther guy and had relations with him.  I had asked to see if she had sex/slept with this guy because it was important for me to know before committing to her in a marriage.  She denied having relations with him and when I continued to press her she stated that he raped her.  With the feeling that I had been misled/lied to our marriage suffered greatly.  To make a long story short, we have been married for 20 years and just 10 months ago she finally told me that she did have a one night stand with that guy before we got married.  We now have 4 beautiful children and she simply says "the past is the past" and stated that I should have left her if I doubted her years ago.  She told me that she did not think we would get back together and was afraid to lose me if she told me the truth....FYI, she was my first and while we were broken up I did have other women who wanted to have sex with me but did not because I still loved her.  I felt that if I did anything with another women then my chances of getting her back was gone.  I feel betrayed by her and question the kind of person I married after knowing the truth.  If our marriage was based on a lie then what else has she been lying to be about for all these years.  If the past is the past then why lie about it to keep someone... that is selfish and cruel in itself.  I understand that this happened while we were apart and not married but it feels wrong non the less.      She tells me now that if I cannot accept her past then I can leave and even stated that she had every right to f--k the guy... my kids are 19, 13, 5 and 4... I am stuck between a rock and a hard plate because I cannot put my children through a divorce...  Indeed she had the right f--k the guy but did she have to right to lie in order to keep me.
