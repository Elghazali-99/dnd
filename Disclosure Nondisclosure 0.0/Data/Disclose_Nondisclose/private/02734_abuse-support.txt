For about 7 years now i have been taking 2 gravol to sleep at nights, actually for the last half year i have cut it back to 1 and a half gravol. I need some help curbing this. I plan to only take 1 tonight for about 6 months then one take half of one and eventually stop. I cannot sleep :( i have major panic attacks about sleeping if i think about what tonight will bring, i lay in bed wide awake until the morning usually in tears because i just cannot sleep. Its terrible, by morning my throat hurts my eyes are dry i cannot function and then when night falls i do it all over again. 
 I avoid caffiene past 12 noon,
I practice yoga
I exercise
 I just cant sleep without an aid. I have tried melatonin which i like, i usually take half a small capsule right beofre bed. 
 I jjust got all my blood tests back and was checked out by my doc and everything came back 100% normal, i need some advice on how to quit the gravol and get a good nights sleep. However i do like my plan of cutting back rather then cold turkey,
 I am a non smoker, a non drinker , and the only drugs i use are gravol.
