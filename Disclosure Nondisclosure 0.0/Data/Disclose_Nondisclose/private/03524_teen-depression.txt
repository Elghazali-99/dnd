Hi, I just wanted a little help here. I'm a 13 y/o girl and have been... Less active lately. I'm not a social butterfly or anything; in fact I think I'm a bit of an introvert. I only have two or three friends who are like sisters, but I haven't been that eager to go out with them or spend time with them lately. I've noticed I've been getting more and more introverted and less eager to get out and do things. I even made up a lie so that they wouldn't come over. I know that's bad, but I wasn't sure if I could handle them because of my lousy attitude. I've also been noticing that my feelings are becoming more negative and my smiles and laughs are more forced than natural. My parents don't really notice anything because I hide out in my room most of the time, but I sometimes snap and become angry at them for the littlest things. 
 This past month, things have been getting harder for me. I found out that my friend has to get sugery for something that is blocking her spinal fluid and giving her pain. Then this guy's, who's a little like a brother to me, older brother died and it made my feelings even darker seeing him act like everything was fine. I keep thinking of dark things and wondering what would happen if I died. I'm not thinking if dying or killing myself, just what would happen if I suddenly didn't wake up. Thought I do sometimes find my recently grown out fingernail scratching myself unconsciously. I'm not sure what to do about this. I'm pretty sure I have depression, but I'm afraid to tell anybody because I think they'll freak out and treat me like I'm made of glass or something. 
 I sorry if it sounded like ranting, but I really needed to get some of this out. Can someone help me please?
