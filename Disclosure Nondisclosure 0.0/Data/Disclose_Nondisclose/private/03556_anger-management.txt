I am always getting yelled at by my spouse and he will call me a b*tch. It got worse when i delivered his baby 1 year ago.he shouted and slammed the door all the time. Newborn jerked and got scared. I tried telling him tht its not ok and he just blamed it on me saying that i made him do tht. He also used his hands and pushed me down during pregnancy and during arguments after i delivered. I even bleed after a fall. I explained tht i have weak bones and am in pain after delivery, and he should be controlling his temper and not push me down. He did acknowledge tht its his fault and did it again anyway. We just argued, he was angy tht i used too much wet tissue to clean baby's poo. He yelled at the baby too because baby was crying. He also told my baby tht im a b*tch. Other days when were not arguing he would be very sweet towards me  and helped with house chores. Im lost and confused and i cry all the time . I have to pull myself up as i have an infant who depends on me. I am aware tht im a victim of domestic violence of an abusive husband. We have gone through marital counselling but it didbt help..he just broke his promise tht he will provide a safe and secure enviroment for his family. I would want my son to grow up with his biological father. I hope my husband will change..will he ever...?
