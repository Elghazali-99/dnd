My friend's wife (call her Z) has always been a hot tempered person, every day of the 10 years of his arranged marriage, which occurred the day she arrived on the plane. She comes from a family of similar nature, fwiw, and they believe it is some genetic trait. Her aunt told her last week that she must get help or she will die (her uncle died during an angry outburst.) Aunt said she got help from meds to help her stop being angry all the time, otherwise death was imminent for her too. 
Z is facing possible perjury charges after a court hearing in a few months because she initially lied and said her hubby assaulted her, but later recanted. She has been under lots of family pressure to rectify her original statement so recanted as I said.
Z and hubby went to the doc on Friday and stated how upset she was with life and doc wrote a script for Celexa 20s. 2 days later Z claims Celexa gave her the miracle cure - no headaches, loves to get up in the morning and eat a big meal, not angry with the kids or hubby at all. She has been taking 10s all week per doc's orders to allow her body to get accustomed before going to what is a normal starter dose of 20s. Ever since the "cure" hit her, Z has been feeling great. I told hubby she is experiencing placebo effect since it is both too early and too little drug to get any benefit.
Z doesn't speak English and is illiterate in her own language so doesn't have much background to draw from. Hubby interprets for her to the doctor, fwiw. Does anyone think Celexa could be helping or is it placebo as I told him? I told him when he updates doc to ask that she stay on 10s for a while to see if her happy change lasts.
