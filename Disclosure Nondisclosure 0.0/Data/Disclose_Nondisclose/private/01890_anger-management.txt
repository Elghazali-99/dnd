Hello im 17 yrs old and I need help controlling my anger. Im not a violent person, but sometimes when I get angry " enough " I want to hit ther person who ticked me off. I do not really mean to hit them, but i REALLY feel the urge to. But most the time I just say what ever comes to my mind at that second verses shutting up and keeping to myself. Little things tick me off though ( im currently on depo and im seeking to change that since, depo has changed my mood so I feel like this, and I do not want this. ) I have a boyfriend of going on 3 1/2 years, and my mood swings over the littlest things are slowly ruining our relationship, Hes told me he misses how i use to be so calm and relaxed..it would take so much to get to me... I miss this side of me too :/ hense why im getting off depo. My relationship with my mother has ben deteriating due to the fact im so, " angry " :( and i want to fix it. For the time being for depo getting clearly 100% out of my system, Can anyone please tell me how to control this anger, I do not know how to properly control? I feel weird.. uncomfortable.. and like a " bad " person because I can not control myself, at what I say.. or do :(
