I have a 20 year old son.  when he turned 18 he thought he owned the world.  Didnt' need school etc.  He did eventually graduate, by the skin of his teeth.  Since he has been 18 he has been couch surfing.  He has been diagnosed with depression and ADD.  he is not a defiantly angry type child and actually fun to talk to when he is not high.  He had to enter a program because he stole with some friends.  This program held him accountable to **** clean for 6 months and do the homework of the program.  He was one of six that graduated out of 18.  went to court and has to do a 2 year probation and his record is expunged.  Now that he is out of the program i feel he is sliding backward into the **** he was in before, that is crapy friends, no job, laying around the house, no ambition, lots of bull talk.  In the past My wife and I have kicked him out to try to get his *** in gear.  He just doesn't care.  My wife allowed hime to come home to battle this court stuff but now that that is over we don't know how to get him going or what we should do.  He has said he wanted to end his life several times in the past.  He is not on any antidepressant as of now.  He was prescribed the medicine but one of the side effects is suicide thoughts. 
 Any help would be appreciated
