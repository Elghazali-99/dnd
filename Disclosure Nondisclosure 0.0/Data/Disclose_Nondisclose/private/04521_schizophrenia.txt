Does mental illness make ppl fully non religious for lifetime? I am madly deeply in love with non religious theory. Probably because of that i forget the pain. But i don't say anyone to be like me they can do as they like. And i never advise anybody either cause I don't like to be beaten. Hopefully there might be many extreme non religious ppl in the world like me who obviously scare with society. But i was extremely religious before, i used to see horoscope a lot, I used to go to fortune teller again and again. But such a extremely religious person, today just opposite, madly deeply non religious and that is me. I just wanted to know is this happening to all the mental illness ppl or not? And it is sure mental ill ppl are all over the world and it's growing everyday. Does mental illness a method to change the world? Does it make ppl non religious? 70% of secret ppl starts realizing when they know s*x is painful or pleasure reduction. There are so many mental illness people increasing in my country. Few years b4 , i hardly knew handful of people. Hopefully very few will go ivf, So tomorrow is the generation of mental ppls.
