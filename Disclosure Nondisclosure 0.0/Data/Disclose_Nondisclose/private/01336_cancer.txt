I had cervical cancer (2009) . I was over radiated. Since, after slow deteriation, I had to have most of my intestines removed and a colostomy. The doctor (different then my cancer doctors thru er) made it so I could have it reversed. That was suppose to be in August. I have asked "my" doctor to reverse it and his answer was he doesnt know what all was done so no he wouldnt. My question is, Would it be dangerous due to the over-radiation and possible other problems coming up to have it reversed? I cant seem to get a answer that I can understand out of my cancer doctors. When I asked what was gooing to happen next my doctor told me "Actually Im keeping an eye on your kidneys". Well great ty. Im 56 and want the most normal life I can have but wont put myself in more danger but need to know if a reversal would work or hurt my situation. Is it because of possible future over radiation problems? or my doc doesnt want to finish a surgery that another doc started? What? One is a cancer doc, one is a intestinal doc. Dont know who to listen too.
