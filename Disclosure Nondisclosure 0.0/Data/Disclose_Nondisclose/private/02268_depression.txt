Today may have been the worse day of my life mentally. I have anxiety and depression. I`m a 16 year male. I usally just have to worry about anxiety cause i fear of having a heart attack and dying and it`s really ruining my live. But today i think my depression hit me the worse. I was on my computer just fine hanging out then all of a sudden i just started to cry like for no reason. And i`m the last person to cry i hate to cry. But i cried and cried the my mind went numb its hard to explain but i couldnt think like i wasnt happy or sad or nothing my mind was like a blank board. I have had episodes were i felt blank and werid but today was terrible. Even right now typing i just dont feel right if that makes since. Then my anxiety kicked in and i have a big fear of having a heart attack so i stared having these fake symptopms thinking i was having a heart attack but i was so depressed that after a while i didnt even care and actually felt maybe it would be good to die. Sorry this was long but today was terrible i felt bad before but to cry and even wish not to live anymore is bad. I`m too young to be dealing with this. I wake up and dont even want to live life anymore and i came here so hopefully someone can talk and help me. I do feel alone when i tell my parents they laugh and call me retarded and think i`m doing this to be stupid i know my friends would just tease me if i told them what i going through. So if u know what im going through and can help me please comment. I dont want to live like this anymore. Thank you.
