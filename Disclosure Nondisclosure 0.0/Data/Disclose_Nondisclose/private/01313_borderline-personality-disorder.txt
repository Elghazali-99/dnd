I can't bring myself out of feeling completely sad and unloved.  Having just returned from vacation, I need my husband to show marked enthusiasm at my return.  His overall behavior felt distant to me, although he did say he felt sick and had driven 3 hours that day before picking me up at the airport.  I struggled between absolutely hating him and resenting him to wondering why he clearly does not love me anymore.  It hurts me so much more because I know that is the fearful child inside me, but I can't get out of those kinds of thoughts.  I don't want to talk to him at all but then I feel like if there really wasn't a reason having to do with me, now there is, because I'm playing the silent sulker, which he is familiar with.  So I ask him, are you really not feeling well, or genuinely not excited I'm back from vacation?  He stuttered unaudible sounds, and I said immediately to NOT start answering a question like that!  He said I'd put him in an awkward position.  What does that mean?  He had an affair while I was gone?  He started drinking again?  I know those are such anxiety-ridden fears, but he knows me, so why can't he assure me that he still loves me as much as ever?  I can't stop crying.  I have missed him and want to know that he missed me.  He does not seem to care.  How much of my feelings are projections and how much may be authentic?  I can't figure myself out!
