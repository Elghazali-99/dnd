I seriously need some help figuring things out. Lately I feel so heavy, like mentally my mind feels like its tired and weary. I feel so sad when im by myself , like im always pitying myself and then I get angry and annoyed at myself for feeling sorry for myself because I have no reason to be. I have a nice family and friends so I dont know why I feel like this. Others have noticed me getting mad very quickly lately but dont notice that im upset a lot. 
 Thing is although im not motivated to do things like get up and get showered or clean up etc, I can still motivate myself to go to parties and around certain people I can feel normal and happy.. my social life hasnt suffered yet which makes me think that its all in my head and maybe im just feeling this way for attention?  
 Only a few nights ago I got so frustrated and angry that I cut my wrists .. but not to kill myself I just wanted to let put this built up anger. 
 Im so confused someone please help me figure out whats going on with me .. why can't I feel like the other girls
