Well, ever seens or maybe before i left to my overseas school project , i had bad constipation and it could be frm e food although or controlling too much, but it gotten worsen when i came back i was full of bloated stomach and weird hungry feeling and sounds, i didnt bother much afterall, i had stomach pains and always had frequent bowel movement, and i just had twice diarrhea in school, i notice my first loose bowel had little red spots as i thought it could be cause by my tomatoes feast. I eat tomatoes Salca with rice mostly all time when i am hungry, ok and that doesnt matter, and e loose stool turned back to normal , i just have bloaty gassy kinda feeling in my stomach or somehow hungry or whatsoever feeling, i thought of going to see a doc but it gets little better. Today, i went to the toilet and did my business, i saw dark red with small streaky pink thing and now worrying i have colon cancer. i kept telling myself i might just have ate too much tomatoes. i just don't wanna see a doc and end out with bad results.. i am just worried. i just hope that answers could just tell me its e stupid undigested tomato.. thanks :(
