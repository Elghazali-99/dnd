so my girlfriend has been saying she thinks she has schizophrenia...she does have bad anxiety. she found out that her grandmother had it, and that they gave her shock therapy for it. she doesn't know if her mom has it, but her mom received the shock therapy to, supposedly for bad depression. my girlfriend is 18 years old. and has been reading up on schizophrenia and as someone with anxiety gets, she got nervous about it. I asked her why she thought that, aside from genetics, and she said because she is paranoid all the time. so I have been doing a little research but it is hard to tell if the symptoms described with schizophrenia meet her symptoms. the only things I can think of that might be somewhat symptoms are...on about 2 separate occasions,when she and I were arguing she will laugh out of no were, but this could just be because I said something funny or made a face that was funny during the argument. she does get very frustrated sometimes and blows up on me out of nowhere. mainly during things like driving in heavy traffic, and she makes a wrong turn and gets frustrated. sometimes during arguments she likes to turn my words around. she has never said anything about hearing voices or seeing something that isn't there. and she doesn't seem to be confused about much of anything, she is actually very smart. she goes to school and is making good grades. she has a job and works very hard. she only has a flat face with not that much emotion showing when we are in an argument. she has no problem smiling when she is happy. and crying when she is sad. she does talk about the illuminati a lot and says she thinks her boss is in the illuminati but I got into a conspiracy theory phase abound 18 to. any help would be appreciated. I have high anxiety as well so when she said that it got me thinking about it and just want to know if I am over reacting or if there might be something wrong with her so I can get her some help.
