How do I get my wife the Mental illness help she needs?
We have been married 17 years now.  Our marriage didn't start out too good financial and she lied about her credit card debt and abuse.  Right when we got married I paid off $12,000 of her credit cards.  No problem she was single with 2 small children.  But months later I say credit card bills in the $25,000 range.  She didn't tell me because she knew I won't marry her.  Now 17 years later I can't get a loan, we have 5 children 23, 19, 16, 15, and 13.  She keeps spending money and will not look at a budget.  We have been to counciling (financial and marriage) for the last 13 years.  The last one told us to get devorced.  But I can't take the chance the kids will be given to her.  I and the councilers think she is bi-polar.  There has been abuse in the past but with the counciling I have been through I am in control at the moment.  What she does is verbal and emotional abuse infront of the kids.  She has tantrum if she doesn't get her way.  They are endless and leaving doesn't help because when I come back it starts up again.  Social workers will not help me because I'm a man and they only seem to care about women.  What should I do.  This story is only a very small fraction of what has happened.  I can't talk to her because if the logic goes against her she changes the subject and starts on something completely different.  She did this to the last counciler and he gave up.  When she gets depressed she spends money.  She was taking medication at one time and it helped but her favorite saying is "everyone else has the problem not me".
