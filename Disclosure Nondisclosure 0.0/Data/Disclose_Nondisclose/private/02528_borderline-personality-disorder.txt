I don't think i will evern cope with this rejection thing, been struggling for days, too stubborn to call my therapist because he doesn't know what to do, my partner is stressing me follows me everywhere feel like i have no privacy or freedom, trapped by anxiety and argraphobia want to SH so badly but he hid everything sharp so what now i am going to buy something can't hold the feeling any longer, i know it makes me weak and pathetic not being strong enough to resist been resisting for days now and the tension is still building. My therapist doesn't know what to do but i won't leave him he will never get rid of me, every day i see him i am thinking are you thinking you just wish i would go away and leave you alone, if BPD isn't a mental illness as they say well what the hell is wrong with me is it pretend? Saw the guy who attacked me the other day yuck can't even go there my head is so full of him and how his life goes on, had a nightmare with me as a child made me realize a lot about my past so messed up, I don't know why i am rambling on just frustrated i guess and trying to be sensible before the other me takes over the childish one who will do what she wants regardless of who she hurts, i know that disappearing for hours hurts and scares others but i know i will still do it, why won't they listen without me having to do that.
