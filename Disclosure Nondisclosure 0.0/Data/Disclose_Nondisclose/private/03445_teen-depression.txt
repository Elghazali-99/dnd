I'm a teenage boy, i'm 14. I think i'm depressed but i'm not sure. I stay up almost everynight, then at school i'm sometimes very tired or quite hyper. I feel very sad when i'm alone, i feel quite guilty but i don't know why. Lately this past week i've been listening to songs actually about depression on repeat over and over. I don't have feelings of hurting myself but i do feel worthless sometimes. I want to get help but i feel scared to do so.I asked my friend what he thinks and he says it is all in the mind but i feel like something is really not right. I do smile and have some fun with friends, but they also tend to make me upset alot by making certain reamarks also. I don't want to tell my mother because i feel like it's to much of a hassle and she herself has been stressed lately and  has gone through depression herself i'm not sure if perhaps this has affected me in a way, but i just feel like something is wrong and i don't know who to tell, because my friend didn't really listen and i don't want to just start spamming my friends because then they will think i'm desperate.
