hi, MY HUSBAND HAS RECENTLY GIVEN UP SMOKING AND HAS GREATLY DECREASED HIS ALCOHOL INGESTION DUE TO A HEALTH SCARE.  i THOUGH MOST OF HIS BEHAVIOR WAS FROM THE SUBSTANCES HE WAS USING.  iT HAS BEEN 3 MONTHS SO i THINK ALL THE WITHDRAWS ARE GONE.  HE IS VERY MOODY AND HAS NO TOLERANCE FOR MYSELF OR OUR 4 YEAR OLD SON. IF MY SON MAKE GUN SHOOTING NOISES WHEN HE PLAYS IT REALLY UPSETS HIM.  I HAVE HEARD HIM TALKING TO HIS SELF, FOR EXAMPLE LAst night we were watching a movie and our son was very noisey and we could not watch it. Husband got up and went to the other room. I went to the kitchen and heard him in the hall saying I am so sick of this ****!  I asked him what he was cussing about and he started yelling at me and told me I had no right to ask him what he was talking about because he was talking to himself.  He also gets very anxious almost every saterday and wakes the house up to hurry and go do the chores of the day. It is always groceries or home depot today.  I feel close to him at times but then he starts talking to self or fussing at me about everythin on certain days. He tells me to leave and get out of his house at lest every other week.  He says it is caose.  I tend to try and reason with him and talk to him about his actions and all he sasys is I blame everything on him.  One other big thing going on is we are trying to have a baby for two years. He will some times be very hapPY AND WANT TO DO IT then turn around and say it is consuming our lives and he is not going to do it any more. These mood changes I never know what the day will bring.  He also has said several times he thinks he has 2 personalities but does not want to hear about getting help. I think if this is true do I really want to bring another baby here who could have this same disorder.  Do you think he has a true mental illness or is it just the stress of life.
