When I was young, from about 10 to 13, my oldest brother who is 4 years older than me use to sexually abuse me.  It affected me emotionally growing up.  It made me become very quiet and shy and kept to myself. When I begged him to stop or would refuse to do something sexual, he would hit or threaten me. I never told my parents for the sake that he was my brother. I knew it wasn't okay but I didn't want to get him in trouble plus he threatened me not to tell. I always thought I would have the nerve to tell me best friend growing up but I could never do it. I never told anyone and I wasn't sure if I ever would. When we were around my other family or other people we acted completely normal towards each other like there were no problems.  I never wanted to be alone at home with him.  I was very scared of him yet I loved him because he was my brother.  I also have another brother and because of this, I was never close to either one of them.  A couple months ago, he died in an automobile accident. It was definitely a tradegy, but now I can't stop thinking about what happened when we were younger. Since he is now gone, I would really like to tell my mother or talk to somebody and get some help. I know it is  going to be very hard to talk about after all these years especially after a death. I am also kind of afraid my parents wont be understanding and might get mad at me since he has now passed and make me feel guily since they can't hear his story or maybe even not believe me.. please help
