I have had a diagnosis of schizo-affective disorder for around 12 years although 2 years ago they added Borderline Personality Disorder to this so I now have a dual diagnosis. I can experince dellusion symptoms and psychotic symptoms with extremities of mood swings. It was the same psych that diagnosed me with both. I can see where B.P.D comes into it through my self harming, black and white thinking/feeling, problems with eating and various suicide attempts. The problem is I've read that you should not be diagnosed with B.P.D if you have another psychiatric illness. Could someone let me know if that is the case.
Also, I now have a new psychiatrist who hasn't even read my case history notes and has never met me on an individual basis although he believes I should steer clear of medications. Not all meds but he is reluctant to prescribe things that helped before I started seeing him like benzodiazepines, mood-stablizers, anti-psychotics and I believe that to be due to my most recent health dificulties being symptoms of B.P.D. So, I'm kind of thinking he may not believe in this dual diagnosis but unlike my old psych he refuses to review me individually and will only see me at team meetings where I often don't say what is really going on in my head.
I'm sorry if this is confusing to read but what I'm trying to say is dificult to put into words. I'd be really grateful though if anyone has any advice.
Thanks x
