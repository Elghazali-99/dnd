Hi ladies....these are not classic hot flashes, so I'm not sure what's going on with me, but thought I'd run it by you.
 I've a lot of posts in the heart rhythm and heart disease communities recently because of some of the symptoms, but it's possible it's all peri-menopause....just not sure at this stage.  The doctor is running a few more tests but is not too concerned.
 Basically I'm getting episodes of facial flushing, with feelings of hunger, more than i'm used to, then skipping heart beats which are calmed by eating up to a point, and a 'wooshing' kind of sensation in my upper body.  I suppose it is a like a heat feeling rising up through my upper body, but I wouldn't have described it as heat really, more like an energy.  I don't feel hot or like I need to open windows or anything.  But my face is often burning at these times, so my skin on my face feels hot, but the rest of me is ok.  I just feel like my skin is burning and needs a cold compress on it, lol.
 I'm 46.  My periods have been regular, but last month it was a week late and this seemed to be accompanied by more than usual skipped heartbeats.
 Thanks for your thoughts/experience.
