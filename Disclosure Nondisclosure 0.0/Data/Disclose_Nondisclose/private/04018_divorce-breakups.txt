I dated a girl I will call "M" in an LDR for 3 years. I was single before M so I was flirting with other girls at the time. Eventually I flirted with her and we became a couple. However I was still flirting with women because I wasn't convinced we would work and parents hated M. 
 That changed when I first met M. I stopped talking to other girls and told her about my other flirts. She was a jackpot and a very genuine girl however she felt hurt and felt betrayed despite circumstances. 
 However we made our relationship work and shared many memories and my family accepted her. She visited vacations and LDR wasn't that bad. 
 None of the things that upset me about M was her temper though. When I told her certain guys made me uncomfortable she called me jealous. Yet when I took my friend who was moving away to dinner she blew up.
I was spiteful and started looking up other girls on FB because she was ok with her guy friends yet not ok with my girl friends. She broke up with me three months ago because of this. She couldn't take the "distrust" and "controlling nature of me" anymore. 
 Now she is telling me to be friends and if she feels like I've earned it then she will escalate things. However when I bring up the relationship she tells me it's irritating and annoying and that I need to shut up. She is doing things I wanted to do with her like going to concerts and camping, which upsets me because I feel left out. When I ask about any new romantic interest, she accuses me of seeing other people and that she is not the same as me. She said just to give her space and she will think about us. 
 I don't really want to be her friend and if given the chance I want to make us work. I don't know if being her friend is the best thing or if I should go NC. Honestly I'd be heartbroken to see another guy live my dreams however I dont hate her enough to kick her out of my life. She is a genuine girl and I love her. I really just want to win her back but I don't know what to do.
