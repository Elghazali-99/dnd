I'm currently taking zoloft at a dose of 200mg daily, in the morning. My doctor's instructions were to go all the way up to the maximum dose of zoloft because he believes that my combination of depression, anxiety, PTSD and bulimia might simply be treatment resistant. I've been on zoloft twice before, but never at a dose any higher than 150mg.
 I've been on the 200mg dose of zoloft for five weeks now, and though I had initial side effects they did go away. However, all of the physical side effects such as dry mouth, excessive sweating, nausea, diarrhoea, feeling uncomfortable in my own skin, and crying at the drop of a hat have all come back with a vengance. Typically they ease up by early afternoon, but these side effects are making it very hard for me to function in the morning.
 I really don't know what to do because I can't stand feeling like this, but the medication is helping even out my mood to some extent. Should I persist with the zoloft at this dosage and see if the side effects go away or ask my doctor to taper down? 
 Has anyone experienced anything similar with SSRIs? How did you deal with it?
