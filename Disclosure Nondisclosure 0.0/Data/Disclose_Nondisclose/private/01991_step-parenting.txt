I have a 15 year old step son who has been trying to separate his dad from me.  A little over three years ago my husband and I met at that time and he had 100% custody of his son who lived with him. I had a 6 year old son, who is now night. My stepson would purposely ignore my son whenever he tried to talk to him and complain that I had to play with him when we shared our time together.  Needless to say his son played an instrumental part in our break up so long ago. After a short hiatus my husband contacted me to reconnect. We got back together immediately. At that time he them no longer had his son living with him, he chose to live with his mother because of the school that he wanted to attend. Once we moved in together he started to see his son more often, he would come over every weekend. Not long after the move in his mother started contacting me to let me know of concerns her son has been telling her, which she did not believe were true because she knew who I was. We both feel he is playing both side of families against eachother as she has a husband who he disrespects also.  Since then my stepson has been nothing short of make it unbelievably impossible for us to get along no matter what I do or say. It has come to the point now where he has given his father an ultimatum stating that if he didn't leave me and get his own place you would never see him again. I don't know what to do, any advice.
