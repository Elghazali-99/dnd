I need your advice,I'm desperate and very embarrassed!Can anyone out there please help me!!Well here goes my crazy rave that is so very distressing to me......a combination of a court case involving slander and privacy breaches,being stalked,a 12year relationship with a controlling,manipulative man who I have just realized sabotages and puts me down as he was jealous of me and who had an affair with a woman who unknown to me harbored intense jealousy towards me,who I basically financially supported both of them without credit and had to beg my husband for any money,the people at work thinking he is the nice guy and I'm the ***** cause i make them turn up for work and don't give away our money to be nice to them...husband also flirts with the  attractive woman in front of me and they act lie they may have their meal ticket in him,the death of a child as she wasn't my husbands he told me to get over it a few days later..........All over many years continuously without a break I felt my defenses wearing down,my personality being stripped away from me,the loss of all my self respect,from being very confident to Zero confidence that is very evident to people I meet or have known prior........my husband took my place and would control all I did in the beginning even took my goals and dreams as his and discounted me ,I felt like a border in our home like nothing was mine.....when finding out about the affair I was so devastated and shocked....and also realized this other woman had been so jealous and had just lost her husband and had no life,she had coldly calculated taking my guy and my position..she began to resemble me,do everything I did,bought the same car nd went out to the places i would go,even had surgery to look like me......I was so shocked that a person could think like this and I realized my guy had been bad mouthing me with her and abusing me emotionally and physically due to her manipulations,his opinion of me changed since her very subtlety he didn't respect me and was walking around like some king since I found out about her as I was weak emotionally and he got stuck into me with the undermining and put downs..he d scream if i opened windows or would go anywhere...I got sick through lack of sunlight........I was hanging in or coping till the woman and the shock she deliberately did this and the deceit turned me into a bliverig mess this was 2years ago and now I'm to frightened to walk outside as I panic and cry....he tell me this wasnt done right or I cant wash up.....so I stopped functioning at home as i couldn't take it anymore...slowly he s cut me off from everyone and i have noone.......he denied sex from me for nearly 5years with excuses and he would do it so I felt disgusting and rejected.......since the affair he s really got stuck into me with im crazy and need help....I did act out as I couldn't deal with the woman who is still here everyday and i  sent her a texts making myself out to be crazy...why I don't know...the rage inside me that she deliberately did this turned onto myself and I decided to hurt myself instead of her as I'd be bashed or everything taken from me by him if I even confronted her....It drove me eventually insane the fact she see s him everyday...he says she normal and I'm insane....I wondered what he saw in her and it could only be that she is very needy and not as strong as me,for some reason I acted as pathetic and needy as her to try and reality test if he would give me affection if I was as pathetic and needy as her.......I got lost in acting pathetic and needy and dependent on him and now Ive become the small minded,incapable,unattractive,infantile idiot they had told me for so long,through all the negative self talk fueled by my rage....only 2years ago I was still attractive and youthful looking enough to do some modeling still...her calling me the ugly as a nickname to him and to my face.....I've either made myself unattractive or have become it through all this and fear i wont bounce back.............my inward rage seems to block me from even having any nice thoughts or memories of who i was.....I cant remember whole chunks of my life or who I was............Now you've read this and gone ...MY GOD or WOW!!!she s a loony or an complete idiot!!.......please it wasn't long ago I was a strong,bright attractive woman who was always liked and very respected by my friends ,community and colleagues......I'm torchered I have no life and sit st home a mess with him reinforcing it and discussing me with her(the OW)..........when i brought up my daughter to her and him at xmas 2years ago...she said your dwelling on it for attention and he said its been two years get over it!!......so I dwell led give them dwell!!!I have for 2years and given him hell about her!!
Please if I read this I'd shake my head.....I am not a woman without class or substance but have been acting it and its all very foreign ....usually I would of said they deserve each other and left him...but a combination of circumstances and abuse that I allowed to happen as I was confused had led me to this behaviour!
I cant leave him just right now for practical raesons and find it hard living with him daily...he till denys the affair!
I was intelligent once and cannot even understand a simple movie...I mean not just unable to concentrate...cant understand it..like I've become the idiot they keep telling me I am!!
I felt I had nothing left to give while he was living my dreams through my hard work...and so was she and even taken on my identity or persona while dumping their inadequacies on me until Ive become thos stranger and this repulsive person!!
Have I become or am I really this [erson?
Have I finally gone insane?I'm losing contact with some reality obviously!!
Am I able to be again and if so how do I recover?How do I get rid of this rage thas become my life and so much so I don't even bother cooking for myself or washing(due to his criticizing originally..then everyone saying I'm lazy or a pig)People I meet don't wont to know me..when I was so bubbly and liable........I feel i cant leave him even if I could right now cause im useless.........and disgusting...I have no self respect left!
 Please take this seriously I'm in agony and have tried councilpersons in fact several that just wanted to talk about them or put me on drugs......
I need understanding and a cuddle from a friend,support encouragement I'm sure...but i dont have that and I'm not going to get it in my state........I want to recover but thoughts of her engulf me daily as the rage is never ending and turns into seeeelf destruct..I act out and deliberately make myself look like what they have told me and manipulated and deceived me into believing...how can i recover,ive tried to get help but doesnt look like their sis the help they say there is out there!
If you read this...thank you......thank you!!!I need advice please to help me end this misary..is this normal at all??
