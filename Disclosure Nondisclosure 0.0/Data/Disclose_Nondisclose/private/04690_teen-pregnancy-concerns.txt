I'm around 3-5 days late for my period. I've had it for about 5 years now so i have a pretty accurate idea on when i start. Me and my bf were rubbing genitals(no penetration of any kind, ejaculation, or anything) for less than 20 seconds and now that my period is late, he thinks I may be pregnant. What are the odds that I am? I was told you can't get pregnant unless theres ejaculation or sex involved. And is there anything i can do to trigger my period? I haven't been worrying about this too much so I didn't exoect a delay like this. I have no one to talk to, which is why i came here. I can't ask for anything from family or parents without rinking my bf going to a juvenile center, which is obviously the last thing i need. Please help me....I really need it. I also had a tampon in tkday just in case i did start and when I took it put, there was a line going down it made of, what seemed to be, a yellow ringed discharge which is something i usually get right before I start. Not to mention, I've had the uncomfortable feeling i get when im on my period twice but nothing has happened.I've tried hot showers, warm blankets, and even taking at least 1000 mg of calcium with no rose hips ir anything for the oast few days...someone help me please....im so scared
