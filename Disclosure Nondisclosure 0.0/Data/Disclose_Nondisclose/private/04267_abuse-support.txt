I have been with my boyfriend for almost a year. He has two children and i have two children. Ever since our relationship started he always had these days where he would withdraw. He is a very nice person and so loving and affectionate and sweet but then anything can change his mood. He is almost like bipolar, it's hard to deal with. I always fall into the victim role and try to do anything to make him feel better. Anything can make him angry and he always takes it out on me. Its hard because of my kids, my kids also annoy him at times and it's like i walk on egg shells so they won't upset him. It's so difficult because even when he is mean he goes through times where he is so loving and caring and me helps my daughter with her homework and at times he is loving to them too. My little girl really likes him. I just don't know what to do.. i try ignoring him and wait till he gets over it because he usually does. But it's a hard life.. I am a pretty girl and am such a giver i do everything for him. I just feel like a push over.
