Seriously, what [IS] my problem?
Can anyone help me find out please? 
Here's my story. I find myself having rehearsal 
conversations & thoughts. This usually happens
when I'm alone in MY room or when I'm in the shower.
Sometimes it even happens when I'm listening to music
when I find myself whispering to myself, picturing people 
in my head following along with the song as of I were playing
in my own little world a music video in my brain. It's not until I
get stuck repeating a phrase that I realize what I'm doing & I 
that's when I walk away shaking my head telling myself:"I'm weird".
Yet the next day I do it again? And I recently literally sat down and 
wondered and question myself why I talk to myself the way i do? Am I
going crazy? I'm I schizophrenic or something? I don't know when I started
with this weirdness part of me but I know I've been doing it for quite a very long time! I wonder if this is a disorder and if so what is it called? I have thought about a doctor but I obviously don't go cause it's embarrassing. Lol. I don't HEAR voices or believe someones controlling my brain. Lol. [ I ] put and picture things in my head and then I realize what I'm doing and I stop; I just wonder why i do this? I've read some disorders but I haven't found any that completely fits in my category. I hope this doesn't get worse and I'm going to stop this before it does.. I'm so WEIRD!!!!!!!! Lol by the way the topic I put was required so i chose a random one I hope someone can help me with the correct one. Thanks! :)
