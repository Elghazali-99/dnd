Dear doctor,
 My dad is diagnosed with infiltrating transitional cell carcinoma urinary bladder a few days ago. 
 As per the report " The tumor is composed of proliferated ovoid or polygonal cells distributed in groups or solid mass. The cells enclose ovoid hyperchromatic nuclei and fair amounts of light stained cytoplasm. They present moderate anisocytosis. The tumor has infiltrated the muscle layer. Small foci of necrosis are seen. A portion of covering urothelium is seen in one area.
 Conclusion: Infiltrating Transitional Cell Carcinoma Urinary Bladder
Grade: III
Stage: Not less than T2"
 Now I'm very worried about this as me being an engineer have no clue about what the report says about the cancer.
 My main concern is, what stage is the cancer in in terms of a layman language. What should be our action down the road and what possible solutions can we aim to treat this cancer.
 What possible impacts could it have on my dad's general health, being he's a 62 year old diabetic and have some issues with his BP as well.
 I will really appreciate your help if you can please answer my questions above.
 Regards,
 Apoorv
