Hi , Im from Quebec Canada,
 My 2 question are .
 1st ) My Girlfriend is presently very stressed out with life . ( thats what I think ) 
Shes a university student , works at the most famous hotel in montreal, and now shes having a problem with her knee ( She as a kiss ; a lump) The doctor told her she needs to take it off but its 4 weeks remission , so she cant work , or go to school and she will be on crotches. 
 Also , well i would say about 1 month ago shes having trouble with big nauseous problem in the morning also sometimes day time. She took a birth test but negative.
Im really worried for her.
 she cant even go out the house because shes scared of beiing sick at work or school ( its her last year by the way! ) 
and shes feeling very depress because she doesnt feel usefull.
 And in about 3 month from now we will own a new house so theirs alos the money factor.
 Im trying to help her by telling her to go see a doctor to get some blood test but shes like leave me alone , dont bother me , Its weird because she tells me she crazy in love and she cant ask for more but physicial and mentally shes feeling stress and awful.  
 Please tell me what should I do! 
Thanks
