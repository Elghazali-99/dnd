So, yesterday I got a message via ecare from my primary care physician, informing me that she believes that the health problems I am experiencing are due entirely to stress and ritalin.  Now, In fairness, I am under a freaking lot of stress: I'm a full time student, raising a 6 month old child, and living in a two bedroom, one bathroom house with my son and 4 other adults (parents, boyfriend, and another housemate who is my parents' age).  
My symptoms are fatigue, appetite loss, swollen lymph nodes, difficulty with memory and thinking beyond what seems appropriate to my level of fatigue at any given time, widespread mild to moderate pain with no apparent cause,  and left sided headaches which have been growing in frequency.  I also experience occasional (seldom more than once a week) bouts of moderate to severe nausea without any apparent cause.  
I am 18 years old, 5'2", 101lbs and female.  I have trouble meeting nutrition and calorie goals because of never really wanting to eat, but my iron, vitamin D, folate, and b12 are all fine, as is my thyroid.  
My symptoms started about 2 and a half years ago, and have been getting steadily worse since then.  At that point I was not under any particular stress as it was summer break, although I had recently had strep, and gone through most of my finals that quarter with a high fever.  (I was part of a program for high school students to take college classes).  So, does this sound like it's the result of stress, or should I push my doctor to keep looking?
