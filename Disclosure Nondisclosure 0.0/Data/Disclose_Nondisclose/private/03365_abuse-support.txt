I let my kids go to there dads house for the weekend and my oldest daughter (6) called me on Saturday night crying telling me that she wanted to come home. I didn't understand why she lives going to her dads and has never had a problem. He was at work and the kids were home with his mom and step dad. I told her she would be ok and to call me in the morning she started crying even more so I agreed to go get her. When I got there (5minutes) away his mom answered the door and told me that I could not take her and that it was her sons night. I told her that I didn't care and she called me crying saying that she wanted to come home. She was acting wired and would not let me in the house so I started calling for my daughter and I could hear her screaming for me. The mom kept trying to **** the door in my face and I finally pushed past her and went in the house anyways. I found my daughter locked in the bedroom so that she could not come to me and when I opened the door I could see that someone had slapped her across her face you could see the visible handprint. I starte screaming and asking who hit her and both adults denied Anythkng had happened. I took all three if my girls home and waited for there dad to get off work. I'm the mean time my daughter to me it was the step father that hit her because she wasn't listening. I don't know what to do
