I am a recovering anorexic (sometimes) and I am borderline personality disordered.  I was prescribed Aropax CR 25 mid last year.  This year in January my doctor increased dosage to 50mg.  I am hating the fact that the weight gain is so severe, I restrict a lot and skip many meals since my weight went up by 4/5 kgs.  I have been depressed since Nov to now April.  It has gotten severe.  I am numb to every emotion, activity and just feel like an empty entity.  I am more irritable, agitated and hostile towards people.  Strangers are easy targets. 
 I feel I have given time to try lift my mood, stimulate myself but I am not coping.  My head is way below the water.  The issue is not all about my weight but everything.  I have no need to be like this because my life is good and i have great support from my family since I crashed three years ago.
 Why have I gained so much weight?  What is the normal weight gain?  Why would I have done a 360 downfall?  It worked for two months then it feels like my own efforts and the drug does not help.  I feel worse than the last time I was admitted to the hospital.
