My parent are checking on everything I do. I'm 19 years old. I love partying but I also know my limits and I am studying hard. My uni is 5 hours away from home. Yet, my dad is spying on everything that I do and he calls me and threatens me. I'm already having a hard time at uni. I can't mix around with most people. I have a few senior friends who i enjoy hanging out with and they are all guys. I'm a girl btw. But my parents are not happy with this and they're assuming that I sleep with all those guys. I don't know what to do. Because of all that they know, I'm finding it hard to trust anyone here. Everytime my dad sends me this threatening messages and when he calls, i get really depressed. I'm feeling very lonely, I cant trust anyone, and i'm having suicidal thoughts. And on top of that, because of all this problems, i have been getting bad panic attacks and anxiety. I don't know how to deal with my parents when I go home next (which is 2 weeks from now). I just want to avoid them. I love them but somehow I feel like all i have been doing is disappointing them.
