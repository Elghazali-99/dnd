Hi, 
Im 20 years old male, I havent slept today yet, I've been awake for 20 hours already. And i tossed and turned for about 3 hours now, and gave up. I havent been able to sleep for the past 2 weeks. Its been a torture. Again, I'm thinking too much. Im going through everysingle step of emotion during the night. I get angry at my past, I become sad that I dont have love, and then I get anxious about my career. I can't wait to start working, and I can't wait to start making money. Also I think about it alot, at least 70% of my thoughts have to do with work. I only want to eat work. And that includes me not eating. I lost quite a few pounds now, but I dont know any other way to think about food. Just that I have to explain, i've been trying to do a few things to relax my mind. I even searched a whole bunch of things of how to cope with anxiety, and how to sleep well. I've been doing the crunching my feet, my butt, my hands, my eyes, to make me go sleep. At least thats what they said. And yet, I come back with all my thoughts that abuse my mind while i try to sleep. If I could simply be able to sleep, I think I could think clearer. But now I'm too worried about everything. Im angry now! HELP?
