Hi all,
 to keep my problems short and sweet, can anybody diagnose what is up with me!! here's my symptoms:
 Constant worry about my health
Up till 3am/5am each night and waking up between 1pm/3pm
Can't concentrate and thick headed
Constant worry about heart attacks/strokes
From being skinny to having a beer belly, makes it hard to fully breathe at times when i sleep
anxiety attacks after i drink at the weekend
 Lifestyle:
 Sacked from work September 2013.
Quit smoking January 2014 and on E-Cig now.
Ex Girlfriend who lied about miscarriage 2012 has been on my mind day and night all the time, upset by it but trying to find closure.
Drink Alcohol Fri-Mon (Around 35 pints of beer over 3-4 days)
I stay in on my own tuesday, wednesday and thursday searching for jobs online.
I don't know if this has any relevance but i do masturbate 2 or 3 times a day and on my days inside on my own this is most of the day and night, I have a sexual Fetish (Again, no idea if this has any relevance)
 Can Any one relate to my problems?!?!?! constant worrying about my health is horrible.
 Thank you
Eddie
