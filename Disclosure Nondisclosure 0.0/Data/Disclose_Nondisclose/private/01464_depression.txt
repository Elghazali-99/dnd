I'm a 15 yo junior and I can not bring myself to go to school. I'm feeling so much stress and anxiety just building up in me like a dark blob taking me over. I'm scared because I didn't finish my summer assignments because I sat in bed all summer trying to convince myself to do them. My sister got married last week so I missed the first 2 days of school. This morning I got up and dragged myself around the house knowing my parents would make me go to school today and not take any excuses. I kept trying to come up with excuses like my foot tingling so I need to go to the hospital, or that it was foggy outside and might rain, the list goes on and on. When it finally comes for me to walk out the door, it's like I REALLY want to go learn and be successful and get good grades, but there's an alien in me too that will do anything to keep me from walking out that door. My parents are the opposite of help, too. They treat me like I'm an idiot and threaten to call the truancy officer because I really don't think they care about what I'm going through. I can't bring myself to talk about it because I think they'll just shut me down and say how that's such a "silly" way to feel. My feelings are perfectly described by the cycle do nothing-> feel guity-> panic about future-> feel powerless-> do nothing. It's like a hole spiraling down that's ruining my life and I'm just standing by watching it. I also especially feel anxiety because I'm a really good student and the thought of getting a bad grade  depresses the hell out of me. Also I get anxiety about what people think about me- teachers especially. The thought that a teacher might not like me is really scary, but also that I won't know anyone in my class when they already know each other. Sorry this post is kind of all over the place but I'm trying to relieve some anxiety by writing all this down. I don't know how to untangle myself from this mess.
