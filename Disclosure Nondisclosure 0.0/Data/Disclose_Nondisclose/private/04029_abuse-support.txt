I must thank everyone for their feedback, and ask for some more advise. 
 When I 1st posted this question, I was unsure of the situation and/or if I was over reacting. I chose to keep my son in the daycare as the director assured my that my son was safe. She assured me that she was monitering all staff and that it would be almost impossible for abuse of any kind to take place. She also said that if there were times that _____ (the teacher in question) was alone with the children, my son would be transfered to another room. I was not completely comfortable with this but, I want to believe that I am wrong.
 At dinner,Two nights ago, my son told me that _____ gives him lots of kisses when he is good. He said this out of the blue. I asked him where, and he pointed to his cheek and said here. Then he said "and here" as he pointed to his lips, his neck, his back , his inner thighs and his knees.This alarmed me, but I remained calm. I told him that he was a good boy and that "teacher" should not be kissing him there. My son got upset and said that ____ was his friend and is allowed to give him kisses. He also said that he liked to give _____ kisses too. Later that night, when I was trying to put my son to sleep, he started giving me small kisses on my arm. He said "say please and I'll do it again". I ased him "Want to you want me to say please for?" For more kisses he said! 
 I found this very disturbing! My son and I always give eacher hugs and kisses, but not in this manner, nor would he ever have to say please for my affection! I asked him who says this to him and he said _____! The next day I spoke with the daycare director. I remained very calm as I told her what happened. She got upset and told me that she could not believe this. I said that is not something that I am prepared to deal with, so please "tell me that I'm wrong"! I said that the last time we spoke about this I decided to keep my son in the daycare, but now I understandably am too uncomfortable with the situtation. She said that she would make sure that my son was not alone with _____  until I found a replacement daycare. 
 When I had expressed my concerns the last time I stated that I was not making any accusations, I only had concerns. Like I said, she told me that all of the other parents love ____.  I just find it very hard to believe that my son would make these things up. He is only 3 years old!
 So now again, she told me this and that I am the only one complaining. She said that after speaking with _____ and another staff member, she discovered that my son was the one that was expressing odd behavior towards _____! I told her that I would be removing my son from the daycare as soon as I could. I also said that as the director of the daycare she should welcome all parent concerns and investigate them.  When I picked my son up today from daycare she gave me a letter stating that she has addressed my concerns and has accepted my notice of termination, and that my son would no longer be attending as of Sept.28th/07.
 I am removing my son from the daycare center anyway, but I am angry with this situtation. I feel that my child means nothing to them! These are the people that my son trusts and relies on every day. Daycares play a huge part in the development of all children in their care. My son is with these care givers 5 days a week! So nobody else has a problem with this person, does this mean that we just ignore it? Could my 3 year old just be making all of this up? I don't believe that at 3 he even understands what is going on! Is it possible that this is commonly dismissed. Do I just let this go now? 
 I find it very hard to deal with the fact that I can not protect my child at all times. IWhat happens if another parent has the same concerns down the road? Has anybody been through a similar situation?
