I've looked online to see if it was possible or if I'm just paranoid, but I'm 19 and I've never had sex. There have been a few instances where I was naked but my bf was not and we've gone through foreplay before. My question is, is it possible for sperm/semen (whichever term you prefer) to travel through clothes? It may sound stupid yes, but I am a very paranoid and overly worried person. 
I've had a few weird changes; enlarged boobs and the lower part of my stomach (below my belly button) looks larger than normal. I also have this weird nausea like feeling at the end of my throat some times. 
I was planning on getting a hpt from the store but I'm not sure when the post time to take it would be, I'm supposed to have my period soon. 
Also, my last period was almost a week late, which is why I'm mainly so worried right now. 
I have tried to calm down, and try to stray from this topic but if something gets in my head it never leaves. 
Thank you in advance for any advice and sorry if there was TMI!
