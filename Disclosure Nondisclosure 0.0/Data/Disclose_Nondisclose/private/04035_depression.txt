hi I'm Luke I'm 28yr old old. I have a beautiful partner who I live with. You could say I have the world at my feet. It's far from the truth tho.
Iv been living with depression for over two years now. I'm the type of person who believes a man shouldn't cry and also a man  who puts every 1 first before myself.
Well how do I start.? 
I'm the man who puts on that fake smile to everyone he meets. I'm the man who is acting out that I'm doing fine and the world couldn't be any better than it is right now. All the people who know me think iv got everything but they don't understand, nobody does! 
It's like I'm living to separate life's. The brave happy Luke and the worried scared tearful Luke. When I'm alone all I do is cry,worry, and watch my world full apart at my feet. Iv been to the doctors and specialists for my depression but all they do is give you tablets and say you will start to feel better after a couple of months. I'm on 45mg mertazpine. Iv been on these for a while but all they do is make me tired and more depressed. Before you all say it, Iv talked to my partner about what I feel or think but she doesn't have a clue. I don't blame her for this as she is only trying to help. 
Iv been with partner for 8yrs. She fell in love with a muscular confident person which swept her off her feet but now I have this depression its making are relationship hard. It's like I can see us drifting apart but no matter how much I try to fix it. It don't seem to work. 
I have self harmed in the past to take away the pain for that split second. I'm a emotional wreck inside but I have to put on a brave face on the outside. 
I just don't no what to do no more and it's hard to carry on.
