Hi All,
 I am back again after an year and half.I ahd posted in another forum regarding my ongoing divorce and trauma associated with.All fasle allegations and trecherous ways used by my ex to get the divorce.
 Now it has been 10 years since we met in college ,married lived together on and off and separated for most part of it.The culture and community I belong to considers divorce to be horrible and women in our society are looked down upon if they are divorced.So form the age of 21 till now I had to lived a life of shame and guilr apparently for no fault of my own.
 Now here is my problem for which I am seeking help and advice:
I have terrible anger issues and get violent also.Everytime when I get angry there is a deep feeling of being wronged.And also the feeling of not wanting to tolerate any kind of suppression from anybody.
 Though things have been pretty rough recently ,I have started meditating and reading books like 'Poer of now' very recently.While I am working on my issues, I wanted to understand a few things.
 It might that I am sitting peacefully and doing smething ncely but all of a sudden a very small thing might trigger feelings of great hatred for many people all together.People who might not even be currently in my life,to people who will never harm me again to people who are major part of my life.....everything of what wrong they did comes in my mins and get angry and wild and hurt and tearful..i shout and let it out on those who are close to me......
and the shocking part is...it happens any time...even may be i might be in a perfect mood but a small trigger might turn me into a sad angry vilent persom....after the angry aepisode..i am left with guilt...anger and depression and hatred for myself for having no contro....i want to turn in a hppy helathy prson again...
does anybody have anything to say on this?
Thank you .
