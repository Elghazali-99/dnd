I have to go to court next week and testify against someone who physically assaulted me. I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and I have blocked out this assault. A detective showed me pictures of the assault and you would think that would spark some part of my memory but it didn't. This assault happened a few hours before a second assault by someone else. During the second assault my nose was broken, my sinus cavity was fractured 2 of my fillings were knocked out, and i was almost strangled to death. During the first attack i hit my head and suffered a concussion. You can see why I am having memory trouble. These attacks were in April. I spent most of the summer in the hospital dealing with my trauma but I still can't remember. I don't like being pushed into remembering. I was told by my doctor that I should not be pushed and that my brain is doing what it needs to do to protect me. She also said that to push me into remembering could be very dangerous for me and people around me. If I cant remember what happened they cant prosecute these individuals. It seems ok for the defendants to postpone the hearings when they want to but when I want to due to medical reasons I can't. I need advice from someone who has been there Thanks.
