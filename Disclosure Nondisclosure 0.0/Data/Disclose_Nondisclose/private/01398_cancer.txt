My wife is undergoing a second period of Chemo.  The first was about 3 years ago and best I can recall her side-effects were less, more tolerable than what she is experiencing now.
 The first Chemo was a followup for cancer surgery that removed female organs.  That took about a year and at the end we even made a trip by car from NJ to Cape Coral FL.  She had her last two treatments there. 
 She was free of any signs of cancer for about a year then lung nodules appeared and she was returned to Chemo treatment.  This time she has a much harder time with sickness side-effects:  upset stomach, diarrhea, then constipation.  This cycle may be Chemo, then diarrhea which leads to treating diarrhea which leads to constipation.  In any case with Chemo once a week the cycle of side-effects about fills the time between Chemo, and time to start over again.
 I understand the question can't be answered without knowing what Chemo and how much.... 
 Perhaps this post can at least lead to some one saying they experienced the same thing.
 I go with my wife for her Chemo treatment and consultation with her Oncologist, so I can ask next time/week.  It would still be interesting to know if anyone else has experienced the same troubling side-effects.
 I close giving my best this Memorial Day to those who have paid the price of protecting our freedoms.  This is for all both those who directly served and their family members and friends.
