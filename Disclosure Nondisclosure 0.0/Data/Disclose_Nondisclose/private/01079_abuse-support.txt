I have a friend who I haven't talked to in 3 months call me today she said she hadnt talk to me because her boyfriend broke her phone and that now he's in jail but the story just dont add up to why I haven't spoken to her in so long but her boyfriend is very nice when he's sober. He's alcoholic an occasional coke snorter & he pops pills at one point he even had her poppin pills & to be honest I thought he'd turned her into a drugy when we wasnt talkin b/c she was just M.I.A. but im really worried about her and I don't know what to say to her without pushing her away or making her feel even worse here's what she told me today...
 4 nights ago while she was sleeping her boyfriend stole her car and went out and got drunk and high he wrecked it & left it on the side of the road she said the next morning he came into the house still sloppy drunk and high out of his mind she said she asked him where her car was and he told her it was inpound she said they then got into a huge argument and he jumped on her and choked her she said she grabbed her phone and was trying to call her parents then he took the phone and broke it she then went to a neighbors house to use their phone she said he followed her into the neighbor's house and was knocking their pictures off the wall the neighbor asked him to leave and he did she said he returned back to the neighbors house with his gun &was yellin if you let her use your phone I'm going to shoot her in the face they wouldn't open the door so he started shooting at the door the neighbors called the police and he was arrested on multiple charges and on top of all of it her 3 year old son was with her..her family his family and I have told her that she needs to leave him because he threatens that when he gets out of jail he's going to kill her but she continues to stay at the apartment that they share and said that she's not afraid of him I tell her that she's being crazy and that she has a son to worry about but she has sent her son to her mother and she continue to stay at the apartment they share she also said that she plans on going to visit him in jail Sunday and that if he refuse to see her that she's going to be hurt she said that she wants to still be with him because it's hard to go from being with somebody everyday and then not being with them at all and to my understanding this isn't the first time that this has happened she says when he gets high & drunk he turns into another person that he has hit her and pulled his gun out on her before she said he spends all the money on drugs and alcohol and she be the 1 having to get the bills together herself I really don't know what to say to her because it's like she knows better but she just don't want to leave she's 1 of my best friends and I don't know what I would do if something horrible happened to her and at the rate they're going I believe something will do anybody have any advice on what I should do or what I should say to her I was in a verbal abusive relationship once but it only took him 1 time to hit me and I left but some people are stronger than others she said that his mother was abused by his father years ago but he has changed and she believed that him and her will be the same 1 day and I tried to explain to her that people are different but she's just being so naive anyone have any advice...???
