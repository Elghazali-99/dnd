I have no idea where this goes under, so here it goes...
 Recently, I have been worrying a lot about what to decide for my future, stay at where I am now for my career or going back to my home country for good. I have asked for parents opinion, though they say I can continue with my own choices, but in couple of occasion, mom said its no good staying here or sth, dad said why not further your studies or sth. However, I am doing my masters now and I feel its a bit too much already. I am thinking more of staying here, but with the permanent residency even harder starting from July 2011, I don't know what to do. A lot of time, I am worrying with my decision, the decision that I make now benefits me or is doing the other way? I feel like I think too far into the future, and I do realised that uncertainty of what will happen is stressing me out. A lot of time, I feel sad and worried over things and to one extent, I find it hard to focus and concentrate with my studies. Other than that, I feel like a lot of the things, of which I enjoyed doesn't make me enjoy or happy anymore..and I feel very tired at all times, no matter how much I have slept, it feels like I have not slept much at all..I am also overeating comparing to before....In numerous occasions, I find that I am talking to myself in relation to anything, to others, to one extent, I am worrying what is going on with me? In recent occasions, I find myself crying when trying to consult opinions from friends or other adults. I have not been behaving like this at all before. I am worrying at some point, how do I overcome these issues? I thought of talking to a psychologist but before taking the next extreme, I just want to make sure. To one extend, other than stress, I feel like I am having depression or generalised anxiety disorder...I really need the help//
