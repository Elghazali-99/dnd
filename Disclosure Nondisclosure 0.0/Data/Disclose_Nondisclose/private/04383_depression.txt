I'm desperate. 
 Ever since high school, I've aimed at looking like I have it altogether. I'm graduating college soon and I have a bunch of academic accomplishments. 
 There is a darker side. I have a lot of emotional upsets that I've never let myself get over. Instead my self-esteem plummeted and has NEVER returned. I started being perfectionistic, numbing myself to pain as much as I could, withdrawing from people important to me. I left strings of broken friendships and relationships behind. It's become the way I live life. 
 Something happened today (won't get into it) that just broke the camel's back and I have NO friends to talk about this to. That's because I've made myself into the one people come TO. The people I COULD talk to, make the conversation about THEM every time. I hide my problems from my family and others, don't want to upset them. 
 I'm also getting ready to get into a career that I CANNOT HANDLE right now, realistically. It may look like I can, but I can't. 
 Worst part is...I've been in counseling off and on for about 2 years and my counselors don't think I'm crazy. No one seems to think I have serious problems but ME. I've been on medications before, and they were not for me. 
 I've been living my life on a shaky foundation and no one knows it but me. I don't even realize it til I'm shaking and sobbing alone, after yet another personal frustration rears its head during the day. It's so easy for me to fall right back into the old routine of burying my emotions down once the sun comes up.  
 I don't know what to do anymore. I can't go on like this, but I don't know how to stop. I really just don't know. I need more help than ever.
 If you don't understand, try to imagine falling down once upon a time, getting back up and brushing yourself off but strangely...not the same person anymore. And you keep walking through life as this strange person. This is what's going on. 
 Any advice...please.
