Possible Deviated Septum?
What can i do about it, im 17 nearly 18, im guessing it won't change much? I don't want a perfect nose, but i have an indent look at the end of my nose which leads me to lose alot of confidence and everywhere i go it's on my mind. It's like a pinch look, not sure if that makes sense but yeah really bothers me, and looks different from angles. I just want a nose where it looks the same in the morning and night and aint a different size on one side to the other. At the top of my nose if you run your finger down it feels a bit "wonky" inside, some people have said i may have a deviated septum?
 It really affects me, think it may be on my dads genetics but you can't see his at all unless your looking for it, same goes for my brothers, so i don't see why i have it so bad, would breaking it make it heal back normal. I can't afford surgery could i get this done on the NHS?

 Would you believe this was the same nose, again from a different angle

 When i smile (mouth stretched) you can see on the left side of my nose it goes inwards a bit, like it's wonky, i think this is causing the bit connecting my nostrils to be more on the left side, surely this isn't normal? Also if i use a finger and move the end of my nose from side to side it'll click, can i get this sorted, i hardly breathe out of my nose, mainly just my mouth which i don't believe is healthy, this could be a reason why?
 I'm really scared what can i do about it
