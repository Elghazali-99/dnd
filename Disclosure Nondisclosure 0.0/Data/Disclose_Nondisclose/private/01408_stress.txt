I just went to the store tonight, i was daring. Well i cant say daring..because i have 3 younger kids and i HAVE to go out. I cant just sit here. Driving is usually a big thing for me, when i hit traffic, i get one bad. ( panic)...I feel trapped. Anyways, on the way there I was doing good, i got inside Lowe's, which i usually can not go to because its huge to me. I get in line, and I felt it coming on, my face got sooo hot, my eyes felt like they were shaking, i was struggling to see straight, got lightheaded, and shaky...i just wanted to run out the big doors. I tried to hurry the cashier as much as possible. When i got my change, i practically ran out of the store. I dont get the eye shaking at home, only when i go out in public. On the way home what do you know i was getting every light RED...i would almost panic sitting in the line of cars. I was sweating.....I made it home but now my face is still hot. Sometimes, i will come home and get chills..real bad. Tonight i also have a slight headache now, and my face feels flushed. I am under so much stress right now...and have been for a long time.
