Dear Reader, 
 I re-posted this here because i dont think my other post went through but anyway...
 I have a 16 year old cousin she is very close to me, I am extremely worried about her, her behavior seems out of the ordinary at times one thing she told me that she dreams about zombies all the time that's less of the worry's that i'm carrying about her but the major ones in reality is that she stays quiet when shes being spoken to and when i look at her she seems quite teary and when she does talk she comes out with really weird stuff but it is really funny no one would think of it to be honest and also if you **** her off she will throw anything close to her at you no matter how much the pain will cause. 
She seems to want to spend time on her own and sit in complete silence she smokes quite a bit she scratches herself and asked me ''do i ever feel like there are little insects crawling on your body'' also she doesn't sleep she does but every other night or so and in the mornings she seems very energetic. 
 She often laughs or smiles for no reason and i know she doesn't hear voices and she can never be bothered to take care of herself e.g full showers she'll only be bothered to do that like once a month she'll just wash her hair over the bath she used to self harm don't know if she has done it recently but when i saw her one shocking evening she told me she has to see blood if she doesn't she said she feels kind of stress and weird and her arm was drenched with blood it was traumatizing to see, she never cares how she looks and she always tries to avoid help or avoid letting people know how shes truly feeling. She gets quite violent sometimes really violent  shes not usually the violent type at times shes very relaxed but only for a certain amount of time i've said to her before maybe you should go to a doctor and she refuses she said she doesn't need to talk to no one. . . .
