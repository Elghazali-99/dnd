Hi all Ive been having some issues with my family's understanding of my condition & I want to thank everyone at MedHelp who has been so kind to help me! My doctor put me on prozac 20 mg 1x/day for anxiety last week and I started taking the pills last Thursday pm so I have been taking them for one week only (today was my last pill). My parents are against psychiatry completely and my mom found the pills today. We got in a big fight and she asked me to flush them. I wasn't reluctant, I just didn't want the drama so I flushed them gladly. I also didn't like how the anti-depressants made me so forgetful. Then I read up on withdrawal symptoms from anti-depressants. I have only been taking them a week. I have never taken any other anti-depressant medication before. Also, I must note that this medication is for anxiety, not depression. Will I have horrible withdrawals? I see my doctor again on the 18 and I am telling him that I want to stop the medication all together. I thought I needed it, but I really want to conquer my issues with therapy and the now loving support of my family (in any means non-pharmocological of course!) I won't be able to see him until then. Will I have horrible withdrawal symptoms since I only took them for one week? Please let me know! :D
