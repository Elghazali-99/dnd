I'm begging you, this has gone on for far too long!!
 So to get to the point, I am a 14yr old female who has been extremely unhealthy for almost a year. It will be a year in October. I have been suffering from ongoing lung pains and in July some lymph nodes flared up in my left collarbone. I went to the doctors and I had a chest x-ray and stuff and they said I was fine. About a month ago, I noticed a lump in my back, below the left ribcage and it seems to be attached to the bone. It is about 3cm, but WAS 2cm or less when it was first there. It never showed up in the x-ray because I only got it AFTER the x-ray and bloodtests and stuff. It is absolutely painless, and hard as the bone. But it wasn't there in July. I also am having bruises appear and get larger on my legs. One is 2.5 inches across. I also have severe fatigue and dizzyness. I have fainted a couple of times.
 That's about it. Tell me what you think I should do!! (I'm going to the hospital on Thursday this week, for your information.)
