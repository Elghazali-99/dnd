I think I am suffering from some type of disorder, bipolar runs in my family but I dont think it is that, I am extremely anxious, worry constantly and work myslef up over nothing I get in real bad moods when I get stressed and I get stressed quite easily, today I was trying to pack up after a weekend a way and could'nt watch my 3 year old and pack and asked my 11 year old to watch him, an hour later she was still lying in bed and I was screaming at her telling her she was lazy, I felt so bad afterwards and wanted to cry and felt like an unfit mother and was thinking my kids would be better off without me not that I would commit suicide I would'nt be that selfish. I just cant help and lose it and get extremly panicked that something bad will happen. I also compulsively wash my hands a million times a day until they are raw and wont touch handles of doors etc and check doors and plugs non stop even when I know they are closed/off, I get the kids to treble check. I have spoke to my dr on several occasions and he ignores me, he gave me Johns wort once but didnt find any difference. I dont want to be like this, I dont want to be moody and get annoyed for nothing, I want to be normal but dont want to take medication, I tried conselling a year ago but felt it made me worse as I had a very bad childhood and it brought a lot of it back, at my wits end, dont know what to don, any advice would be appreciated. Thanks
