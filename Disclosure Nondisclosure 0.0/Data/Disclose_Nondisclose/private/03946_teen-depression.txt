Hi , my name is tori and I am 13 years old. During the past weaks I have had a really bad outlook on life. When I was young my father would physically, emotionly, and mentaly abuse me. I am not very popular at school so I kinda get picked on. I have also been sexally abused at a young age ( have never told anybody). I just feel like the past and those awful memories of my past keep haunting me. I cry myself to sleep every night. I just hate life and I feel that its useless. I have suisidal thought every day ( I one day had a knife in my hand and was intending on using it and I was going to hang myself also). I don't cut myself but the only reason I don't kill myself it because how selfish that would be, my baby/dog co co, and the fear of whats beyond. I also have a struggle with wieght although I am thin I look at way more populer and pretty and thin girls with me so that constanly stresses me out. I am not a people person and turn to sometimes acohol and my animals for comfort. I have plenty of friends but i dont think they would understand.I have been to  plenty of therapists but they do not help at all. My mom is also a big part of my life and I don't want to let her down. I have been forgave my dad though. I just hate life and just really want to die. I also do not want to tell my family because they will think im making this up and is doing this for attention which is the complete opposite. I am not crazy and  am very smart so, I don't need pills to make life easier... I just dont know whats going on.
