My 30 year old brother (we'll call him Dave) has been depressed for several years and has attempted suicide before. He lives with my dad and my other brother (we'll call him Tom) and is just generally miserable. I recently found out from Tom that Dave has been experimenting with drugs like steroids, meth, molly, xanax, cialis, etc. He says that Dave doesn't do these all the time, just periodically, and he thinks that they are being mailed to the house. My dad is completely unaware that this is going on. Tom had to take Dave to the ER a couple of months ago because he thought he OD'd on a meth/cialis combo. I would really like to have an intervention for Dave. Tom is unsure if drug rehab is appropriate because it's less obvious that the drugs are the real issue especially since he doesn't do them ALL the time (except for weed). He thinks he needs an actual mental health facility, rather than rehab. What WOULD be the most appropriate setting for my brother to receive help? Thank you!
