Hi there i recently went to the doctors as i have had a lump behind my ear for 4 years and i am recently getting pains in my chest and i think that cancer has spread from this lump to my lungs. However my doctor insisted he couldnt feel anything sinister and said that he could see i was worried so wasnt going to leave me worried and would try to prove my thoughts wrong so he has set up an appointment for me to get my bloods taken that will cover everything, thyroid levels, the lot! He said he has to do this because he cant send me to a head and neck specialist without any reason. My mum and dad have told me that these bloods that are getting tooken will show not necessarily that i have cancer but that my body is fighting something as sinister as cancer and if they come back and are healthy then i should stop worrying as i am driving myself literally insane as my mum and dad feel that every symptom i am getting is being created by my mind but im not having it as i know theres a fleshy hard immovable lump behind my ear that i think is a sarcoma and ive absolutely convinced myself i have cancer and it has spread to my lungs and im going to die
