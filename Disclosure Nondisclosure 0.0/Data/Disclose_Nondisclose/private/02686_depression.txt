Hi, so I have depressed for a while now I used to be depressed about 1yr ago and then I stopped like I would cry my self to sleep every day sometimes for reasons and most of the time for non I tried to talk to my mom about it she made it worse for me. Then I started cutting, which I regret doing so bad and then afterwords I suddenly stopped. Now for about a month I'm back to being depressed and it's getting worse it caused me to have anorexia which made me now a bulimic I tried to kill my self when I was in a room with my cozins and out of no where I started crying then I took a key and cut my wrist and started getting out of control. I was so close to killing my self but they basically saved Me from that. One of the reasons from depression is cuz I moved somewhere that I hate because all my freedom goes away my family changes like 3 very thing changed. So I'm alone In this there is no one I know that I can trust, all I want to know is how can I stop with this depression
