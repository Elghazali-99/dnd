I am a 45 year old male.  I have suffered depression all of my life, feeling sad as far back into childhood as I can remember.  I spent many, many years self-medicating (alcohol+drugs).  I know for me, I have tried 16 different anti-depressants and other than the ones that gave me severe nausea and the ones that made me feel like a walking Zombie (Effexor, Seroquel and Olanzapine), the others did nothing.  From what I have read as well as independent, double-blind studies done by universities (not drug company trials), they showed that for mild to moderate depression, a sugar pill was sometimes more effective than any of the SSRI, SARI, anti-psychotics,Tri-cyclics, etc. meds.  So that would indicate that because you think you are feeling better due to the drug while in fact it is only a placebo effect.  These drugs have, however shown to be quite helpful in people with SEVERE depression.  People with Mild to Moderate depression have found relief in Suboxone (Buprenorphine/Naloxone) or Subutex.  However, beware that Buprenorphine, although only being a partial opiate-agonist has a VERY high affinity for the same receptors in your brain as painkillers/heroin.  So you will become addicted to it and will become very, very sick for quite a long time if you stop it.  Dosages as low as 2mg (4mg max) should be all you need.  This drug is used as an adjunct therapy for opiate addicted people normally but has been used off label for regular treatment resistant depression so it is regulated much the same as Methadone and has the same type of rules.  However, if your doctor prescribes it for depression (if he/she is able to) you may not have to jump through the same hoops as an addict does (pee samples once/week, doctor visits once/month)
