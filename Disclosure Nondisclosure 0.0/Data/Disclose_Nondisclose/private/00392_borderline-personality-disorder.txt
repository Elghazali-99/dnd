My husband who has been recently diagnosed is telling me he is going to commit suicide. He is currently living with his sister as I am looking after our 2 teenage boys. He is not coping with the seperation so has informed me that unless me and the boys keep in contact with him, he will commit suicuide. Through pressure from him, I let him meet with the boys and told them to be open and honest with them. They told him they didn't want him to ring them and they will ring him when they are ready which might be a while. He pulled me aside before we left and said "you know the rate of suicide for this disorder, so are you prepared that this will happen? I felt enormous guilt taking the boys to see him and asking them to be honest with him. I'm scared if he does harm himself, the boys will carry the guilt of having said to him that they don't want to see him? We are under professional help, but he keeps changing therapists because he doesn't like them confronting the issues. I am feeling extremely stressed at the moment. Does anyone have any suggestions or similiar experiences that could help me.
