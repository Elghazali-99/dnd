I am 25 yrs male.I want to share my story.i want to know the truth please help me.In short am saying.i had a friend who is girl.we were close.she behaved more than a friend.i told her not to be close.one day we had a forplay.next week she said she was pregnant.i was shocked but believed.she said she abortioned without me.later i was forced into love her because her sister told me i am responsible for pregnancy.i said ok in guilt.later i tried to breakup due to mismatch of thinking.when ever i go away i would get a call or message from her sister tht my gf got brain stroke,suicide atempt,running from home,live or death problem etc.,which i would consider real but i didnt believe.i always went back bileving its true,but when i go back everything was just back to normal.shes perfectly healthy.later i could not tolerate these games.i became completley angry and became abusive.i never met her sister though.but a imaginary name on call or mesage.how ever her sisters voice is similar to my gf which i bileved as a diffrent person.Now after a strong fight i was framed as a abusive person infront of all my common friends i was warned by their family not to disturb her.i was devastated with this.i lost my life for 3 years .i was good i never left when she was said ill or financially down.So who abused whom ? What is this all about ? Did she love me at all or just want to play games for fun? I never ran for any women.i am top of class and top of my office.I always was a straight forward and honest person.please give me whats her mind set is??
