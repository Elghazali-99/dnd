Hi-
I'm about to turn 15 and I've been feeling down in the dumps for about 7 months. I don't feel energetic at all and my mind is often fuzzy, like I'm trying to think through a cloud. I feel so alone even though I have a few friends. I love music a lot, but lately I haven't wanted to listen to it so much, and I feel like my old self is slipping away. I feel like I can't talk to anybody that will listen and like nobody cares about me. I sometimes cry for no reason, but then I give myself a reason to, like that I'm alone and I don't matter to any body.
This has been going on during a time where I'm trying to find myself, and this depression is starting to become me. My friends say that I make them feel sad just because I look so down. I've asked them if they're going through what I am, and one friend said no, and that I should go see my doctor because it worries her to see me so sad. Another said that she goes through what I go through, and it's just growing up. But she is WAY more energetic and lively than I am. I haven't had a loss of appetite as far as I know and I sleep pretty well. I have thought about suicide, but I've never seriously considered it.
I'm not sure if this is normal and if I should be going through this, or if something is wrong with me and I should see a doctor. I don't want to go if nothing is wrong with me because everybody will think I'm crying wolf and want attention, which I don't at all.
Thank you for any help,
Alex
