I'm diagnosed with ADHD and depression at 25mg amphetamine tab daily (15 morning, 10 lunch), and 15mg Sertraline every breakfast, respectively. Regarding the ADHD, my psychiatrist told me I should probably take a "pill holiday" with the Adderall every once in a while when I don't study or when I am not doing much work. I tried that once, but I think it somewhat threw off my treatment for depression. I seemed to have gotten some of my symptoms back for depression (I think it's getting better now). My questions are as follows:
 1. I didn't really consider a "pill holiday" for Adderall since I thought that it was like anti-depressants, in that Adderall needed to build up in my system for my body to get acclimated to for chemical balance or whatnot. Anyway, apparently that's not the case if I can take a "pill holiday". I took a pill holiday, and for several days afterwards while on my regular regimen again, I experienced my depression symptoms. Does the lack of Adderall somehow affect the chemical balance, or does it make the affects of Sertraline less effective? I read that Sertraline amplifies the effects of Adderall, but I'm wondering if the negative inverse is true - does lack of Adderall impede Sertraline in any way?
 2. I've been on Zoloft 15mg for about 3-4 months or so. Does Zoloft lose its effectiveness in that time period, or rather, could it? I'm sure it's different for different people, and I read that for other people, Zoloft lost its effectiveness after 3 years, and others after 15 years! Anyway, I'm going to consult my psychiatrist to see if I need to up my dose or if I should consider a more consistent, stable, and long term oriented anti-depressant.
 Thanks in advance.
