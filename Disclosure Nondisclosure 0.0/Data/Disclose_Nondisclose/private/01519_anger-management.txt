There are some times where I get these incensing thoughts and they quickly ignite anger in me. When I was a child I used to lash out, however I had been told to "hold it in and control it" as best as possible.
 Nowadays, though, it's different. The more I try to hold it in, the more it ends up hurting (it's like someone carved a hole in your chest and started gushing flaming hot air in that "hole"). It robs me of my ability to think rationally, so I try not to interact with others lest I say and/or do something offensive to others (that I can't take back once said). However, the overwhelming desire to ease the pain it brings gives me a huge urge to at least try to talk or act - otherwise my anger might rip me apart.
 There's no one around to really talk about this with (I have therapy for only one hour during the few days of the week that I have it), so how should I go about dealing with an anger that A)causes me physical AND mental pain & suffering, B)kills all of my motivation and confidence, and C)pretty much requires all of my sanity to keep in check WHILE it makes me tired?
 Most all of the things I've tried have only given temporary relief (very small amounts that wear off quickly), so I'm kinda looking for something that can reduce this problem from "happens almost every day" to "happens every so often", and at least reduce the level to something manageable. Is there any way that I can deal with this issue in that manner?
