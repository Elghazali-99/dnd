Hello,
I am 34 years old and I wanted to know if I could be going through menopause. For the last year I have been having migraine headaches, mood swings and sleep loss. Just recently in the last 6 months my periods have been irregular (starting later than normal) my period used to be (for the last 21 years) 7 to 10 days long with 5 to 6 heavy heavy days. Now they last 4 to 5 days with 1 to 2 heavy days the rest of the days spotty. Now just in the last 4 months I have been having in addition to the other listed symptoms I have been having mood swings (crying at tv and raging over small things) and hot flashes along with night sweats so bad I get up and change in the middle of the night and have to put a towel on the bed. Oh yeah I have also been having some serious vaginal dryness. I only have wondering all of this because I had these symptoms about 8 years ago when I was taking Lupron injections for my endometriosis. I have also had my tubes tied since 2001 and had to have a LEEP done due to stage 1 squamous cell carcinoma. Could this really be menopause at 34?? Please a little insight on this would be great
Thank you
