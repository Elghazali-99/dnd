I was standing in the kitchen perfectly fine making food when a loud bang when of in the kitchen from the gas stovetop (I of course assumed the worse thinking the house was going to blow up, it was just the gas running out) immediately my heart was pounding like crazy and all that normal anxious stuff which I get a lot cause I'm quite an anxious person. However it didn't end there, I must admit i was still stressing about the gas and the noise happened a few more times, I started getting more sweaty and clammy (which i didn't think much of either) but It was really bad and I can still feel it as I write this, I also got shooting stabbing pains down my back which mixed with the sweat felt horrible, my head was hurting and I somehow convinced myself that I hadn't eaten enough so I finished making food although my hands were shaking throughout it so i was moving really slow and kept almost dropping things. I was also spent all my energy on just standing up, not sure how I did it guess I was determined to eat the food as I thought it would give me energy. I searched my symptoms online and while most sounded really wrong panic attack symptoms sounded slightly similar. I was thinking maybe a really mild one? I felt horrible and it was definitely painful and everything but I wasn't exactly terrified and I didn't feel like I was dying I was more like my body was glitching and my mind was just watching. (I have had weirder more painful experiences than this when I thought I really was going to die so maybe that was why I wasn't that scared) Overall I am really confused and just don't want to have on again, I only thought it was a panic attack cause I got a huge fright and then my body kinda freaked out and sweating and shaking and there was stabbing shooting pains down my back and I got all weak and only just know after 15min after it 'ended' I feel normal again. 
I hope someone can send me in the right direction because as i said before I have had weirder but similar things happen that can't be virus related as everything goes back to normal about 15 min after. ugh
