im a 17 years old girl ... and i feel horrible sometimes .. i can say that i have everything i need . but even so, sometimes i feel so depressed .. and i dont know why ... maybe being bored most of the time  is one of the reason , and the fact that  i learn  everyday that  can't trust anyone .. most of the people around me lie to my face ... even if they know that i  hate liars .. my best friend and i have been fighting a lot lately , and everyday i realize that  those that i call my friends  are around just me for their  intrests ... and i these days i see my self as a ugly girl even if i try to convince my self the opposite , its like nothing i do to improve my look works so i just give up ... and i dont even try to look at the mirror , i just go out with a sad face   sometimes i wonder why im alive ? but then i try to think about something else so i dont get even more depressed.. people see me and think that im happy because i laught a lot ... but what they don't know that deep inside me i cry even more .. sometimes i say to my self that nothing matter ..not my friends not my family not my studies , nothing , then i hear real life caling and i return to my daily life with all of it problems .. maybe the reason why im still so sad and depressed is that i never deal with my problems  .. but im not sure , im not sure of any thing in my life right now .. and i feel that all my choices are wrong  ... please ,, help me ... what should i do ? ? ?
