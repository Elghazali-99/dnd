My son is now 7 years old and has been diagnosed with ADD. Although he is not a bad child I constantly worry he may show signs of depression or possibly BPD. I always felt that something was wrong with me growing up, but I plastered a smile on my face to blend in. And I especially didn't want anyone to think I was crazy, but now that I'm a mother seeking help for my disorder I don't want my child to go through what I've been through. I want to help him through these times and teach him how to cope. I have been through a lot like most people walking this earth, but looking back if only I knew what the source of my problem was I think I could have changed a lot bad outcomes in my life. I am currently on medication that helps, but I still feel as if I need something else to take so that I can be a better mother to my son. My son has witnessed behaviors of mine that I'm not proud of and his dad and I split up when he was only 2. Now 5 years later we are back together and I feel terrible as a mother because over the years I have put my son through unnecessary situations. He is extremely bright with great potential to grow up to be the man I believe in my heart  he will be, but the what if's of my gene being passed onto him scares me. My boyfriend wants another child and I'm starting to get cold feet because I don't want to birth a child into this world that will possible suffer as I did. God knows I want another child, but fear has creped in and has me frozen in this state of mind. Thank you for taking the time to read my post and I look forward to hearing your responses. Skiey
