Can one have a depression without being constantly sad/down? My family says they think I have a depression, but I don't feel like the usual symptoms like sadness, lethargy, sleeping too much etc fits that well in my case. I have more of a constant feeling that something is "off" or "not quite right" (with no real life cause), uneasiness, sometimes moodswings, irritable, crying more often and more easily then usual.. Some days I'm just totally misrable and dont want to do anything and can barely get food down, while some days I'm ok and can easily laugh at funny things on TV etc.. but it seems I'm never better then ok and I always have this feeling that something's off and I don't seem to enjoy things I like as much as I used to. Can barely stand being around people and most days I feel completely drained even before I've set foot at work. I cringe if someone at work asks how my day is cause I feel like I don't want to be seen, much less have someone notice that I'm not my usual self. Anyone else had depression like this? And did antidepressants work?
