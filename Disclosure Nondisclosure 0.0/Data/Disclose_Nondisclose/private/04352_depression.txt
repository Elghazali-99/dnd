So, I'm 16 and I've been thinking about my life since I was 12. It started just by thinking about some problems I had back then, simple stuff like a grade lowering or so, but then with time it evolved to other stuff like I don't feel appreciated by ANYONE. Lately I've been feeling even more that I have no use for anyone and I'm completely worthless, nobody needs me for anything,the world would be exactly the same without me. The girl I like talked to me a a lot, she has similar problems, and I helped her dealing with it, but then we started talking less and less... And now I went back to feeling worthless and of no use to anyone. My parents divorced when I was around 6 and as a child I didn't care,but when I became a teen I noticed the impact it had in me. My mom always working, me being alone days and days, seeing her only at night, even then I was worthless -.- I've even imagined what it would be like if I died, what would change? The answer is, I think nothing would change. My mom has one other son, so my non-existant place would be taken by him, nobody would even notice I was gone. When I talk to my family I change from a light mood nice person to a angry and bitter person,probably because I seriously want them all away from me, but at the same time I want their love and approval, then again at the same time I don't want anything from them but distance. Am I completely crazy? Is this depression or just a little drama from a stupid teen?
