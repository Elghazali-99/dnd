I had sex with my boyfriend of a year and a half, we both are 20, i cannot recollect when the exact date was.  But i haven't had my period at all for the month of July, and a few weeks ago i had a slight spotting, but it only occured once.  I thought it was the initiation of my period, but nothing happened.  My boyfriend did his research and told me it might be because of stress, which i was going through because of some family issues.  
 So i tried to not stress out too much and just take it easy. But recently, i have been feeling nauseous (i have not throw up) and for the past 2 days i have been having head aches.  And was dizzy a few nights ago.  I took a HPT and it came out negative.  
 I am very young and i dont want children till 25 and later.   I am in a very happy & healthy relationship, but i dont think we are ready for a child. We are in college and living with our parents, and i feel like having a family at a young age always ends up with the biological parents seperated, majority of the time. This is my first time actually have deep feelings for someone and it has took me a long while to get me here, i do not want to add stress on to our relationship.  But i want everything to do smooth if i am or i am not.  
 Is there any advice and motivating thoughts about young parenthood, and if i MIGHT be pregnant?
 Please do not lecture me about using condoms, and birth control. I have already spent time analyzing it deeply.
