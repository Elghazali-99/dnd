Hi,
 My mum,66 yr old has been diagnosed with Disorganized-type Schizophrenia like 1 month back.
Her doc has prescribed Nuzak and Risperidone 1mg. Risdone side effect was that she was peeing on the bed( which I found on the internet is a side effect that affect some people).This kinda added more stress on her. I requested the doctor to change risdone, which he did. 
Now she is under Nuzak (x1 in the morning) and Olanzapine 5mg (x1 at night)
 Just checked her and found out that with Olanzapine 5mg, the side effect of peeing on bed still persists. I am thinking about decreasing the dosage to 2.5mg. Already asked the doc, he said ok.
 My concerns are:
 1. She missed to take risdone on friday and today she was thinking about death. Do you think that's because she did not take the risperidone and that's why she was like this?
 2. Anyone under Olanzapine who pee on bed? If yes, how long does this side effect last?
 3. Any way that I can prevent her to pee on bed? (because she feels down when she sees that she pee on the bed)
 4. Disorganized-type Schizophrenia - Is treatable? Or she will forever be like this?
 I do not know what I can do more to help her. And I feel that she does not want to get better.... Its like she loses touch with reality and its affecting everyone at home.
 Thanks,
Wendy
