I'm new here and need help and directions. For about 4 weeks now I've been having the worst pressure in my uterus like if I was pregnant and the baby dropped as well as sore breast, and my face now has bumps. I went to the doctor to find out what was going on and she did a pelvic exam and said my uterus was enlarged and ordered an ultrasound that day. She found a fibroid tumor on my uterus(1cm) as well as a 2cm mass on my left ovary. She's doing the wait and see approach and wants me to come back in 6-8 weeks. However when I saw her it was on 10/02 and I've had a period since. I still have this pressure and now it's to the point where my back aches and I'm just extremely tired and feel off. I'm concerned and don't know what is happening with me. I'm bloated and if I'm up and around alot I feel the pressure even more. I used to work out all the time prior to this and was able to jog and now I can not do anything like that or I'll pay for it that night and the next day. I'm 34 years old and have history of breast cancer in my family as well as my father just passed away on 06/11/2014 of pancreatic cancer. Please give me hope that this isn't cancer. I'm so afraid to die and leave my children and husband. I know the pain of watching a parent go through cancer and in the end pass away as I'm still grieving the loss of my father. I don't want my children to go through that as they're 6 and 11. I know this sounds so selfish like I'm writing myself off but I feel so wrong and have no solution and it seems she doesn't either. She told me to use a heating pad and take the ibuprofen 600 for the pain. I called yesterday and they told me to relax and the doctor would call me tomorrow (which is today) and It's almost 3pm CST and I still haven't heard anything from her. Shoudl I request her do another ultrasound or am I just over reacting?
Thank you for any responses or assistance I'm freaking worried!
