this all started last year....it might sound weird but this started when i got my heart broken by a guy who wasnt even worth it. he used to tell me a lot of thing's that hurt and eventually got stuck in my head. I cant do anything with out those words always creeping up. It's like that evil voice in my head when i try to be happy or force myself too i cant because it always come's up. it's gotten to a point where all of a sudden i just get angry and i cant control it, i dont speak to anybody when i get angry because i'll lash out on them but sometimes i feel as if i dont care and do it anyways. its also gotten to the point where i get these pounding headaches that start from the bottom of my ears and raise up to the top of my head. i sometimes feel dumb because i cant think when i get those head aches it's like i loose my train of thought and go blank. my mother says i'm to young to be feeling like this..and its true im only 16. a 16 year old shouldnt feel like this its true but at times i cant control what is going on in my head. my parents are afraid of me because they dont know if im happy or sad or mad. but at times they dont seem to understand that im angry with myself , i have this thing in my head that i dont do anything right that and i get frustrated with myself. not with my parents or little sister, its me. and i hate it! i also have my boyfriend whom i love and adore so much , i know he doesnt deserve me being mad 100% of the time which i feel like i am. i just need help trying to control my anger..my thoughts i dont know how too
