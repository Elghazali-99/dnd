Ok so I'm 15 but I'm pretty mature because of my past, and I think I'm suffering depression. I had a bad upbringing with my alcoholic mom and now I live with my nan most of the time, and spend a few days a week with my dad and my brothers, we all get on well. And I'm clever, I know I am, but recently my grades have been slipping. And I have a few close friends too but recently I can't be bothered with them. And all I want to do is sleep, like all the time. And at night I get into bed but I don't sleep because I just stay up thinking and crying until the early hours, which means I wake up late, but even then I feel exhausted. And I think I love this boy, but he has a girlfriend and he just picks me up and drops me whenever he wants me.. so that doesn't help. And I hate who I am, sometimes I think "I'm not too ugly and I could be fatter" and feel like I'm ok, but most of the time I hate myself and just hide away, just give up on bothering to look good.I just don't know what to do anymore. It feels like I'm floating through life, just existing, just because I don't have the courage to end my life. And I've considered it, but I'm even too much of a coward to do it. I don't know so I was hoping someone has some ideas on what it could be? I want to do something but I don't want to tell my family without being abit more sure because they might think I'm overreacting or just being a moody teen, thanks, anything would help xx
