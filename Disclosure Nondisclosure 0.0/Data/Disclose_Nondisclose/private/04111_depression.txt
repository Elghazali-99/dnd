Hello, I have been dealing with severe depression, possible bioplar, anxiety, etc. for the past 6 years now. A couple years into my illness and right after graduating college, I was placed on disability. I am in my early 30's, and carry around a huge amount of guilt and shame. I've worked since  I was 16 and sometimes worked while going to school. I went to college to make a better life for myself, only to end up feeling like the biggest loser. I spend almost EVERY day sitting in my garage in isolation. Sometimes just going to the grocery store is too much. I have been married for 9 years, and my husband is supportive, but really doesn't know much about mental illness. He's one of those happy go lucky guys. Lately, I've been isolation myself from him as well, which is out of the norm, since we are so close. I have no friends anymore, lost all interest in everything. I have tried just about every drug out there. I've aslo tried exercise, vitamins, SHOCK TREATMENTS, church, therapy, and been in a hospital for a few days....NOTHING has helped. Sometimes I think about the worst, and feel my only way out is to take my own life. I'm so exhausted, tired of suffereing, and seeing everyone pass my by LIVING thier lives. Sometimes at night before bed, I have bad anxiety attacks just at the thought of waking up the next day reliving everything. I guess my question is: Can anyone else relate, and if so is there anything that you have done that helps?
 Thanks in advance
