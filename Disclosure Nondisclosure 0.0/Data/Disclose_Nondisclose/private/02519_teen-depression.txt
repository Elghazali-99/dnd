I dunno if you can help me, I am from Brazil and not fluent in Englsih.
 I have no soul, I am almost dead, the only difference is that the heart keep beating.
Since the end of high school with 18 I lost my friends, because I was not good in relationship and very shy too.
Now I am 22 years old, I simply don't care with anything, I can not cry even if a near relative die.
I feel exactly and perfectly like a music in my country I'll try to translate, because that music is everything I'm gonna type.
 "Help, I can feel anything  
Not fear, not worm, not fire.  
I'll not be able to cry nor smile  
Help, any soul, even if grieved.  
Give me your grief  
No longer I feel love, nor pain, nor anything.  
Help me, somone give me a heart, that this one doesn't receive the good nor the bad things  
Pleas just a little emotion  
Anything  
Anything to feel  
Must have a thing that serves  
Help me I no longer feel anything"
 Thats it, I have been practicing sports, tried to find jobs, and don't care anymore with having friends (because I'm "dead soul") but I'm open to have it.
The question is I want to recover myself, what should I do and what kind of professional should I search, I tried a psychologist and psychiatrist but they didn't make anything for me and the psycho take me a long time and money.
I don't want the suicide, when I had feelings I wanna die every day now I'm just a vegetable.
 Thanks for your attention.
