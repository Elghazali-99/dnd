Hello I have been married for 8 years, and my wife has continued to become violent in the last 2 years.  It started out with a remote control to the head, and has escalated into punching, kicking, and assualting me with a knife.  I will not hit a woman, so I usually try and run away when she becomes violent.  She also tells me that she is now attracted to women sexually, and that she can see dead people and things that I can't see.  She is very successful in her day job, and does not display any of these behaviours at work.  She also thinks she is better than everyone else, and has these crazy mood swings that can happen in less than 5 minutes.  I never know what kind of mood she is in, and am always trying to please her so she doesn't become angry.  I do all the housework, bills, laundry, cooking, shopping, and everything else it takes to support our home.  I also have a full time job and make good money.  I don't understand why I feel like I can't do anything right anymore, and when she is violent, she makes me feel like it's my fault.  She engages is binge drinking occasionally, and doesn't let me have contact with my friends and family.  She also calls me like 20 times a day, and is always paranoid I am doing something I'm not.  I have never cheated on her, and don't understand why she is like this in the last two years.  I tried to get her into marital counseling but she refuses to go.  I am ready to leave her because I can't live like this anymore.  I also have health problems, and she doesn't care.  I just want to know what is wrong with her.  She is abusive emotionally, and physically, and has done some really weird and dangerous stuff lately like drinking and driving.  I also just caught her puking up her food after binge eating on several occasions.  Any advise I could get on what's wrong with her would really help.  I am desparate for answers.
