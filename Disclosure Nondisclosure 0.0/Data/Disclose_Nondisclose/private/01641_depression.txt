Am 20years old I left my home three years ago I was happy and active and sociable when I was in my country or home am in third year for medical school I was always good at everything or tht is what I thought I don't know but since I come here I couldn't adopt the new environment at first I was saying am new in here so it's ok ,but things got worse I made some friends but I couldn't trust I feel every one near me is hypocrite and the last six months o got disconnected whith people my marks are dropping 
And worse than tht I don't want to go outside and am always sad and I always sleep while am crying I feel so lonely and sometimes even I think about suicide I don't know life seems so hard nothing works no matter how hard I try I can't talk to my family and tell them anything because they have this idea that am perfect and I can do anything my dad pressures when it comes to marks and I lie to him all the time and I don't have any one that I can tell any one 
Accidentally I found this website today hope u can help me cuz am hopeless and I feel so weak in a way tht u can imagine
