Hi, I'm 13. I'm kinda short, and I weigh about 100 pounds. I am kind of popular, and I do have fun at school. But for no reasons, I just feel so depressed when I get home. I'm not gonna lie, we are poor. Lower class, whatever. I have a 27 year old brother, and a 10 year old brother. My dad and mom have had a abusive past, and he's went to jail for hitting my mom, and but he still does it, and my mother even gets him out of jail.. the next day! My dad hurts my mom, it makes me cry so hard, and when she gets pain pills from the doctor, my dad sells them. Why!?! We don't live in a nice neighbor hood, either. 
My dad always pushes me, in public, I'm the overachiever, and he pushes me to hard. I am in advanced classes, all A's. I do three spots, I'm in FCA, NJHS, and a misget. I tell my parents what they want to hear, I have friends at school, but I'm always just.. lost. Like im in a daze, and I have nothing to do with my life. When I back talk, I'm afraid my dad will slap me next, those, oh-my-god, im-gonna-be-on-the-floor-like-my-mom-was feeling. 
I know what your thinking, "uh, tell the police?" well, thats the whole point, They. Dont. Care. He's already been in jail for a year, my mom continued on with a marriage, even if they hate each other, and live together. 
So, anyways, I cut. I cut my wrist, and I don't regret it. It really helps, it helps SO much, I don't want to die, don't get the wrong idea, I have to protect my brother, I couldn't leave him alone, Brad (27 year old) already moved out (half-bro anyways) But still, I do cut. I have for a while now. I go to school, the happy girl with a smile, a boyfriend, friends, good grades and sports, but behind that, I live.. this. I really don't see anything worth living for except my brother, whos just innocent. He knows whats going on, hes seen everything, yet he acts like its normal. 
I dont want my brother to grow up like that.
Just, tell me what to do. Please, please, please. Tell me what to do. I'm begging you.
