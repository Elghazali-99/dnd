My daughter is 21.  She became Bi-Polar Schizoaffective two years ago at age 19.  
 She is taking:
 Lithium 300 mg 3 x daily
Depacote  500 mg 2 x daily
Lamictal 50 mg. 2 x daily
Zyprexa 10 mg. 2 x daily.
 The Zprexa and extra dose of Lithium was added 30 days ago when she had a bipolar/schizo relapse.
 All it did was turn her into a catatonic/zombie who heard voices.  She has had to drop out of school and quit her job because she is not getting better.  
  She shakes terribly and sweats.  I don't know what to do.  Her psychiatrist is lost.  Instead of changing her meds again....he feels I should take her to the local psychiatric emergency...let her keep her there for a few days until they find the right combination of drugs to give her.
 That place is very traumatic for her...i don't want her to go back.  Not sure what my next step should be.
 She is a brilliant girl with no way to relax her mind without knocking her out.  Her meds were working for such a long time.  My daughter has not been herself in over 30 days.  My heart breaks for her and I feel helpless.
 Do you know what my next step should be.  I don't want her getting into drinking or Marijuana to self medicate herself.  I think she is considering that.
 Thank you for any advice you may have.
 Sincerely, 
 Sally
