Well I'm now on this roller coaster again.. Ugh I'm soo stressed out I have anxiety chest and back pain I'm living in fear.. I been through a lot of pain the last few years. My wife recently left me and I don't get to see my son like a should be able to. I live alone, I keep thinking its the end of the world..I been indulging in drugs to self medicate.. I used a random girl the other day I used protection and I already explained it all in a different post and was told I wasn't at risk for HIV but my messed up mind doesn't let me free.. So now I gotta go get tested and my mind races... I'm the type of person who beats themself up over mistakes and I feel I need to be punished and Its painful to live this way.. So now I'm gotta go get tested, and I'm not sure if it will even ease my mind because I'm soo afraid. I can barely function.. I used to be on lexapro and syriquil but I didnt feel any difference other then feeling sluggish and irritated and gained weight... I feel lost is this normal what should I do?
