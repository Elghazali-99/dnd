I'm currently taking 150mg of Lamictal, daily, as a mood stablizer.  I was diagnosed Bipolar last year but my psychiatrist has always said she doesn't think I really am Bipolar she's just treating me for it.  I guess the lable doesnt really matter since there is no doubt that I am suffering from major depression.  The medication has been helpful but I am noticing that it is not as effective as it was when I first started taking it.  I'm sure I need an increase but I lost my private insurance a few months ago and can't get in to see a medicaid doctor for 3 more months.  My PCP has been writing my prescription for me but will not increase my dose since she is not the original prescriber.   I've been thinking about taking St John's Wort, to help boost my mood, but have read that it may not react well with Lamictal.  I'm wondering if anyone has taken St John's Wort while on Lamictal and if there were any reactions.  Any advise would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you :-),  BTW, I also take 1mg of Klonopin on occasion for night time anxiety.
