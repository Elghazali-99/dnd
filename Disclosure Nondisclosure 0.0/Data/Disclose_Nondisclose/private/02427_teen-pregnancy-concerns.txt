I was supposed to have my period a couple weeks ago. On the 4th of this month me and my boyfriend messed around(which was before I was supposed to get my period) but I told him I didnt want to have sex (we didnt have a condom) so he just stayed outside of me. It was dark so im not sure if he ejaculate even anywhere on the bed or on me, im not quite sure on that one. 2 days after that I had light blood on my underwear as if it was the start of my period so I put in a tampon, but then when I go to take it out there was barely anything on it and I usually have really heavy periods.
on the 19th me and my boyfriend had fun again but I have him a hand job so there was for sure semen involved. He was laying down so it got on him. I dont know if he touched it but a while after that we made out and he fingered me.
Apparently the women in my family are known for being really fertile and easy to get pregnant.
I have really protective parents and im not sure how to get a pregnancy test without them knowing.
 Thanks for any of your suggestions and/or help.
