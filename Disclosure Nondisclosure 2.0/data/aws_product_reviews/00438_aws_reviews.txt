This is an awesome product. I had received a Kindle Paperwhite as a Christmas gift, and it has since become an indispensable part of my daily life. The fit and finish of that product is top notch, and so I was eager to see if this one matches the quality I have come to expect from Amazon.Short answer: it does. Everything works perfectly, and I still have trouble believing that they packed this much awesomeness into such a small box. Having had bad experiences with streaming video in the past, I was a little wary about trying this, but I needn't have worried. Browsing menus is fast, the voice search works great, and watching movies is flawless. A nice touch is all of the detailed help videos which are included as the first thing you see after you set up the device.Even setup is easy, fast and fun. Hook it up to the TV, plug it in, enter network password, wait for a short update, and that's it, ready to go.Nice job, big A. Keep this up, and you will force me to buy all of your products.
