This is without a doubt one of the best purchases that I have made on Amazon. below is a breakdown.Pros:Setup up is easyBluetooth Remote works all over the house so I can voice search upstairs and have the video ready to play when I get to itVoice search REALLY DOES WORKRemote and Box are SUPER fastCons:Setup takes a while (even though it is easy)I did not know my voice searches were recorded until I was looking around in my device area on amazon.com/manageyourkindleRemote seems to use a lot of power, I replaced batteries after first month due to slower response time
