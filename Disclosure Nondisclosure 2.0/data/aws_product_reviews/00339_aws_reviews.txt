I really enjoy the Amazon Fire TV. I only have trouble locating all of the Amazon Prime movies and tv shows in one grouping. I wish I could stream only the movies and tv shows that is included with my Prime membership. Otherwise, this device works excellent. The install was a breeze. Glad I purchased it.
