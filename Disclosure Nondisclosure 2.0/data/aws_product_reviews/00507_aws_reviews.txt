I travel for work. More and more, I find myself leaving the Kindle Fire at home and traveling with just an e-ink Kindle. So when I broke my Kindle 3, I decided to replace it with this entry level Kindle (without special offers).What's good:* Smallest, lightest e-ink Kindle available.* Still has the page turn buttons!* Like all the e-ink Kindles, this thing has amazing battery life.What's just OK:* Only 2GB memory. More is better. Then again, after two years of buying books I'm nowhere near filling this thing up.* Text entry using the 5-way switch works, but that's about all. I'm surprised it works well enough that I can't consider it a negative.What's not so good:* The lighted cover costs nearly as much as the Kindle! Anyone thinking of picking up this Kindle and the lighted cover should look at the new paper white models with integrated frontlight.The new Kindles look awesome. But they don't take anything away from this Kindle. It may not have some of the bells and whistles of the other models but it also costs quite a bit less. The Kindle is exactly what I need for traveling. It works wonderfully as a basic, no-frills e-reader. Reviewing it as such, I have to give it five stars.
