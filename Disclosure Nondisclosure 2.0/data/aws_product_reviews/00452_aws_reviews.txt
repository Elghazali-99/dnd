I've been planning on getting a set top box for the past 2 years but just never found something that had everything I was looking for. Briefly browsing amazon a couple of weeks ago, I noticed they had their own recently release online media streaming device. After looking over the specs and capabilities, I thought it was about time to take the plunge - especially since we've been using Amazon Prime streaming services more and more now that our daughter watches kid shows (i.e. Dora, Umi Zumi, Blues Clues, etc.)Though we've only had it around a week, we're very happy with the purchase. We cut our cable over a year ago so plugging in the computer to the TV every time we wanted to watch something was beginning to get tiresome. Connection was straightforward and simple. On boot, it was automatically logged into our Prime account (not sure how it did this.)The interface is slick and really easy to find what you're looking for. It's very quick (not clunky) when browsing through video options and for some reason I think it looks better (could be mental, I know.) Another neat thing is that the remote doesn't have to have line-of-sight to the front of the box since it utilizes bluetooth. It's all about the simple things. Anyways, we're very happy with this little box.
