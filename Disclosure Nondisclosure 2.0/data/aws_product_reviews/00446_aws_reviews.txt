Just spent a few hours with my FireTV, and am quite impressed. Setup is incredibly easy, the voice commands work amazingly well, and everything loads quickly. The lack of storage is a major issue if you are planning on using it for gaming. Only 5.6 GB's of space is usable, which can be filled quite quickly by games that push past 1GB a piece.On the plus side wired xbox 360 controllers workAlso, this would be a great device for someone who is not tech savvy. There is a really nice instructional animation that loads the first time you power on the device, and the voice commands make finding content VERY easy.For parents: There are parental controls, and an option to block all in-app purchases. This is a godsend if you have kids.EDIT: There are dozens of reviews from people who don't even have a FireTV. Look for the verified purchase logo on reviews. If it doesn't appear ignore that review as they don't have any experience with the device.
