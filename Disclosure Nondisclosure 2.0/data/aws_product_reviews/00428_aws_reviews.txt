We ditched cable two years ago and live on Netflix and Amazon Prime. The Fire TV is for our second TV. It setup fast, though I was disappointed that it spent five minutes updating initially. The intro was fast, professional and showed the basic features.We currently use a Sony Blu Ray Player for our primary TV. The Fire TV is much faster to key through screens and items. The antenna for the wifi is superior, connecting our upstairs TV to the downstairs wireless router. The Fire TV starts streaming content instantly, no boot up time.We are very happy to add this streaming device to our home.
