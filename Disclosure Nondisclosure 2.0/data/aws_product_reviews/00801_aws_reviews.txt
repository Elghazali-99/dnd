I have yet to discover all the things this can do. I consider myself a hip almost-50 year old, and have used computers most of my adult life...I waited and researched and finally decided on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 and the Samsung Galaxy smartphone - very happy with both. I'm still having a hard time making the digital leap to downloading books and newspapers. I love reading and listening to music, but still like to hold and smell the pages of the real thing. I can see how fantastic it is while commuting or traveling to have my reading material available in one neat place, on the Kindle..it's just going to take some time. I dumping cable and it was really nice to watch just what I want to watch - it was easy to download Mad Men on the Kindle, and watch when it was convenient. I do have a concern as to what happens when someday, the tablet goes berserk or extinct - do we lose the books and movies downloaded on the Kindle I do not use it to play video games, but the display and picture is very sharp. One aggravating problem I'm having is that Amazon is downloading games and things that I did NOT authorize. Some are free and some show prices with confirmation numbers - I don't appreciate Amazon deciding to download a bunch of crap I don't want and will never use, without my permission - so that is an issue I am trying to address. Otherwise, it's compact enough to fit in most handbags and it's been most useful in meetings and study groups - way nicer than lugging around a laptop (listen to one who had to use a typewriter in college). We've come a long way. I also ordered a reasonably priced Finite folio case/cover from Amazon that works great and allows it to stand.
