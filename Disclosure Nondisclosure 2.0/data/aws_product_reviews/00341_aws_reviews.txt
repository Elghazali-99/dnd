I ordered this as soon as it was available and it arrived this morning. For background, I also have an Apple TV, which I hate but my kids love. I also have various WDTV models, Which I love. The reason the kids love the Apple TV is that the interface is so slick and quick, which the WDTV certainly lacks in. This Fire TV is even better IMO than the Apple TV and the WDTV doesn't even come close. Unfortunately, the Fire TV misses in a huge way for me by not allowing the play of external content through the USB port from attached storage or memory stick. If it had that capability, and hopefully it will in the future This would be the perfect device. This is why I am still hanging on to my WDTV as my go to player. It will play virtually any file format you throw at it which is a priority to me. I have been reading about the Plex app and that may satisfy my needs as well, but I haven't dug deeper or tested it out. If that is not the case for you, than the Fire TV would be a great option. I am not familiar with Roku, because I could never justify the purchase due to the inability to play content from local storage. Unfortunately I jumped the gun with the Fire TV because I saw that it did have a USB port and made the assumption it would support external content. Hopefully this will come in a future firmware release otherwise maybe Plex will be able to fill that gap for me. Bottom line, if external content is not important, I would recommend this Fire TV due to the availability of Prime content and the fact the interface is beautiful and very quick. The Apple TV should only be a consideration over this if you are a fanatic Apple loyalist, or you have a tremendous amount of itunes content you want to be able to utilize.
