I received my Fire TV today, I am surprised, amazed, thrilled and extremely pleased it's all that and a bag of chips The ease of use is so simple, hookup is a breeze, I had it hooked up and running with in 3 minutes The remote is small so what, My only con is: the voice search should be for everything. To own this and not have Amazon Prime should be a crime, LOL, it's a must for the Fire TV. I gave up Direct TV in January, I was paying to much for what I was getting. With the Fire TV it's customized tv at your finger tips, no more paying for channels you don't need and no more cable bill I hope more people are waking up and ditching pay tv. I pay 7.99 for Netflix, I watch Crackle for free, no more commercials, no more unwanted/un needed channels, movies when I want, sit-coms when I want. no more running to 'pick up' a dvd, I'm telling ya streaming is where it's at and this device is a must Life is hard, this is easy.
