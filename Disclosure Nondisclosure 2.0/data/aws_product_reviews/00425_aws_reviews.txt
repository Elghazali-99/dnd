Easy to set up literally plug it in, download the apps wanted, and go. No software installation. No issues-so far. Incredibly user friendly interface. The only thing I am slightly pissed about is the fact that my signature/someone answering the door wasn't required when the package was delivered, a 100 piece of equipment was just left on my doorstep. Other than that, I'm quite happy with it
