I like the box but I'm on a wired network and overnight it looses the connection so the next day I have to unplug the Fire TV box and let it reboot to find the network again. I called customer service and they said they would look into it and get back - well, they never got back to me and it has been over two weeks. I like it when it works but I hate having to reboot the thing every time I want to watch it.
