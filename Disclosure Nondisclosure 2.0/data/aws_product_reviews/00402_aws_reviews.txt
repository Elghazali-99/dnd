I love this thing, its what I have been looking for in entertainment, its very fast and does gaming well but Amazon slipped up when they only gave this gem 8 gigs of storage space. This is a game changer for sure but it needs at the very least 128 gigs to fully enjoy Fire TV. Would have loved to give Fire TV 5 stars but 8 gigs is being cheap considering that most game titles are now 50 - 300 megs each.oh and one more thing, it needs googles play store so us Android users can use our paid games on this machine as well.
