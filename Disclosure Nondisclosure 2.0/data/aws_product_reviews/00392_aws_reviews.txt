Amazon Fire is misleading. I recommend staying with an Apple TV. The device is very fast and the instant play is one of a kind. The voice search is unmatched by anything on the market. The only problem with the voice search and instant play is it only works for Amazon Prime videos. That is a disclaimer that should be noted somewhere. At least in small print.
