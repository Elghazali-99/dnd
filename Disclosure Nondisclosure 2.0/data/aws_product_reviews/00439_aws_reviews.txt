STICK WITH ROKU, SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE. I WISH I COULD SEND THE FIRE TV BACK. TO OPERATE THE FIRE TV IS JUST A UNNECESSARY MESS. EVEN THE MIC COULD NOT FIND A PROGRAM ON FIRE TV (NETFLIX) THAT IS ON ROKU (NETFLIX). TO ME, I DON'T NEED ALL THE BS TO WATCH A PROGRAM .I'LL GET ANOTHER ROKU AND BE HAPPY.
