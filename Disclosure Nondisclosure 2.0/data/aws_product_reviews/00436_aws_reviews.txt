Oddly this device deserves both a five star rating and a 1 star rating at the same time. The things they did right, they did really, really right and blow the competition out of the water but there are serious omissions that I believe an average television watcher is going to surely miss.For watching Amazon content this device is glorious smooth, extremely fast, easy and convenient. The performance is truly impressive and definitely best in class. The voice search worked great for me although I am not pushing it to its limits with a medium range voice and no accent. I love how it was already linked to my account since I purchased it from Amazon, classy touch.Major omissions/annoyances: The remote will not control your TV, so for turning the TV on/off and adjusting volume you will still need another remote.Other content providers (Netflix, Pandora, etc) are not integrated with voice search, so your voice search will only call up Amazon content and to access the others you have to enter into the app explicitly and use an on-screen hunt-and-peck style interface to search. I am hopeful that either the content providers will remedy this in the future or Amazon will sell a bluetooth keyboard for the thing. Perhaps just make my GoogleTV keyboard work :)Also, it does not come with an hdmi cable. Most people probably already have a cable they can use, but I can only imagine the frustration of someone purchasing this and not having the ability to plug it in. This device in its current state will not really replace other devices you have, it would most likely just be an added item for watching Amazon content, so a cable should have been included.Obviously, this is a first impression review (The Fire TV was released yesterday). Some of my first annoyances could be remedied by a future software update, but I don't recommend you buy this product just yet. I am going to keep mine a few days to explore further and then probably send it back. I will update this review.
