I collect these streaming boxes, anything from Google Chromecast to Dlink Boxee Box, Boxee TV etc. This Amazon Fire TV has been my go to device since it arrived.The menu could use some work, but it's most likely because I'm used to Apple TV and my iOS environment.The responsiveness is top notch. My favorite feature is the voice control, built right into the remote.I would only ask for one additional feature, the ability to plug headphones into the remote and listen silently.
