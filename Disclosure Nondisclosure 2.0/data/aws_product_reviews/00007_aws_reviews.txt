Just got mine right now. Looks the same as the previous generation except for the Kindle logo (it's black this time), feels a little heavier, the screen is a little warmer toned than the previous one, BUT the resolution is SO MUCH BETTER! The 300 ppi are definitely obvious and the new font is worth the money.Totally recommend it for a book lover!I'll give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I am used to a cooler screen, but I'm sure I'll get used to this one soon too :)
