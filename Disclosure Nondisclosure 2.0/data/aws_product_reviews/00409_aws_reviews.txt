We live in an RV and we get internet through our phones Hotspot or from free WiFi in RV Parks. Fire TV is sometimes the only way to pick up the TV Shows we have missed. I have not been able to find CBN or The Blaze TV on the device. Those and two of my favorites that I used to watch on the Roku device that I miss.
