Having bought 2 of the Roku 3 and I am a little spoiled. The Fire has very few or limited, outdated apps. (Mostly Amazon Apps) No HBO Go, No PBS, No TargetTicket, Showtime Anytime is out of date, (Does not list DirecTV as provider) No VUDU It does have Flixster but it loads very slow. The USB port is useless Why is even there What a let down Sending mine back Not worth 99
