I recently received my Amazon Fire TV after months of researching which streaming device would be the best. Basically what you are paying for is the internal specs, which Amazon has every other device beat by far. The software limitations I am confident will be resolved soon, like HBOGo and Amazon MP3 apps being added. We got this device to replace cable/dish. With subscriptions to Netflix DVDs, Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus, there is very little we are missing by streaming and much we are saving The folks complaining about Hulu stopping in the middle of programming, I have had this happen here and there, but it has been at peak Internet use times only. During the day, when folks are at work, I have had 0 problems streaming. Just make sure you have good, high speed internet and a cable modem router that can fully support the number of devices being used at one time. I am totally happy with our purchase of the Amazon FireTV
