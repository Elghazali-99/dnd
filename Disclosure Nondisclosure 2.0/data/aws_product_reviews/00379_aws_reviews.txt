My Amazon Prime movies come in crystal clear and fast.The Voice Search really WORKS very wellMy Netflix resolution is excellent, much better than what the Netflix app on my LG flatscreen TV delivers.The Plex app delivers excellent video (I haven't tried the music yet).Having used this for a little over a week now my next step is to buy two more for each TV in the house and give away my Apple TV. It simply does everything so much better.Most Satisfied Highly recommendI will post an update if I have anything further to add but I will say this: Go get One - Really Worth The Price
