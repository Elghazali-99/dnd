Bear with me while I do amazon's work for them and copy from the Lakewood website:<br />---------------------------------------<br />Nutrition Facts<br />32oz UPC 042608460503<br /><br />Serving Size 8 oz<br />Serving Size 240 ml<br />Amount Per Serving<br />Calories 125  Calories from Fat 25<br />% Daily Value*<br />Total Fat 3.5g  6%<br />Saturated Fat 0.5g  4%<br />Trans Fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 0mg  0%<br />Potassium 370mg  10%<br />Sodium 25mg  1%<br />Total Carbohydrate 28g  9%<br />Dietary Fiber 4g  16%<br />Sugars 21g<br />Protein 2g<br /><br />Omega 3 40mg, Omega 6 600mg, Omega 9 2400mg, Vitamin A 20%, Vitamin C 100%, Calcium 6%, Iron 8%, Vitamin E 6%, Vitamin B1 (Thiamin) 6%, Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) 4%, Niacin 6%, Vitamin B6 8%, Folate 8%, Magnesium 8%, Zinc 2%, Phosphorous 4%, Vitamin K 15%,<br />*Percent Daily values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Certified Organic Juice Blend (Organic Acai, Organic Apple, Organic Concord Grape, Organic Grape, Organic Pomegranate, Organic Blackberry, Organic Blueberry, Organic Red Tart Cherry, And Organic Acerola Cherry From Concentrate); Organic Goji Berry, Natural Fiber (Organic Guar, Xanthan, Carrageenan, Sodium Alginate And Organic Locust Bean), And Organic Rose Hip.<br /><br />Gluten FREE* Casein FREE GMO FREE*<br />100% Fruit Juices are Gluten-Free<br />---------------------------------------<br /><br />This is an excellent Lakewood juice- they call it juice but it's as thick as an Odwalla drink like a smoothie. With all that's in it, this is a very good value. Considering you can pay as much for any one of the ingredients in it. My personal use is to add this to kombucha, maximizing it's longevity that way, I've tried many but this one is the best for kombucha. They say an 8oz glass has 2 servings of fruit on the Lakewood website. It's quite tasty in that it's not too sweet, very thick textured even with the tiny bits of seed in it reminiscent of a banana smoothie. The ingredient list is somewhat confusing but note that only the Acerola Cherry is from concentrate, everything else is fresh pressed. Acai is very high on the ORAC scale of anti-oxidants, Rose Hips are also very high, everything else is in the mid to high range of fruit. Pomegranate has many beneficial properties beyond just anti-oxidants as well, it's a noteworthy fighter of heart disease and Alzheimer's type dementia. Considering the price of Goji berries I really like their inclusion in this drink, albeit at a lesser level.<br /><br />BTW: Amazon had only 1 day wait before shipping.
