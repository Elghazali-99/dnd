As an Oregonian, I make a point of sharing these Oregon-made snacks with friends who visit the state. I tell them the Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrew does for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with Spicy Thai chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."<br /><br />I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a>.<br /><br />The Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing. The Honey Dijon chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are a perfect complement to vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />In summary, I highly recommend Kettle Brand chips, a great buy on Amazon.com.
