I tired many different dog foods over the 3 yrs I have my cocker spaniel. I then came upon this breed specific dog food & figured I'd try it. My dog loves this food and always finishes his food. I've used this for over 1 yr now & he has not tired of it. I have seen a significant change (for the better) in him, he's more active and doing well.<br /><br />I only buy this brand food for him now.<br /><br />Buster gives it 2 paws up & I give it 5 stars.
