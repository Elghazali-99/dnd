A watered down perversion of the acai berry.<br /><br />This juice comes on strong and harsh.  With tart aftertaste and no texture.<br /><br />That's because it is mostly apple juice, grape juice, pomegranate juice, blackberry juice, blueberry juice, and tart cherry juice.  Oh yeah there is some acai berry juice mixed into this concoction.<br /><br />You shall not find that distinctive  smooth chocolaty acai flavor here.  There is no milky mouth pleasing texture neither.  For that exotic unique acai experience try Zola or Samzon  brands.<br /><br />I'm not saying that this Lakewood juice product isn't nutritious.  That's not my point.  I'm saying that it's a juice blend that does not taste anything like the real acai juice.
