<p>We're working on an application that displays information through a Direct3D visualisation. A late client request is the ability to view this application via some Remote Desktop solution.</p>

<p>Has anyone done anything similar? What options are available / unavailable? I'm thinking RDC, VNC, Citrix...</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>
