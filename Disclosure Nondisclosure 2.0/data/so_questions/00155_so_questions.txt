<p>I don't know when to add to a dataset a tableadapter or a query from toolbox. Does it make any difference?</p>

<p>I also dont know where to create instances of the adapters. </p>

<ul>
<li>Should I do it in the <code>Page_Load</code>? </li>
<li>Should I just do it when I'm going to use it?  </li>
<li>Am I opening a new connection when I create a new instance?</li>
</ul>

<p>This doesn't seem very important, but every time I create a query a little voice on my brain asks me these questions.</p>
