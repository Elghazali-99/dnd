<p>After attending a recent Alt.NET group on IoC, I got to thinking about the tools available and how they might work.  <code>StructureMap</code> in particular uses both attributes and bootstrapper concepts to map requests for <code>IThing</code> to <code>ConcreteThing</code>.  Attributes automatically throw up flags for me that either reflection or IL injection is going on.  Does anyone know exactly how this works (for <code>StructureMap</code> or other IoC tools) and what the associated overhead might be either at run-time or compile-time?</p>
