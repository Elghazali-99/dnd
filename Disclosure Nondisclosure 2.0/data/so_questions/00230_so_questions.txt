<p>I have a listening port on my server that I'm connecting to using a Java class and the <code>Socket</code> interface, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>Socket mySocket = new Socket(host,port);
</code></pre>

<p>I then grab an <code>OutputStream</code>, decorate with a <code>PrintWriter</code> in autoflush mode and I'm laughing - except if the listening port closes. Then I get </p>

<pre><code>tcp4       0      0  *.9999                 *.*                    LISTEN
tcp        0      0  127.0.0.1.45737        127.0.0.1.9999         CLOSE_WAIT
</code></pre>

<p>and I can't seem to detect the problem in the program - I've tried using the <code>isConnected()</code> method on the socket but it doesn't seem to know that the connection is closed.</p>

<p>I want to be aware of the problem the next time I try and write to the Socket so that I can try and reconnect and report the issue.</p>

<p>Any advice please?</p>

<p>Thanks all</p>
