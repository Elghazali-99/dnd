<p>I'm integrating .NET support into our C++ application.<br />
It's an old-school MFC application, with 1 extra file compiled with the "/clr" option that references a CWinFormsControl.</p>

<p>I'm not allowed to remove the linker flag "/NODEFAULTLIB".<br />
(We have our own build management system, not Visual Studio's.)<br />
This means I have to specify all necessary libraries: VC runtime and MFC.</p>

<p>Other compiler options include "/MD"</p>

<p>Next to that: I can't use the linker flag "/FORCE:MULTIPLE" and just add <em>everything</em>:<br />
I'm looking for a non-overlapping set of libraries.</p>
