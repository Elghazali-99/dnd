<p>I have three tables: page, attachment, page-attachment</p>

<p>I have data like this:</p>

<pre><code>page
ID    NAME
1     first page
2     second page
3     third page
4     fourth page

attachment
ID    NAME
1     foo.word
2     test.xsl
3     mm.ppt

page-attachment
ID    PAGE-ID   ATTACHMENT-ID
1     2         1
2     2         2
3     3         3
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to get the number of attachments per page <strong>also when that number is 0</strong>. I have tried with: </p>

<pre><code>select page.name, count(page-attachment.id) as attachmentsnumber 
from page 
    inner join page-attachment on page.id=page-id 
group by page.id
</code></pre>

<p>I am getting this output: </p>

<pre><code>NAME        ATTACHMENTSNUMBER
second page  2
third page   1
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to get this output:</p>

<pre><code>NAME        ATTACHMENTSNUMBER
first page   0
second page  2
third page   1
fourth page  0
</code></pre>

<p>How do I get the 0 part?</p>
