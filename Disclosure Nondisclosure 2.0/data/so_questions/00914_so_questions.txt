<p>Can anyone recommend an efficient method to execute XSLT transforms of XML data within a Ruby application? The XSL gem (REXSL) is not available yet, and while I have seen a project or two that implement it, I'm wary of using them so early on. A friend had recommended a shell out call to Perl, but I'm worried about resources. </p>
