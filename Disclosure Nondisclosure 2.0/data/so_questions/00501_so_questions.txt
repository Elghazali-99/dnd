<p>What's the best way to implement a SQL script that will grant select, references, insert, update, and delete permissions to a database role on all the user tables in a database?</p>

<p>Ideally, this script could be run multiple times, as new tables were added to the database. SQL Server Management Studio generates scripts for individual database objects, but I'm looking for more of a "fire-and-forget" script.</p>
