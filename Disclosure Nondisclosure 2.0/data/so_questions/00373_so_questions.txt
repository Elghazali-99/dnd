<p>I have only just started received the following error in my windows forms application under dot net 2 framework on windows 2000 when using System.DirectoryServices.</p>

<pre><code>    {System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException}

<p>at System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry.Bind()
   at System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry.get_AdsObject()
   at System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher.FindAll(Boolean findMoreThanOne)
   at System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher.FindAll()</p>

<p>I have re-installed the framework and re-registered activeds.dll however this has not resolved the issue. I am guessing I need to find another dll and re-register it however it is not clear which dll this would be.</p>
