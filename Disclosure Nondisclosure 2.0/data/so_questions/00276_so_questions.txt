<p>I have an Excel Spreadsheet like this</p>

<pre>
id | data for id
   | more data for id
id | data for id
id | data for id
   | more data for id
   | even more data for id
id | data for id
   | more data for id
id | data for id
id | data for id
   | more data for id
</pre>

<p>Now I want to group the data of one id by alternating the background color of the rows</p>

<pre>
var color = white
for each row
    if the first cell is not empty and color is white
        set color to green
    if the first cell is not empty and color is green
        set color to white
    set background of row to color
</pre>

<p>Can anyone help me with a macro or some VBA code</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
