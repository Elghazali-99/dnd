<p>With this code I can show an animated gif while the server script is running:</p>

<pre><code>function calculateTotals() {
    $('#results').load('getResults.php', null, showStatusFinished);
    showLoadStatus();
}

function showLoadStatus() {
    $('#status').html('');
}


function showStatusFinished() {
    $('#status').html('Finished.');
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, I would like to display a status of how far along the script is, e.g. "Processing line 342 of 20000..." and have it count up until it is finished.</p>

<p>How can I do that? I can make a server-script which constantly contains the updated information but where do I put the command to read this, say, every second?</p>
