<p>On a PHP-based web site, I want to send users a download package after they have filled out a short form. The site-initiated download should be similar to sites like download.com, which say "your download will begin in a moment."</p>

<p>A couple of <strong>possible approaches</strong> I know about, and browser compatibility (based on a quick test):</p>

<p><strong>1) Do a <code>window.open</code> pointing to the new file.</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>- FireFox 3 blocks this.  
 - IE6 blocks this.  
 - IE7 blocks this.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2) Create an iframe pointing to the new file.</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>- FireFox 3 seems to think this is OK. (Maybe it's because I already accepted it once?)  
 - IE6 blocks this.  
 - IE7 blocks this.

How can I do this so that at least these three browsers will not object? 
</code></pre>

<p>Bonus: is there a method that doesn't require browser-conditional statements? </p>

<p>(I believe that download.com employs both methods conditionally, but I can't get either one to work.)</p>

<p><strong>Responses and Clarifications:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Q: "Why not point the current window to the file?"  
A: That might work, but in this particular case, I want to show them some other content while their download starts - for example, "would you like to donate to this project?"
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE: I have abandoned this approach. See my answer below for reasons.</strong></p>
