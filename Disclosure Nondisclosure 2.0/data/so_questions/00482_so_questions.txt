<p>I would like to compare the contents of a couple of collections in my Equals method.  I have a Dictionary and an IList.  Is there a built-in method to do this?</p>

<p>Edited:
I want to compare two Dictionaries and two ILists, so I think what equality means is clear - if the two dictionaries contain the same keys mapped to the same values, then they're equal.</p>
