<p>I have a UserControl in my Asp.net project that has a public property. I do not want this property to show up in the Visual Studio Property Window when a user highlights an instance of the UserControl in the IDE. What attribute (or other method) should I use to prevent it from showing up?</p>

<pre><code>class MyControl : System.Web.UI.UserControl {
  // Attribute to prevent property from showing in VS Property Window?
  public bool SampleProperty { get; set; }

  // other stuff
}
</code></pre>
