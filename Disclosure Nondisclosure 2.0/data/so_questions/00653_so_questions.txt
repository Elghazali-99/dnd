<p>Slashdot has a little widget that allows you to tweak your comment threshold to filter out down-modded comments.  It will be in one place if you scroll to the top of the page, and as you scroll down, at some point, where its original home is about to scroll off the page, it will switch to fixed position, and stay on your screen.  (To see an example, click <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/news/08/09/10/2257242.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)</p>

<p>My question is, how can I accomplish the same effect of having a menu be in one place when scrolled up, and switch to fixed position as the user scrolls down?  I know this will involve a combination of CSS and javascript.  I'm not necessarily looking for a full example of working code, but what steps will my code need to go through?</p>
