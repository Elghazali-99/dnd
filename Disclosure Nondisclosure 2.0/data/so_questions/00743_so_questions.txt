<p>There is a lot of information out there on object-relational mappers and how to best avoid impedance mismatch, all of which seem to be moot points if one were to use an object database.  My question is why isn't this used more frequently?  Is it because of performance reasons or because object databases cause your data to become proprietary to your application or is it due to something else?  </p>
