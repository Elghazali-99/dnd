<p>I've to admin a small website for my alumni group which is hosted by my ISV. The url is something like www.myIsv.com/myWebSite/ which is quite ugly and very forgetable. The main admin of the webserver has registered a domain name www.mysmallwebsite.com and put a index.html with this content:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;www.mysmallwebsite.com&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;frameset&gt;
   &lt;frame src="http://www.myIsv.com/myWebSite/" name="redir"&gt;
      &lt;noframes&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Original location:
          &lt;a href="www.myIsv.com/myWebSite/"&gt;http://www.myIsv.com/myWebSite/&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/noframes&gt;
 &lt;/frameset&gt;  
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It works fine, but some features like PHP Session variables doesn't work anymore! Anyone has a suggestion for correcting that?</p>

<p>Edit:
This doesn't work both on IE and on Firefox (no plugins)</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
