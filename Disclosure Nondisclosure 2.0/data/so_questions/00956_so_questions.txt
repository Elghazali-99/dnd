<p>I have a code snippet written in PHP that pulls a block of text from a database and sends it out to a widget on a webpage.  The original block of text can be a lengthy article or a short sentence or two; but for this widget I can't display more than, say, 200 characters.  I could use substr() to chop off the text at 200 chars, but the result would be cutting off in the middle of words-- what I really want is to chop the text at the end of the last <i>word</i> before 200 chars.</p>
