<p>I'd like to make a debug logging function with the same parameters as <code>printf</code>.  But one that can be removed by the pre-processor during optimized builds.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>Debug_Print("Warning: value %d &gt; 3!\n", value);
</code></pre>

<p>I've looked at variadic macros but those aren't available on all platforms. <code>gcc</code> supports them, <code>msvc</code> does not.</p>
