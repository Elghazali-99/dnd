<p>I came across a printed <a href="http://www.eiffel.com/general/column/2008/02.html" rel="nofollow">article by Bertrand Meyer</a> where he states that tests can be generated from specifications. My development team does nothing like this, but it sounds like a good technique to consider. How are you generating tests from specifications? How would you describe the success your having in discovering program faults via this method?</p>
