<p>I'm using Mono with GTK# and am trying to display an existing window as a new tab in a GTK.Notebook.  I'm currently re-parenting the widget to the notebook as follows:</p>

<pre>
MyWindow myWindow = new MyWindow();
myWindow.Children[0].Reparent(myNotebook)
</pre>

<p>Should I be doing this, or is there a better way to re-use an existing window so that you can display it on a tab?</p>
