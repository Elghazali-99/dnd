<p>my school maths are very rusty and I think this is a good opportunity to take advance of this community :D</p>

<p>I have two points (a line) and a rectangle, I would like to know how to calculate if the line intersects the rectangle, my first approach had so many "if" statements that the compiler sent me a link to this site.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time!</p>
