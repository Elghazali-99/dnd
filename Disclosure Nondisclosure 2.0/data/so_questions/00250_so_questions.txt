<p>I started using IRC at a young age, and I have always been fascinated with it.  As a language exercise, I was thinking about programming a simple IRC client in Ruby with <a href="http://www.shoooes.net/">Shoes</a> as a graphical front-end.  My question to you, kind-sirs, what do I need to become familiar with to start on this great adventure (besides shoes and Ruby of course)?  I imagine there is some-sort of specification on IRC Protocol.  Any pointers?</p>
