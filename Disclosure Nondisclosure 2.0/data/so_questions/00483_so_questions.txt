<p>Let's say you want to save a bunch of files somewhere, for instance in BLOBs. Let's say you want to dish these files out via a web page and have the client automatically open the correct application/viewer.</p>

<p>Assumption: The browser figures out which application/viewer to use by the mime-type (content-type?) header in the HTTP response.</p>

<p>Based on that assumption, in addition to the bytes of the file, you also want to save the MIME type.</p>

<p>How would you find the MIME type of a file? I'm currently on a Mac, but this should also work on Windows. </p>

<p>Does the browser add this information when posting the file to the web page?</p>

<p>Is there a neat python library for finding this information? A WebService or (even better) a downloadable database?</p>
