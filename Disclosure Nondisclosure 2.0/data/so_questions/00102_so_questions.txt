<p>I've been playing around with the ASP.NET MVC Framework and the one thing that's really confusing me is how I'm meant to do server side validation of posted form data.  I presume I don't post back to the same URL, but if I don't, how do I redisplay the form with the entered data and error messages?  Also, where should the validation logic go?  In the model or the controller?  This seems to be one of the few areas where web forms are much stronger (I miss the validation controls).</p>
