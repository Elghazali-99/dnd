<p>I've developed my own delivery extension for Reporting Services 2005, to integrate this with our SaaS marketing solution.</p>

<p>It takes the subscription, and takes a snapshot of the report with a custom set of parameters. It then renders the report, sends an e-mail with a link and the report attached as XLS.</p>

<p>Everything works fine, until mail delivery...</p>

<p>Here's my code for sending e-mail:</p>

<pre><code> public static List&lt;string&gt; SendMail(SubscriptionData data, Stream reportStream, string reportName, string smptServerHostname, int smtpServerPort)
{
  List&lt;string&gt; failedRecipients = new List&lt;string&gt;();

  MailMessage emailMessage = new MailMessage(data.ReplyTo, data.To);
  emailMessage.Priority = data.Priority;
  emailMessage.Subject = data.Subject;
  emailMessage.IsBodyHtml = false;
  emailMessage.Body = data.Comment;

  if (reportStream != null)
  {
    Attachment reportAttachment = new Attachment(reportStream, reportName);
    emailMessage.Attachments.Add(reportAttachment);
    reportStream.Dispose();
  }

  try
  {
    SmtpClient smtp = new SmtpClient(smptServerHostname, smtpServerPort);

    // Send the MailMessage
    smtp.Send(emailMessage);
  }
  catch (SmtpFailedRecipientsException ex)
  {
    // Delivery failed for the recipient. Add the e-mail address to the failedRecipients List
    failedRecipients.Add(ex.FailedRecipient);
  }
  catch (SmtpFailedRecipientException ex)
  {
    // Delivery failed for the recipient. Add the e-mail address to the failedRecipients List
    failedRecipients.Add(ex.FailedRecipient);
  }
  catch (SmtpException ex)
  {
    throw ex;
  }
  catch (Exception ex)
  {
    throw ex;
  }

  // Return the List of failed recipient e-mail addresses, so the client can maintain its list.
  return failedRecipients;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Values for SmtpServerHostname is localhost, and port is 25.</p>

<p>I veryfied that I can actually send mail, by using Telnet. And it works.</p>

<p><strong>Here's the error message I get from SSRS:</strong></p>

<p>ReportingServicesService!notification!4!08/28/2008-11:26:17:: Notification 6ab32b8d-296e-47a2-8d96-09e81222985c completed.  Success: False, Status: Exception Message: Failure sending mail.

<p><strong>Could this have something to do with Trust/Code Access Security?</strong></p>

<p>My delivery extension is granted full trust in rssrvpolicy.config:</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;CodeGroup 
    class="UnionCodeGroup"
    version="1"
    PermissionSetName="FullTrust"
    Name="MyDelivery_CodeGroup"
    Description="Code group for MyDelivery extension"&gt;
    &lt;IMembershipCondition class="UrlMembershipCondition" version="1" Url="C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.2\Reporting Services\ReportServer\bin\MyDeliveryExtension.dll" /&gt;
   &lt;/CodeGroup&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Could trust be an issue here?</p>

<p>Another theory: SQL Server and SSRS was installed in the security context of Local System. Am I right, or is this service account restricted access to any network resource? Even its own SMTP Server?</p>

<p>I tried changing all SQL Server Services logons to Administrator - but still without any success.</p>

<p>I also tried logging onto the SMTP server in my code, by proviiding: NetworkCredential("Administrator", "password") and also NetworkCredential("Administrator", "password", "MyRepServer")</p>

<p>Can anyone help here, please?</p>
