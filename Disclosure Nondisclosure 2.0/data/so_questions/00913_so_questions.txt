<p>Does anyone know of a good open source plugin for database querying and exploring within Eclipse? </p>

<p>The active Database Exploring plugin within Eclipse is really geared around being associated with a Java project. While I am just trying to run ad-hoc queries and explore the schema. I am effectively looking for a just a common, quick querying tool without the overhead of having to create a code project. I have found a couple open source database plugins for Eclipse but these have not seen active development in over a year.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>
