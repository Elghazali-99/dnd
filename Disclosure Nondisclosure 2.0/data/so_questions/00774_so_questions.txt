<p>I'd like to be able to see <code>Win32_PhysicalMedia</code> information when logged in as
a <em>Limited User</em> in Windows XP (no admin rights). It works ok when logged in as <em>Admin</em>,
<code>WMIDiag</code> has just given a clean bill of health, and <code>Win32_DiskDrive</code> class
produces information correctly, but <code>Win32_PhysicalMedia</code> produces a count of 0
for this code</p>

<pre><code>set WMI = GetObject("WinMgtmts:/root/cimv2")
set objs = WMI.InstancesOf("Win32_PhysicalMedia")
wscript.echo objs.count
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, if the hard disk serial number as found on the <code>SerialNumber</code>
property of the physical drives is available in another class which I can
read as a limited user please let me know. I am not attempting to write to
any property with WMI, but I can't read this when running as a <em>Limited User</em>.
Interestingly, <code>DiskDrive</code> misses out the <code>Signature</code> property, which would do for
my application when run as a <em>Limited User</em> but is present when run from an
<em>Admin</em> account.</p>
