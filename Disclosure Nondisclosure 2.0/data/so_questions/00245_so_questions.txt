<p>Joe Van Dyk <a href="http://www.zenspider.com/pipermail/ruby/2008-August/004223.html">asked the Ruby mailing list</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi,</p>
  
  <p>In Ruby, I guess you can't marshal a lambda/proc object, right?  Is
  that possible in lisp or other languages?</p>
  
  <p>What I was trying to do:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>l = lamda { ... }
Bj.submit "/path/to/ruby/program", :stdin =&gt; Marshal.dump(l)
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, I'm sending BackgroundJob a lambda object, which contains the
  context/code for what to do.  But, guess that wasn't possible.  I
  ended up marshaling a normal ruby object that contained instructions
  for what to do after the program ran.</p>
