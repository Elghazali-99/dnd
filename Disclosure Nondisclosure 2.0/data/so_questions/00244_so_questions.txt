<p>What is the best method to get objects out of a BlockingQueue, in a concurrent program, without hitting a race condition?  I'm currently doing the following and I'm not convinced it is the best method:</p>

<pre><code>BlockingQueue&lt;Violation&gt; vQueue;
/* 
in the constructor I pass in a BlockingQueue object 
full of violations that need to be processed - cut out for brevity
*/

Violation v;
while ( ( v = vQueue.poll(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS) ) != null ) {
    // do stuff with the violation
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have yet to hit a race condition... but, I'm none too sure if this is truly safe.</p>
