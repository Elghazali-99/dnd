<p>We have an application that works with MS Office and uses Microsoft.mshtml.dll. We use ClickOnce to deploy the application. The application deploys without issues on most machines, but sometimes we get errors saying "System Update Required, Microsoft.mshtl.dll should be in the GAC". </p>

<p>We tried installing the PIA for Office without luck. Since Microsoft.mshtml.dll is a system dependent file we cannot include it in the package and re-distribute it. What would be the best way to deploy the application?</p>
