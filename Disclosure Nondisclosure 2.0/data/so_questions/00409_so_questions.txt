<p>I want to implement an "automatic update" system for  a windows application. 
Right now I'm semi-manually creating an <a href="http://connectedflow.com/appcasting/">"appcast"</a> which my program checks, and notifies the user that a new version is available. (I'm using
 <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page">NSIS</a> for my installers).</p>

<p>Is there software that I can use that will handle the "automatic" part of the updates, perhaps similar to  <a href="http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/">Sparkle</a> on the mac? Any issues/pitfalls that I should be aware of?</p>
