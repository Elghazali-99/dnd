<p>If I've got a table containing Field1 and Field2 can I generate a new field in the select statement? For example, a normal query would be:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Field1, Field2 FROM Table
</code></pre>

<p>And I want to also create Field3 and have that returned in the resultset... something along the lines of this would be ideal:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Field1, Field2, Field3 = 'Value' FROM Table
</code></pre>

<p>Is this possible at all?</p>
