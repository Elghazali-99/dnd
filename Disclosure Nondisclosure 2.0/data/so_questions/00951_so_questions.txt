<p>I've drawn an ellipse in the XZ plane, and set my perspective slightly up on the Y-axis and back on the Z, looking at the center of ellipse from a 45-degree angle, using gluPerspective() to set my viewing frustrum.</p>

<p>Unrotated, the major axis of the ellipse spans the width of my viewport.  When I rotate 90-degrees about my line-of-sight, the major axis of the ellipse now spans the height of my viewport, thus deforming the ellipse (in this case, making it appear less eccentric).</p>

<p>What do I need to do to prevent this deformation (or at least account for it), so rotation about the line-of-sight preserves the perceived major axis of the ellipse (in this case, causing it to go beyond the viewport)?</p>
