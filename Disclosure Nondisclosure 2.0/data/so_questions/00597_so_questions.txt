<p>How can you obtain the Type (the name as a string is sufficient) of an Object in VB6 at runtime?</p>

<p>i.e. something like:</p>

<pre><code>If Typeof(foobar) = "CommandButton" Then ...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>/EDIT:</strong> to clarify, I need to check on Dynamically Typed objects. An example:</p>

<pre><code>Dim y As Object 

Set y = CreateObject("SomeType")

Debug.Print( &lt;The type name of&gt; y)
</code></pre>

<p>Where the output would be "CommandButton"</p>
