<p>So I've been poking around with C# a bit lately, and all the Generic Collections have me a little confused. Say I wanted to represent a data structure where the head of a tree was a key value pair, and then there is one optional list of key value pairs below that (but no more levels than these). Would this be suitable?</p>

<pre><code>public class TokenTree
{
    public TokenTree()
    {
        /* I must admit to not fully understanding this,
         * I got it from msdn. As far as I can tell, IDictionary is an
         * interface, and Dictionary is the default implementation of
         * that interface, right?
         */
        SubPairs = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();
    }

    public string Key;
    public string Value;
    public IDictionary&lt;string, string&gt; SubPairs;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's only really a simple shunt for passing around data.</p>
