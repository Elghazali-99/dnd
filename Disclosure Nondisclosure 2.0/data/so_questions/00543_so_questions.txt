<p>Say I have a <code>Textbox</code> nested within a <code>TabControl</code>.  </p>

<p>When the form loads, I would like to focus on that <code>Textbox</code> (by default the focus is set to the <code>TabControl</code>).</p>

<p>Simply calling <code>textbox1.focus()</code> in the <code>Load</code> event of the form does not appear to work.  </p>

<p>I have been able to focus it by doing the following:</p>

<pre><code> private void frmMainLoad(object sender, EventArgs e)
 {
     foreach (TabPage tab in this.tabControl1.TabPages) 
     {
         this.tabControl1.SelectedTab = tab;
     }
 }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong></p>

<p>Is there a more elegant way to do this?</p>
