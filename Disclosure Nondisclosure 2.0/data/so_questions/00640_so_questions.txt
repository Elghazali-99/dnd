<p>I'm trying to create a Palm OS app to check a web site every X minutes or hours, and provide a notification when a piece of data is available.  I know that this kind of thing can be done on the new Palm's - for example, my Centro can have email or web sites download when the application isn't on top - but I don't know how to do it.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?</p>
