<p>A DB Audit Trail captures the User Last Modified, Modified Date, and Created Date.</p>

<p>There are several possible implementations:</p>

<ul>
<li>SQL Server Triggers</li>
<li>Add UserModified, ModifiedDate, CreatedDate columns to the database and include logic in Stored Procedures or Insert, Update statements accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be nice if you include implementation (or link to) in your answer.  </p>
