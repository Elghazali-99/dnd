<p>I have 2 time values which have the type <code>datetime.time</code>. I want to find their difference. The obvious thing to do is t1 - t2, but this doesn't work. It works for objects of type <code>datetime.datetime</code> but not for <code>datetime.time</code>. So what is the best way to do this?</p>
