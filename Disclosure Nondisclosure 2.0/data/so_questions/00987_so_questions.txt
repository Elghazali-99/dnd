<p>I need to do a multilingual website, with urls like</p>

<pre><code>www.domain.com/en/home.aspx for english
www.domain.com/es/home.aspx for spanish
</code></pre>

<p>In the past, I would set up two virtual directories in IIS, and then detect the URL in global.aspx and change the language according to the URL</p>

<pre><code>Sub Application_BeginRequest(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Dim lang As String
    If HttpContext.Current.Request.Path.Contains("/en/") Then
        lang = "en"
    Else
        lang = "es"
    End If
    Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo(lang)
    Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture(lang)


End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>The solution is more like a hack.  I'm thinking about using Routing for a new website.  </p>

<p><strong>Do you know a better or more elegant way to do it?</strong></p>

<p>edit: The question is about the URL handling, not about resources, etc.</p>
