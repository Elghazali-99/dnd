<p>I have a large table with 1 million+ records. Unfortunately, the person who created the table decided to put dates in a <code>varchar(50)</code> field.</p>

<p>I need to do a simple date comparison -</p>

<pre><code>datediff(dd, convert(datetime, lastUpdate, 100), getDate()) &lt; 31
</code></pre>

<p>But it fails on the <code>convert()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Conversion failed when converting datetime from character string.
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently there is something in that field it doesn't like, and since there are so many records, I can't tell just by looking at it. How can I properly sanitize the entire date field so it does not fail on the <code>convert()</code>? Here is what I have now:</p>

<pre><code>select count(*)
from MyTable
where
    isdate(lastUpdate) &gt; 0
    and datediff(dd, convert(datetime, lastUpdate, 100), getDate()) &lt; 31
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not concerned about performance in this case. This is going to be a one time query. Changing the table to a datetime field is not an option.</p>

<p>I've tried adding the third argument, and it makes no difference.</p>

  <p>The problem is most likely how the data is stored, there are only two safe formats; ISO YYYYMMDD; ISO 8601 yyyy-mm-dd Thh:mm:ss:mmm (no spaces)</p>

<p>Wouldn't the <code>isdate()</code> check take care of this?</p>

<p>I don't have a need for 100% accuracy. I just want to get most of the records that are from the last 30 days.</p>

<pre><code>select isdate('20080131') -- returns 1
select isdate('01312008') -- returns 0
</code></pre>

  <p>Place the CASE and ISDATE inside the CONVERT() function.</p>

<p>Thanks! That did it.</p>
