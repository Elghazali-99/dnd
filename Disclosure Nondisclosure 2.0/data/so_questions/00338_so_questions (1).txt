<p>I'm building a RESTful web service which has multiple URIs for one of its resources, because there is more than one unique identifier. Should the server respond to a GET request for an alternate URI by returning the resource, or should I send an HTTP 3xx redirect to the canonical URI? Is <em>HTTP 303 (see also)</em> the most appropriate redirect?</p>

<p>Clarification: the HTTP specification makes it clear that the choice of redirect depends on which URI future requests should use. In my application, the 'canonical' URI is the most stable of the alternatives; an alternative URI will always direct to same canonical URI, or become invalid.</p>
