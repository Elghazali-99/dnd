<p>Is there a way to select data where any one of multiple conditions occur on the same field?</p>

<p>Example: I would typically write a statement such as:</p>

<pre><code>select * from TABLE where field = 1 or field = 2 or field = 3
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to instead say something like:</p>

<pre><code>select * from TABLE where field = 1 || 2 || 3
</code></pre>

<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
