<p>(assume php5) consider</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

    $foo = 'some words';

    //case 1
    print "these are $foo";

    //case 2
    print "these are {$foo}";

    //case 3
    print 'these are ' . $foo;
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Is there much of a difference between 1 and 2?</p>

<p>If not, what about between 1/2 and 3?</p>
