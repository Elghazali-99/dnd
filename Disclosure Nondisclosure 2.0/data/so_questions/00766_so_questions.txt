<p>Two reasons this would be useful, in case there's some other way to achieve these goals:
1) Building in the Flash IDE is really slow; I was hoping a third-party compiler would be faster.
2) It would be nice to be able to build projects on machines that don't have the Flash IDE installed.
I'm familiar with other AS3 compilers that are out there, but I don't know of any that take FLA files as input.</p>
