<p>I'm guessing it needs to be something like:</p>

<pre><code>CONVERT(CHAR(24), lastModified, 101)
</code></pre>

<p>However I'm not sure of the right value for the third parameter.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Well I'm trying to write a script to copy my sql server db to a sqlite file, which gets downloaded to an air app, which then syncs the data to another sqlite file. I'm having a ton of trouble with dates. If I select a date in air and try to insert it, it fails because it's not in the right format... even if it was a valid date to begin with. I figured I'd try to experiment with the unix time since that's the only thing thats worked so far. I am considering just leaving them as varchar because I don't sort by them anyway.</p>
