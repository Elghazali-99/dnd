<p>How do you specify that a foreign key constraint should be a 1:1 relationship in transact sql? Is declaring the column UNIQUE enough? Below is my existing code.!</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE [dbo].MyTable(
    [MyTablekey] INT IDENTITY(1,1) NOT FOR REPLICATION NOT NULL,
    [OtherTableKey] INT NOT NULL UNIQUE
        CONSTRAINT [FK_MyTable_OtherTable] FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES [dbo].[OtherTable]([OtherTableKey]),
    ...
    CONSTRAINT [PK_MyTable] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
    (
        [MyTableKey] ASC
    ) WITH (PAD_INDEX  = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE  = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS  = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS  = ON) ON [PRIMARY]
) ON [PRIMARY]
GO
</code></pre>
