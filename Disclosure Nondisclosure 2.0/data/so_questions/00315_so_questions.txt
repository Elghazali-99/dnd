<p>I'm giving a presentation to a Java User's Group on Groovy and I'm going to be doing some coding during the presentation to show some side-by-side Java/Groovy.  I really like the GroovyConsole as it's simple and I can resize the text easily.  </p>

<p>I'm wondering if there is anything similar for Java?  I know I could just use Eclipse but I'd rather have a smaller app to use without having to customize a view.  What's the community got?</p>
