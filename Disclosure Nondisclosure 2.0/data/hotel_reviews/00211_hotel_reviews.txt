We were very happy with our stay. Very nice hotel with super friendly staff. Room was clean and spacious. Had microwave, mini fridge, coffee maker. Pool area and exercise room were nice clean. Continental breakfast had lots of choices and tasted great! Loved that it was just a quick walk next door to dinner. Definitely would recommend to family friends and will absolutely stay again!
