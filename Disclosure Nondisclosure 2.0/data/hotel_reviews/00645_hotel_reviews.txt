The hotel is OK. We stay there because of the big, warm, indoor salt water pool. Service could be better - concierge didn't give us the wi-fi log in at check in; we had to call to get it. Guests get vouchers for breakfast which is ordered off a menu - not convenient if you're in a hurry in the morning like we were. The restaurant opens at 7 and we had to be somewhere at 7:45 with a 10 min drive. The first thing the waitress told us when we walked in was that she just seated a large party and it was going to be a while. Then she left. We had to order overpriced cereal and oatmeal and wolf it down.
