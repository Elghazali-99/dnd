The hotel was very mediocre - even less than what you would expect from a Super 8. Also, upon check-in, they assessed me an extra 15.00 fee for my dog even though that fee was not disclosed on Hotels.com or the Super 8 hotel interconnect on Policies that is part of the Hotels.com website. Thus the hotel stay turned out to be an 80. a night deal which is more than the amount a rational person would want to pay to stay at a Super 8.
