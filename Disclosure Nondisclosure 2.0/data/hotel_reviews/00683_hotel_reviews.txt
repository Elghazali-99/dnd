Typical, but clean and dog friendly room. Food and service at O'Brien's Restaurant and Pub was top notch! Sarah was a most pleasant and dedicated bar tender and server. Enjoyed our evening of food and conversation.Dear Sandbar16 - Thank you so much for taking the time to write this review! We hope you'll be back with us again in the future. We'll be sure to pass along your kind words to Sarah at O'Brien's.
