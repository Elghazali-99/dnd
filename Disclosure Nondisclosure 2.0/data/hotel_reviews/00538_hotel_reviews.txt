The inside of the Hotel is old and it smells. The elevators had a n harsh smell of oil. When I reserved my room through Hotels.com it mentioned "Free Breakfast" - what a joke. It's a voucher (1 person is allowed $7 off a breakfast of the menu, and $14 total off for 2 or more people at the restaurant. It's really false publicity! I will not be staying at that hotel again. Bathroom in the room was not cleaned. Mirrors were dirty. It's like the rooms were done in a hurry! Roll away bed was pushed in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket. The reservation was for 3. Just a set of 2 towels. We had the heat full blast, and we froze in the middle of the night. Very poor managed!
