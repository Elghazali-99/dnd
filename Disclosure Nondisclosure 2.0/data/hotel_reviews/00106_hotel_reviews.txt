The room was big and the hotel staff were nice, but I couldn't get over the smelly linens. When I lay down on the bed, all I could smell was dirty old sweat socks! I don't think they ever used detergent or fabric softener to wash the linens!They were that horrible! I had to spray the linens with perfume so I wouldn't smell them 'au naturel' while I'm sleeping! I'm never going to stay in this hotel ever again!
