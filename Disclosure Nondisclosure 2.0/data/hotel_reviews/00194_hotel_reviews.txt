The staff at the Fairfield Inn were amazing. They arranged a cab for us, offered us hot tea after a late night arrival on a very cold evening, they check in on us the next day to make sure we were settled and had everything we needed. They made sure our stay at their hotel was comfortable. An extra thank you to Candice, Bea, and Donna. Thank you ladies for going above and beyond. Great breakfast in the morning too!!
