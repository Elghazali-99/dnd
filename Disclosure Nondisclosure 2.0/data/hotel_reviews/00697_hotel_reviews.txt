The hotel was under renovations when we got there, that would have been nice to know prior to booking, it just didn't look nice from the outside and some area on the inside also. Other than that the staff were nice and accomodating, it was convenient to have a full restaurant/pub in the hotel, for different optionsat breakfast, not just a continental breakfast bar. The housekeeper cleaned our room when we were out and took a knife and pizza pan that belonged to me (obviously thinking it belonged to the hotel) and the restaurant staff managed to scour the kitchen, find and return them to me before I left (not an easy task to find one knife). All in all it was a nice stay, and I wouldn't mind returning, I would like to see the improvements.
