It has been years since I've stayed in a Day's inn but based on the rate and location I decided to go ahead and book my room there. I was very pleasantly surprised. I expected a very basic motel and was surprised at the spaciousness and quality of the room and extra perks, eg. breakfast, refrig. etc. I will certainly consider staying at a Days Inn again.
