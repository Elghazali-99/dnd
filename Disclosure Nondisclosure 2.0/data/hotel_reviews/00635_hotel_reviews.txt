This hotel is located right off the highway. Check in was a little off to the right. I thought the entrance should have been located closer to the check in area. Instead it was in between the hotel and connected function facility.Pros: The room was clean & comfortable. Check out is at NoonCons: The door would not close by itself & the water in the shower backed up.
