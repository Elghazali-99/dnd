We enjoyed two great days away. They let us check in early and check out late for free. The hot tub was great, pool was a little loud because of school vacation but the attendant was the friendliest gentleman. Wifi didn't work well with just one of our three devices. Breakfast was definitely worth getting out of bed for. Will definitely consider staying there again for a getaway or business.
