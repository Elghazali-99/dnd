Having moved rooms because of noise twice, I'm still waiting for the manager to return my call!! Three times I have left messages for the none existing manager. I hope the owner is aware of the poor service the hotel provides at its front desk and office!Dear Allpro63, Thank you for taking the time to write this review. We appreciate your feedback. My sincere apologies that you had to move rooms twice during your stay. Sometimes noise is beyond our control but we do try to do our best for each guest. Thank you!
