Excellent value, nice clean room , quiet, had fun at the bar our bartender was REALY nice and friendly. For sure this would be my second home if it wasn't so far away from my Massachusetts home. Would definitely recommend this Hotel to anyone staying in the area.Dear T2359WMstephenb - Thanks so much for the kind words! We are glad you enjoyed your stay, and we look forward to having you back with us on your next trip to the area :)
