This Days Inn is located off the Strip which is what we wanted. It was still just a few minutes drive to anywhere we wished to go in Branson. The breakfast included waffles, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy as well as cold cereals and oatmeal. The property is on a steep hill, so park closer to the street and use the stairs closer to the front so you'll have fewer flights of stairs to climb. The only complaint we had was that our room's carpet was dirty, evidently from what the parking lot and walking surfaces had been paved with. We would stay here again though.
