I had a nice time at the Best Western Hotel. It was clean and the staff was friendly. the work out area and pool was a good size and the hot tub was relaxing. the restaurant was resealable, but the only thing there I didn't like was getting a water with dinner that came in a plastic cup. Over all it was a nice stay.
