Smell of freshly smoked marijuana in the halls on the way to the pool all day long. Hotel is suppose to be family friendly and staff was walking through the same halls and didn't appear to care. Pool was rented out to a birthday party of non guests to the hotel so overpacked and could not swim. Later it was quite dirty and the hot tub had hair and dirt floating in it. Was given 2 towels and washclothes for a room with 4 people. Shower only got luke warm. Free breakfast advertised was not free. "Free" is actually for 2 people and you still pay tax and gratuity. Website and book in room states there are snack vending machines at the hotel when there is not. They have soda and ice machines only. Very disappointing.
