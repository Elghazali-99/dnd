Stayed here while doing some lake fishing for a few nights. Staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel is older but they come in and clean room every. Wifi works well. Comes with voucher for breakfast. I read some bad comments about the food but we found it to be very good. You can get the buffet on the weekend or order off the menu with a certain $ credit. Eggs, french toast and pancakes with fresh Maine blueberries very good. Yogurt parfait with granola also yummy. Located on a busy street, many shops and places to eat right there.
