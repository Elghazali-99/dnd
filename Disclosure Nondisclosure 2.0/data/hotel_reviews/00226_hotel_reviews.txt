Good experience and very convenient to where I needed to be. Hotel was quiet and staff polite and helpful. Conveniently located between two restaurants that serve decent food at reasonable prices. Only downside was that hotel room was a bit dusty... not unclean but bedside lamp had dust on base. Very well out-fitted with outlets, however, which is needed these days. Overall, I was very pleased with my stay.
