Arrived late (10:00 pm). Called ahead to give heads up of late arrival. When we arrived to check in, no one was at front desk. No sign. No human being. Nothing. Waited 15 minutes. Finally front desk person returned. Apologized. Said she had to change someone's sheets. Gross! Hotel was worn/shabby. Only plus was breakfast (included). Table service. Service was good. Food was good.
