My wife and I went to a concert at The Saenger Theater. It was very close and the stay was all around wonderful! Beautiful house, pool, room, it was quiet, delicious breakfast, fabulous service, and we met some great people too. Conversation with Steve (innkeeper) is intelligent as well. Ty Steve! We will be back!
