The Houstonian may not be the cheapest hotel in the area, but I believe it's the best. It's still a great value when you look at the service, amenities, and location. The grounds make it a wonderful oasis in a busy part of the city. Everything is kept up immaculately and is first class. The rooms have everything you could need for a comfortable stay. I loved walking the beautiful and easy to walk path around the grounds each morning and seeing/hearing all the birds. I didn't use the pool areas, but they are gorgeous and spacious. Highly recommended hotel.
