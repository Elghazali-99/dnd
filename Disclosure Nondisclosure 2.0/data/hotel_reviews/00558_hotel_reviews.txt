Room were clean, Bed was comfortable, bathroom was functional. Skip the breakfast the service is very, very slow and food is sub par, they overcooked the eggs Benedict I ordered, plus the cost of 4.25 for juice is expensive. I would recommend going across the street to the Governor's Restaurant Bakery. The front desk was very helpful and accommodating....Dear Lawrence S - Thank you for staying with us and taking the time to write this review. We're glad you enjoyed your room and our helpful staff!
