The resort was beautiful, well kept, and the room was luxurious without being opulent. We upgraded to a swim up room, which was fun for my 10 year old. Every restaurant was great, and so was the room service food. Lots of places to swim, either at the resort or the beach. The staff was consistently friendly and courteous. They had inexpensive activities like paddle boarding and kayaking available, of which we took advantage. My only complaint would be that I had trouble with the Wifi, which I paid to have unlimited access to, but it seemed spotty and inconsistent. Otherwise everything about the resort was lovely, including our giant bathtub. I would happily stay here again, with or without my little one.
