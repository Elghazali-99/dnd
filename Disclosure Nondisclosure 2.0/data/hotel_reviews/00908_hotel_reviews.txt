This hotel was horrible. The service was horrible, the cleaning crew wore regular street clothes and when they came to my room banging on the door at 11:03am that check out was 11am. I was scared, couldn't tell who they were considering the hotel was in a seedy part of town, next to a truck stop. I asked her (cleaning lady) to identify herself and then she came back with two others who couldn't speak English. Even tho I had another night's reservation, they failed to confirm/check. I asked for towels and was told by owner it's a even exchange towel system. Give old towels to get new ones.....wow The bathroom was disgusting, shower curtain hadn't been changed since the place was originally purchased. I could go on on on but I'm sure u get my point. If I wasn't in a desperate situation from last minute planning to attend the UK vs USC game in South Carolina and every hotel in the city booked. I would have never ever stayed at that Super 8 hotel.
