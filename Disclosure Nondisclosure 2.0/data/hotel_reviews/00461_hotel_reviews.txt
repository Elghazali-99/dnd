My wife and I stayed at the Houstonian for 3 nights in October. The property was lovely and the room was very comfortable. However the fitness facilities are truly amazing. The property is connected to the Houstonian Club which is a separate sports club that has truly world class facilities. It has 3 pools (a massive lap pool, resort pool and other small quiet pool), the largest gym I have seen anywhere, basketball and tennis courts, a jogging track and at least 5 studios for classes. My wife has been a regular (5 times a week) gym user for over 16 years and she has been a member of many gyms in NYC and London and this is by far the best she has experienced. She went to 3 classes and the studios, instructors and equipment could not have been better. Further there is no need to register for any class you just turn up and participate. In the luxurious locker rooms there is free coffee, tea, ice tea, water etc... We also ate at the bar and Olivette restaurant and the food and service were excellent. My wife also visited the spa and although it was expensive the facilities and service were again of the highest quality.
