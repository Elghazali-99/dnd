The hotel was clean and the people at the front desk are happy to help. Same with the staff that took care of our breakfast order. The French toast was really good, same with the oatmeal the potatoes were missing that something special but not bad. Stay away from the turkey bacon....overcooked circles of leathery meat.It was sort of annoying that there was so many people packed into the pool, that it wasn't worth going in, and that was the reason we choose the hotel.There were hockey, cheer, basketball, and gymnastics tournaments in town for the weekendSo hotels and restaurants all were at max capacity
