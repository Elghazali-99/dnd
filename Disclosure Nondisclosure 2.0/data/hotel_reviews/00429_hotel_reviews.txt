I checked in for 10 days, but checked out after 2. My problem with the hotel was room size - particularly bathroom size. The bedroom was adequate. The bathroom ceiling is at about 6.5 feet. The door opens into the tiny bathroom which makes it necessary to close the door making it extremely claustrophobic.
