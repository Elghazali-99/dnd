What a pleasant surprise! We are use to staying at expensive four star hotels but needed to complete a quick business trip and we were so delighted with this hotel. All newly remodeled, pleasant professional staff, and the hot breakfast was a perfect addition. Highly recommend and you will not be disappointed!
