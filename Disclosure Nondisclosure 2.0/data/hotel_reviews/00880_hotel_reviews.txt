Room needed updating, but for the price I could deal with that. What I couldn't overlook was the layer of dust and cobwebs covering the drapes that blows all over the room every time the air kicks on, or the toilet that isn't attached to the floor properly, or the drafty window, mildew stained tile, torn curtains, and cracked microwave door. I also wasn't expecting to spend all night smelling the food from the banquet rooms downstairs. I wasn't expecting to be amazed at the price I paid for this room, but I was at least expecting to have had them keep up with routine maintenance and cleaning, and maybe put in some air fresheners in the hallway to counteract the smells from the banquets. Overall, the bed was comfortable, the shower was hot, and I only needed someplace for 1 night to attend a conference at the university, so it served it's purpose.
