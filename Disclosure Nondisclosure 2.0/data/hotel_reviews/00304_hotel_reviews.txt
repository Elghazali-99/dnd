Located in a beautiful area of Mobile, in the historical district, the house has big porches with chairs to sit, nice gardens, and is lovely inside. Stephen can give you a verbal historical tour of the property and the town of Mobil, and he made every effort to make us comfortable. Rooms are exceptionally large.
