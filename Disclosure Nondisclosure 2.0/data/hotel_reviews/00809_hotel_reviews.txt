It was a comfortable stay. I will say that the walls are a bit thin. I didn't like hearing slamming doors throughout the night from other guests. The room was fairly clean. The beds were really comfortable. Breakfast was decent. The front desk clerk could be a bit more friendlier. I would stay there again.
