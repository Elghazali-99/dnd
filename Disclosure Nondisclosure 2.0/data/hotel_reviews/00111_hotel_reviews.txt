Having never been to Livermore, imagine my shock when the 2nd floor balcony room overlooked a parking lot and a gas station with a Jack in the Box thrown in for good measure. I thought I was staying in wine country. It would also have been nice to know that it is under construction. Granted I should have done more research but it was a last minute decision to go. The only good thing I could say is the bed was comfortable. If you are looking for a hotel right off of a freeway this one fits the bill, although way overpriced.
