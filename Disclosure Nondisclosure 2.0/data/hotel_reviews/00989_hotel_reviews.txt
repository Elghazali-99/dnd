There was a mix-up with Hotel.com, but the hotel staff connected with Hotel.com and both businesses worked it out for us. We highly appreciated that. We were given a room close to Lobby and over the pool, so it was a rather noisy room, but very convenient for our needs. The hotel couldn't help that the volley ball team yelled and ran up down stairs balconies. Just what one has to put up with during the busiest tourist season. However, with the help of the continuous running fan, the wonderful soft bed pillows being so tired, we rested very well. Breakfast was good had something for the diabetic diet, but super crowded. Probably half the folks had to take breakfast back to their rooms.
