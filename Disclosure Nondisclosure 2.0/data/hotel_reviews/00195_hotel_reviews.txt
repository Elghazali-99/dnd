Easily accessible in spite of traffic on 17. Clean. Bath a teensy bit small but still acceptable. We had a king bed - that's all they had available, but the two doubles may have been a little tight. We did use a rollaway cot for our son (5'10, 150lbs) and wound up putting the mattress on the floor the second night as the frame was simply too small for a teenage boy!
