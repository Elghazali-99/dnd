Well they must be in the midst of renovations because they did not tell any of their customers and there was dust and materials left all over the hallways. It was like the workers just up and left everything out in the open and materials all over the place. The beds were uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the heating unit. The blinds were duct taped together and the parking lights came through the curtains. And the continental breakfast was a joke. My family went down at 8:15 am and they had nothing ready. Needless to say I am never going to stay there again and we checked out early and went to eat at the Friendly's next door where it was cleaner.I wish that I can get my money refunded because it was not worth the money that I spent.
