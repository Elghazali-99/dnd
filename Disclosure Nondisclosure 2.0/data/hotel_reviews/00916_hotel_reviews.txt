The Breakfast was very good. The host showed us how to use the waffle machine. They also had a good cereal selection. He was very friendly. Location was good to get on the highway to visit fort Jackson. The room was very affordable and clean. I was disappointment no one came to clean the room on the 2nd day. The bed sheet had a large spot of what appeared to be an un-washable cooking grease.
