I booked the hotel last minute as I was simply too tired to continue driving. I'm in grad school so I needed cheap. Considering the price, the hotel amenities and upkeep was as expected. The staff was friendly enough, the hotel smelled like mildew, serious updates were needed, and the continental breakfast was lacking. The only things that I considered to be under what I paid was the bed and room itself. The bed was terribly uncomfortable. The pillows were hard and lumpy...like when you wash and then high heat dry artificial pillow stuffing and it melts together. The AC unit didn't really work. It just blew air. I was hoping it would cool down to kill the mildew smell, but it never did. The worst was that every time the AC unit kicked off, a noise would start (I'm assuming some kind of duct work) that sounded like someone was knocking at my door. This continued through the night so needless to say, I didn't sleep very well.
