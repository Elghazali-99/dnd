The Hotel and its grounds are beautiful, to say the least. Very warm, very welcoming, very grand. The staff were incredibly professional and welcoming as well. Everyone from the front desk to the spa to the bar - same level of amazing service. Speaking of the spa - I have never had a spa experience like this. Unbelievable! The ultimate in luxury in relaxation. Due to the flooding in the area we left a night early, just to be on the safe side. They did not charge us the extra night. I am seriously looking for excuses to stay at this hotel again.
