Altough they only have three guest rooms,it is worth trying to book one.This is not a hotel.It is an 1895 home that the owners live in.It includes a fresh made breakfast every morning and wonderful pool area.It is close to Loda and downtown hot spots for dining and drinking.Or just stay in and relax.
