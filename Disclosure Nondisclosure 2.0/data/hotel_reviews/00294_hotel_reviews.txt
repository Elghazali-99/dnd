We stayed here for one night during our road trip across the US. Steven was friendly and hospitable and the room was large and clean. Breakfast the next morning was delicious and plentiful. Make sure you walk around the neighbourhood during the day, there are some beautiful mansions. I highly recommend staying here if you are coming to Mobile!
