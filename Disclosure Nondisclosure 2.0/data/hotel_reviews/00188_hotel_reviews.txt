This hotel is undergoing construction. Banging and other loud noises begin early in the morning. Forget about enjoying a peaceful morning.Was very disappointed by the reaction of the hotel staff when I brought it to their attention. A free night's stay or at least a discount on my next stay may have helped the situation. Dont book this hotel until the construction is complete
