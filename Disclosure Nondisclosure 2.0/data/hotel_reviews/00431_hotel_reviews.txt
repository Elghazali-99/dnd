This hotel is way over rated, it's nothing like the description or the reviews. Basically its Old (very old) building in the heart of apartment complex/parking lot jungle. Furniture is very old, hotel theme feel like 1850s, clean but old. Tge staff is friendly but you can tell they inexperienced , mostly in there 20s. Room it self spacious but old, old carpet and TV. Bathrooms similar to Motels, bedsheets clean, new sheets, but bed is saggy. Surrounding area is jungle, literally!! Misty and not well kept. Lots traffic once you leave parking. Ppl come from surrounding complex apartments to run on trail. Bottom line, money wasted, will never come again.
