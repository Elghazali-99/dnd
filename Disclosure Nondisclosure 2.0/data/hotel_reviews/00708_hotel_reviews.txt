To our surprise the hotel was under a major reintivation, with construction materials everywhere, cluttered throughout, dirty and not well maintained. The pictures of the property on the web did not match what we actually experienced.No security at the hotel, as all of the doors from the parking lot and center courtyard where broken and not using the key pad to enter. Anyone could enter the building. Crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building. The A/C unit was very old with missing knobs and instructions that were worn off. Getting the room to a comfortable temperature was a challenge. Dirty used towels were hanging in the shower questioning whether the room had been properly cleaned from the prior occupant. Duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains. To top that off the mattress was as hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible.If it was not for us driving all day and that it was late in the evening we would have not stayed at this hotel. Worst experience at a hotel in my life time. To top it off, we paid way too much for the room based on the experience and status of the property. Terrible experience!
