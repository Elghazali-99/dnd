The two rooms given to us did not have running water so the crews were given other rooms but then a lady came yelling at them to get out, when they presented her with the new keys she told them if they did not leave she would call the police. When I tried to get a refund SAM, the mgr said no, they left because they wanted to. We will not refund anything. NOT using them again!
