We spent one night there and would stay again. The king size bedroom was clean and room had a microwave and refrigerator which was very convenient. They have a continental breakfast with omelets, waffles, yogurt, cereal, fruit, etc. The clerk was very helpful the next morning when my prescription sunglasses needed to be fixed.
