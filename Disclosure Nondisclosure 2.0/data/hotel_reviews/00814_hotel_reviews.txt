Stayed for a weekend (Thurs-Mon) and thankfully the Tigers Football team was on the road so getting a room wasn't hard. It was a great value for the little cost of the room. If you're on a tight budget, this place is great. If you're looking for a resort stay and planning on spending your entire trip in the hotel, this is not your place. Bed was great to sleep in, shower was hot to bathe in. All I needed the room for.
