From the moment of check in we were pleased. Greeted cordially (not fake) we were asked if we would need anything additional (we were 6 adults and 5 children under the age of 6 renting 3 rooms). They had already put our rooms nearby (even when requested at other hotels in advance this seems to be a HUGE request and usually not done) We have stayed at other hotels in the area but your rooms are spacious and beds are wonderful. We will continue to return here anytime we are in the area.
