We stayed one night on a family visit to my daughter's camp. It was easy to reach, easy to find and perfect for a short stay. The pool is very large, but almost too warm, and the hot tub is uninviting. We'd just come from a Hilton Garden Inn, which is a very good step up, so a comparison to the Waterville Grand Hotel is a bit loaded. We stayed at the Comfort Inn last year, and I'll just say we were determined NOT to stay there again. I'd go back to the Best Western, but I'd suggest you drop the "grand" from the name.
