Showed up on Friday left on Sunday. Everything was good. Breakfast was great. Very nice staff. The only problem was the bathroom. The toilet, shower head, and tub faucet were loose. It looks like they tried to update the tub area but didn't do a good job of it. The lights in the bathroom are exetremely hot. Other than that good trip.
