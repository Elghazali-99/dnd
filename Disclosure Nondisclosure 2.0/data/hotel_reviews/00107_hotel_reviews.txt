Nice place no complaints, one thing they didn't tell me,is they put a 100 hold on your card that stays for a couple days after you check out. I know this is not rare but any place that does has told me. I ended up calling trying to get it refunded. The breakfast in morning was pretty good, they had a full buffet not just some pakage pastries. Leave your swimsuit at home though the pool is small very small.
