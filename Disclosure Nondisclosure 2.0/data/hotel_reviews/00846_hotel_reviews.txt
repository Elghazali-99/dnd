They allow pets (dogs only) in this hotel, which is probably great for pet owners, but not so great when the dogs have accidents, and the hallway smells of doggy poo. It was cleaned up, but the smell did linger. Otherwise hotel was a good value for the price. And I would recommend to people who absolutely have to take their dogs with them while they travel.
