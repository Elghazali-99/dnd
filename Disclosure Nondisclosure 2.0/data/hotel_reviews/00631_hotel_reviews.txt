Staff was very nice and helpful. We ended up arriving earlier than expected and when I called to see if we could check in early; the response was very welcoming.My only critique would be the constant slamming of doors in the morning by housekeeping. They use the lock bar to keep the door in-locked while they go in and out to clean. The problem then becomes the constant loud slamming of doors
