Needed to leave a day sooner than expected, knew this at check in and told them so. But since I had booked thru Expedia, they stated that I had to get approval thru them, which I did. Upon check-out I asked to verify that I was only being charged for the 3 nights as opposed to the 4, and they said I was only being charged for the 3 days, and gave me a receipt showing that. But the next day, my credit card used for that stay posted the amount for a 4 night stay. In calling the front desk, I got form letter like answers. I will never use this Best Western hotel or Expedia again.
