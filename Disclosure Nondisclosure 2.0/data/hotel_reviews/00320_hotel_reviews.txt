Positives: Location! It is on the main strip, next to Hard Rock Cafe and lots of food options. Walking distance to Waikiki Beach and The Cheesecake Factory. Room size is decent. Negatives: In major need of a renovation! Very outdated and the lifts smell. Wifi connection is poor. Overall, would stay here again.
