This hotel is the best bang for your buck in Columbia. Great location, very clean, very nice staff and rooms are large and come with a microwave,fridge and coffee pot. It's older but redecroated rooms make it feel like home. I have 2 kids going to school in Columbia and when I come to visit I always check to see if this hotel has the best deal and it usually does. I stay here whenever I can, highly recommend for the price.
