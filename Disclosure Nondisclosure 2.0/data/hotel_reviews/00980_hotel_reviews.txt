My wife and I stayed here recently on our first visit to Branson. The room was clean and updated. The breakfast in the morning was ample and lots of variety. The staff was friendly and very helpful. We booked a show through the hotel at the tribute theater that was a hoot. I would definitely stay here again. Would be a good central location if I was staying with my whole family also. Lots to do in the area.
