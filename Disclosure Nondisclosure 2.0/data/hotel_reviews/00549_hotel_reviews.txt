Cramped location with odd entry by traffic light, clearly caters to groups and sports teams. Nicest staff ever! Room was clean and comfortable, is a single story building, so rooms go on forever down long hallways. Lucky we were near the gym, which was better than most. Great breakfast at a very reasonable price. Room includes a voucher for up to 14.00 of your breakfast order, so you get a hot meal straight from the short order cook, not some steam table/cereal bar like most places. Portions were huge! Free buffet with pizza, cheese/crackers, veggies and dip from 4-7pm on Friday evenings in the bar. Facility is a bit quirky and a bit tired, but staff is warm and friendly.Wish we had eaten dinner there and not at the disappointing Chinese restaurant next door!
