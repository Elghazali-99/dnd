We will not be staying at this hotel again. Our room had no heat, the shower curtain had mold on it and the hotel was not very clean. We tried to go to the pool/hot tub but it was packed. There was a birthday party at the pool at 7:30 at night for a pre-teen boy. It was very loud and the pool area smelled horrible. Then to top it all off the bed was horribly uncomfortable.
