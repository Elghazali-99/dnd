The hotel was adequate and met my basic needs. It met my expectations for this type of hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. The TV was difficult to use - you couldn't get directly to a specific channel and it didn't have all the network channels, presumably b/c it was DirectTV. The continental breakfast consisted of coffee/tea and muffins so I wouldn't really call it a continental breakfast.
