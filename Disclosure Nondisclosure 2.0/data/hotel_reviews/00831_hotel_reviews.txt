My daughter was moving into Mizzou so we went up the night before I made the reservations online I must say when I walked into the lobby of the hotel seem older but nice I then checked into my room went and got something to eat came back use the restroom to see two tiny bugs not sure what they were at this point I killed them and wanted to my room saw a roach crawling up my drink when I called the front desk I told the guy I have bugs in my room he said yes as if this were a regular occurrence and then took him about 15 minutes to get me moved to a different room to say the least I was absolutely mortified this hotel is disgusting
