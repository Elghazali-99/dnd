We walked into the lobby and there was stuff all over the place. They set up a folding sight screen to hide their bird and other personal stuff. The motel was a bit creepy. I used one of my shirts to cover the pillow because the place was dirty and not sure I wanted to put my head on their pillow. Had nowhere else to go, otherwise I would have.
