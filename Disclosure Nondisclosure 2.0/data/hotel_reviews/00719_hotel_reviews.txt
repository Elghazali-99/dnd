This hotel is absolutely disgusting! You could not pay me to stay here again. We requested a non smoking room , but the entire first floor smelled of smoke!! Rooms are very old and dark. Shower which I was even scared to step into barefoot didn't get above Luke warm. The little coffee machine in the room also didn't work..it was just bad all the way around!! I wasn't expecting fancy being a best western but clean and not outdated would have been nice! Stay elsewhere! !
