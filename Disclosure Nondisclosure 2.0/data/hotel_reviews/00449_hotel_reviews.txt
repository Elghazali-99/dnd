My husband and I took a stacation here and it indeed is a five star from the amazing service to all the updated amenities, pools, gym everything was almost perfect. We chose this hotel after I verified that their shuttle went within 3 miles also viewing this on their website. Well time to take off and there was ' no shuttle ' available on Sunday after 6pm which I could not verify. That put a twist on things, we drove around the corner anyhow.
