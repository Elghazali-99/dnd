We had 3 of us and they had no queen rooms available!! Beds were small! Breakfast was not included as written! Breakfast was a $14. Voucher and for only 2 people, not 3! So, we did not use it at all! Went elsewhere to eat! Also, when Maid service came in room to make beds and such ... They didn't leave fresh towels or new coffee packets!
