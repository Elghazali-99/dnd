Awesome hotel, we brought our 6 month old son and he absolutely loved the saltwater pool it actually helped his dry skin he had on his back. We took turns trying the hot tub which was amazing as well. Had a beer in the bar and ordered dinner to bring back to the room, the bar tender was very friendly and food was good too. Overall our stay was an A+!!
