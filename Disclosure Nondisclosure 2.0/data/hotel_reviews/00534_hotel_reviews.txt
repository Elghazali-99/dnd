This hotel was being remodled and should not have been renting rooms on the second floor where we were assigned,it was a total shambles including large holes in the curtains and debris laying everywhere. How could they expect anyone to stay in that kind of environment. We looked at the room and left and rented another hotel, we had already signed in and were werelocked into the contrac with our prebooking through expedia. We are disappointed with expedia on this one.
