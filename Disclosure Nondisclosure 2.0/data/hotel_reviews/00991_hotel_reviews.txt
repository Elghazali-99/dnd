I went to Branson for 4th of July so there were VERY few affordable options as every hotel raised it's prices. I paid close to double the price of what this hotel normally goes for. So I was already paying more than I should (beds and pillows were very uncomfortable) and on top of it, they have a ridiculous pet policy. 10 extra per night is not bad - it's the mandatory 50 cleaning fee whether the animal makes a mess or not. Paid way more than I should for an establishment that did not earn that value.
