The hotel is in a prime location. Close to the highway and easy to get to. Breakfast was OK, but lacked variety. Some eggs and more fruit options would have been nice. The other issue is how loud it was in the halls at night. Doors banging and people talking went right through the walls. Hard to get a good night sleep. The front desk was very helpful and friendly. I did have trouble accessing the WiFi. Overall it wasn't a bad stay but there were issues.
