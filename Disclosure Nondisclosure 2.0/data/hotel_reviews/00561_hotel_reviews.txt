We stayed for 3 nights and the first night was great. Room could have been a little cleaner especially the carpet and corners of room. Lots of dust so allergies became a problem. BIG NOTE! This is a dog friendly hotel! I love dogs and have 2 of my own but do not bring them to hotels. The 2nd night a dog actually 2 dogs started barking at 4:00 am. We were woken up until 6:00! The hotel usually has the 1st floor reserved for barking dogs but these people ended up on the 2nd floor. The Hotel kindly gave us credit for the one night. Not sure if I would stay there again.
