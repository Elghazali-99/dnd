Staff was very nice. The outside appearance is nice. Inside my feet and socks literally turned black from dirty carpet. The Lights, phone, and corners had mold. No pool, coiffed maker broken, half the outlets plugs fell out and a towel had mold on it. I couldn't switch hotels cause area was booked for military graduation.
