Rooms were comfortable and clean and the staff was very peasant, great stay for the price. Had dinner one night in the restaurant which wasn't very good but there are some local pubs in the area which were very good. Breakfast in the restaurant was good. Overall the stay was a good value.Dear williamtO4368AZ - Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel!
