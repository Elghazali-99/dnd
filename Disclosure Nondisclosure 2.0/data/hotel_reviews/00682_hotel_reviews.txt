The hotel was nice in the front however our room was showing it's wear.  The carpet was stained and in pretty bad shape however everything else was fine.  Beds were comfortable and bathroom was clean.  TV channels were not that great however that was not a major issue.  As the hotel is under renovation, I am hoping that carpets and windows are part of the reno.  Would probably stay there again.
