Stayed one night to attend a meeting held the next day. Dined at in-house restaurant, The Olivette, where the wine list and the meal were excellent and the service was very good. The attractively decorated rooms are very quiet with a forest view out the windows. It is hard to imagine you are in the middle of a major city here. The room was very clean and there was nice turndown service. The room was adequately lighted and there were outlets to charge electronics. There were nice pillows on the bed and the linens were crisp and new-looking. Check in and Check Out were a breeze. The front desk verified my expenses and gave me a print out of my charges.
