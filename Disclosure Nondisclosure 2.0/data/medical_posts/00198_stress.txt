My son is 37 years old and hit his head in dec 2013 and has been having seizures has been to hospital 3 times they did the EEG with camera in hospital saw one of the few Epitologists in KC Mo  he sd were not epileptic seizures but stress seizures. They told him that sometimes a head injury brings forward things they suppressed clear back to childhood. His dad was an absent father, He lost his uncle who he was very close to when he was a teen and never cried. At 24 his 28 year old wife had a massive stroke he stayed w her 10 more years then they divorced his new girlfriend had showers of strokes and he took care of her a year and when her family didn't help like they said they would he moved her to her moms and is now with a woman who is sick all the time. The doctors told him that it is common with head injuries all the things they suppressed come forward and he has to see a psychiatrist in order to quit having seizures and until he does he will continue to have seizures. Has anybody out there ever heard of this? He lost his job over it because he worked for a small company and companies with less than 50 employees don't have to follow FMLA that sure added to his stress! He also has been for quite sometime a habitual liar. Somebody please HELP  !Does any of this even sound right?This young man has had a job ever since he was 15 years old and has always been the care giver doesn't know how to handle not working not being able to drive and stress of not being able to pay bills I am not a rich person and can't help him pay monthly bills. Is it the suppressed things in his life that have caused this or is it the stress he is going thru right now?
