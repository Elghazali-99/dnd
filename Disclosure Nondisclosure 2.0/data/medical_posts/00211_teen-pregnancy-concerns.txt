I'm 18 years old and the other night I had sex with this girl and i don't know if I got her pregnant. Me and this girl usually have sex but I do not have any feelings for her whatsoever. Anyways, when we had sex a couple nights ago I pulled out (yes I have a condom as always) and the condom was REALLY wet inside and mostly at the head (not the base). During sex it kept slipping a bit (I usually use this size it's even tight on me) and I figured it was her fluids making it do that. Afterwards I tried to squeeze the tip but nothing came out. I am thinking that it was pre *** mixed with the lunrication from the condom. But it seemed more wet as usual. I have no idea. I think to my self "it's supposed to be real wet inside you don't want it on the outside do you?" And then I tell myself "what if she's pregnant" I also have bad anxiety so I might be overthinking. I also told her to get plan B but she said "no we're fine". She won't listen so if she ended up pregnant I'd feel trapped. But first, do you guys think I got her pregnant!?
