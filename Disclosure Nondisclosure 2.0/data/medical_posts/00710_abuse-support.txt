My mother have no respect for men!  She will do whatever is on her power to subdue them to a role of complete submission to her. Once they are under her domain, she humuliates them to the extreme. I hate my father for never standing up to her. All my step fathers fell into the same trap. I HAVE NEVER, EVER SUBMITTED TO HER!!!!! Rarely has she been uble to control me. Nevertheless, I can't stand women in any position of authority over men. The slighest deviation of the traditional "female" role poses a threat to me. I then slip into a "defence" mode and before I know, I am at war with them for no other reason than STAND-UP to them for attempting to excersise control over me! I all reflects back on my mother controlling all the men in her life. This has caused me to wage many useless battles against women. I lost many jobs for refusing to submit to them. While I do realize that not all women are controling, I perceive them all as a threat, and am never able to trust or lower my guard to any of them, with very few exception. I deal with the problem by avoiding them altogether including sex. I am being radical and irrational!!!! I do not want to continue going through life in a never ending power struggle with females. Stay away and avoiding them has been my tactics until now, but is seems so shallow to me that I do not have a better tool to overcome this problem.
