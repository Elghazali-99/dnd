Ok basicly I'm 15 and for the last few months I've been haunted by a nickname that I despise with a passion. One of my best friends thought of it one night and it could have died that night but others kept it alive. Since then I've been refered to it by everyone I know (at school btw) and it makes me want to snap just hearing it. I've begged with my friends to stop, I've shouted at them and even stopped talking to them. There is one in particular who I just started to despise weeks ago. Just the sight of him makes me want to hit him.
 It's still going on now and it's got to the point where I just can't stand the sight of these people. Occasionally they ask 'What's wrong with it?' and they know I hate it but keep going on. Every week or so when I get so pissed with them it's all 'Oh, I love you really.' but if they did love me they'd stfu.
I'm very, very close to dumping them but I don't know what to do because I won't have any mates then.
 I have important tests coming up in school, which start tomorrow and the last thing I need on my mind is this.
Can you answer am I depressed and what advice can you give me. I'm desperate at this point, Please help me.
