Hello I'm 25 years old and I have depression that sets in and stays for days to weeks. Its been going on since I was a girl along with it I pull out my hair and have chronic pain and fatigue. I have weight gain and feel worthless most days. It does seem to go away when I get out and about but the simple things like a bill or a phone call can change my mood and Its so hard to get back from that point. If there is someone who has figured out a system or anything besides drugs please help. Its getting to the point where life is not as promising as I thought it was staring at the barrel of 30 years old. I fear I wont ever finish college or own my own business. I have great dreams but get derailed several weeks at a time. I'm mother to a wonderful 6 year old! He is my world and I would love to be more active with him but as I write this I am in bed. In bed is where I am most days.
 Please don't read and run. God bless everyone suffering its taken a lot for me to realize this is not what life is meant to be. I am now engaged and fear that this will ruin things eventually. I only ever remember feeling balanced when I was pregnant with my son.
