Been married 9 years - together (on and off) 19 years - for the past 5 years things have not been good.  Hubby was never home when he was in town, and in Mexico (fishing !) half of the time.  I personally went thru some traumatic times in the past 5 years also.  My parents passed away, lost my job of 18 years, one of my closest friends died, and I had 3 beloved dogs pass too.  And where was hubby when I needed just a little support?  You probably know the answer to that! - I told him I wanted a divorce back in 2009, but he told me he loved me and we could work things out...the usual - and surprise!  things were good for a month and then right back to normal...where I was obviously invisible!  So yesterday, we went to the paralegal and got things rolling...no fighting...what so ever - we almost got along there better than we normally do!  So why am I feeling so depressed?  And the thing is, I am not one to cry - but I am.  I've spent the past 5 years "alone" (or so it seemed...even though we lived in the same house) - I am questioning myself if this divorce is the right thing, I am questioning as to whether he agreed for my sake, I feel like I don't have a support system...probably because I don't!  Over the years he made sure I didn't have friends - "everyone hated him....blah blah blah" - I don't even have anyone to visit to share a cup of coffee with and get out my feelings -  so now....I have to rehab a house so I can move into it and I'm feeling overwhelmed with that thought even though I know exactly what needs to be done and I have the  money to contract it out.  I sound like I'm talking in circles doesn't it?  I apologize - but it is just the way I'm thinking now.  Thanks for "listening"
