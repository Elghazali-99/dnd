Hi. Im 43 years old and have been having problems with my periods. I will be a month late, or sometimes even 3 months late. They will be heavy sometimes and light other times. This started about 3 yrs ago. My baby boys father passed away in 2004 and I stayed single for at least 8 yrs. After awhile of being alone, my family thought it was time for me to move on with my life, so I decided to start dating again. well I meet this great man and ever since we started having intercourse. All these problems started happening. Missed periods, unusual headaches, and even real bed UTIs. I have even been getting real upset over nothing. I cry almost every night over things that happened years ago. Last year I only had 6 periods. I know im not pregnant. I have taken at least 15 pregnancy test over the past three years and all negative. Sex has been painful for me, but I was assuming it was because I didn't have sex for almost 8 yrs. Just wanted to know if anyone had any advice. Thank you so much.
