Im currently 16 Last year i suffered from depression and had paranoia when it came to realtionships with friends and family however i have some incidences over the past few months which have really scared me, my parents left me home alone and i was sure that there was something outside my door and that i couldnt get out of my room, my prents had to come home and i was on the floor screaming, we dont really talk about it they think somebod slipped me drugs thats the only conclusion they can come to. Then there was the noise that followed me around taugnting me and then there was the teddy that wanted to kill me and i was to afraid to put him outside because i thought that would make him angreyer. I dont know what to do my parents know vaguly but they just tell me somebody slipping me drugs, i go to an al girls private school its not drugs. But the thing that scares me the most is what if im mental i mean if i think my teddys going to kill me what if i think my mums goingto kill me next. Im really scared and i dont know whats wrong with me  anybody please help
