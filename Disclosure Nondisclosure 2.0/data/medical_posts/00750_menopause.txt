I'm 48 years old and going into menopause. I'm still menstruating monthly but the periods are very light. My issue is about a week before my period I get severe PMS. I'm not sure if its so much worse because i'm going into menopause or if this is the new normal. It's SOOOO BAD! I can't really talk to anyone because I'm angry at everyone for whatever stupid reason. I become very emotional and cry alot, my face breaks out in huge welts-not pimples more like blisters in the same areas every time.The worst part is I get waves of such severe depression it scares me! It does subside after a few minutes but I'm still depressed. If this decides to come for more than just those few minutes about 4-5 times a day I can't see how I will cope! I'm very happy otherwise,just started a new job,moved to a wonderful home in a great town,my children are stable. I don't know why this happens..especially the awful waves of depression. I can feel it come on and I can't move or talk. It stops me dead in my tracks and I pray that it goes away! If thats how bad depression can get I understand suicide..
