I have finally moved from the town where my ex and his girlfriend lives and I feel good...I still have sad moments and the kids move out on Monday so we will see how I go on my own. ..but I am looking forward to it...I took your advice and decided not to date until the end of 2012....this will give me time to like myself.....because I have been all over the place in the last 3 months....it has been a nightmare...but the sun is starting to shine and hopefully it will shine brighter every day....I have a great lawyer and he is dealing with the ex....and I have a great counciller and I have put myself on the sucide watch program...so someone rings me everyday for 2 months and I find this a great comfort at the moment and I do find I dont go to that dark place anymore....but I want to stay on the program just to make sure.....I cant believe all the emotions I have been through in the last 3 months....I could of made some really dumb mistakes if it wasnt for this site and my friends....I hope I continue on improving and I pray everynight for strength everyday and slowly I will get there....but I will keep you updated.....If you are going through any of the above things....please seek help for if you didnt I dont think I would be here....and I have to be here for my 4 beautiful children.....and my 31 year old son is going through a divorce to and I need to support him through this...so thankyou everyone...talk soon.....Linda
