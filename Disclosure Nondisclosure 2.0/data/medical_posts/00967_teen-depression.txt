My husband and my daughter (his stepdaughter) are in dire need of help.  They are in such a constant state of turmoil that it seems everyone walks on eggshells at all times in my house.  She recently told me that now that she's 13, she would like to live with her Dad.  I CANNOT bear to lose her!  I'm signing us up for family counseling.  I just hope its not too late.  Of course I feel as if I'm in the middle of something I'll never win.  They always end up mad at me anyway and of course each one feels that I'm taking the other ones side.  We have a daughter, who's 6, and my older daughter sees her step father giving our little girl a lot of love and attention and she feels that she doesn't get anything but negative attention from him.  She's angry!  And, to be quite honest, I think he severely lacks in the loving department when it comes to showing love to my 13 year old.  We started dating when she was 3 years old and things were great between them until we had our daughter.  Things did change.  I just don't know what to do.  He feels that he's constantly being disrespected and she feels that he's always mean.  I see both of their points, possibly even more of my daughters point.  But, it's impossible to talk to him because he's instantly defensive and gets VERY angry.  Though he's not abusive, he does have a very short temper and that is scary.  I need help.  I feel like I'm losing my family!
