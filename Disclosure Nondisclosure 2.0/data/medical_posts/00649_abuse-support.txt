My last relationship was a disaster. We were in love til one day he decided to cheat on me with another woman that he told me about she was his ex. He wanted to be with us both.he wouldnt take a no for an answer. I refused this situation and decided to leave him and i told him wer over u can stay with the other one.he want crazy and mad he started threatening me he also said he would rape me,since i live in a country where girls rnt allow to lose their virginity before mariage,he offered to take my virginity away from me next time if he saw me..he even threatened me to hurt me and someone from my family..at that point i was so scared i dnt deny this fact,but i never let him win and take whatever he wanted. I, myself,threatened him that i would show all of his bad messages which contain all of his threatening words to the police and they will arrest him for that and throw him in jail if he just think about comming near me or anyone of my family..my story didnt take years of painful memories..it all happened in just one month.but i can assure u it was heck of a month i still have nightmares till now bcz of it. To all abused women out there dnt back down,the law is by ur side whatever he tries to do or say,be stronger than him and seek his weakness point and solve this prob ASAP cz the earlier u get rid of him ther best u can get ur life back..be courageous!
