Hello It all started over a year and a half ago one night I woke up out of a sleep and my whole body was numb I could not feel anything I stumbled to the bathroom and told my family to call 911 I thought I was dieing from a heart attack. They came right away about ten minutes later they checked my vitals I was fine I could start feeling again before they showed up and after that night I was never the same. I would go numb every once in a while and after a couple minutes come back around to feel again. I have been hit in the head several times in the past don't know if that has to do with anything but last November it got worse after someone hit me in the head for the tenth time I was ok for about a month then It keep getting worse.i am dizzy all day everyday I have pain behind my eyes and headaches and neck pain everyday it is hard to move my eyes side to side I get very dizzy easily I have chest pain and head pressure. If I don't keep it cool or the air conditioner on me and get ice I get more dizzy. I get short of breath now it's hard to just keep the chores up around the house. I feel like I'm not all there anymore like I'm slowly dieing. I have an irregular heart beat and get flutters a lot I was diagnosed with atrial fibleration of the heart. I have chest pains mostly after I eat and all day right between my rib cage connects in the middle right below my heart. The doctors did all kinds of tests can't find nothing except recently a doctor found out I am severly anemic my blood cell count is very low and he don't know why just yet more tests. I have taken the speed pills phentermine on and off in the past for weight loss I am not over weight now but I was before I took speed just wondering if it messed my heart valve up or if getting hit in the head so much caused my problems or something else more serious going on please anyone who could help or know something please let me know. Thanks
