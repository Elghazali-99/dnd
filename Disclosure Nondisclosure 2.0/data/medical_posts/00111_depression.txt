I've known all about the risks and i know a lot of people are gonna say get medical help immediately..
 Im just honestly reaching out 
Because i,have taken a lot of aspirin/tylenol l extra strength in the course of 31 hours.
 This honestly would be 4th suicide attempt 3 being an OD
 i went to the ER few days ago they didn't do a thing but hold me till i felt rdy to leave idk if because i didnt try anything or because i been admitted to two different clincs but still fighting my anexity and depression 
 Which now reading on how long an od of acetaminophen can take does make me worry and,could make matters worse
 I do fight with an chronic illness called crohns which can even be worse
 Idk really what im asking but reaching out for advice i want to seek help but after being dismissed so shorly ago raises my anexity and nervousnes to go back
 I,will say i have taken aboit 25 - 325mg nsaid aspirin within a 9 hour time yesterday and today its been about 12,000mg of acetaminophen tylenol extra strength over 6 hours time so far today.. so idk what to expect if anything
