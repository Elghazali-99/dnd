Okay...so I'm not having much luck finding an answer to my question about the effect of PCOS on perimenopause, and if that could possibly be at the root of a recent "illness" I've developed.  (I'm in my late 40s.)  (I guess I'll cross-post this in the PCOS forum, as well.)
 To simplify my question as much as possible, I'm wondering if I could be starting perimenopause, or if there's no way to know without monthly hormone tests, since I have PCOS?  In trying to figure it out on my own, I went back and gathered as much data as I could, concerning my menstrual cycles.
 From the time I was a teenager up until around age 40, I had 1-3 periods per year (although it would've varied, let's say 100 days or more between cycles).  (As I indicated, I have PCOS.)  Somewhere around 2005-2007, my periods suddenly BECAME regular...meaning, every month.  I've read that PCOS can have this effect on perimenopause (i.e. MAKING them become regular).  But, it seems as though there is scant research on this.
 I found my menstrual data going back to Dec. 2007.  Here are the durations between my periods, a year or two or three after they became monthly:
 Starting Dec. 04, 2007 - 41 days, (2008) 34, 36, 39, 33, 26, 30, 32, (2009) 32, 27, 32, 32, 31, 37, 32, 43, 30, 32, 28, 26, 31, 28, 30, (2010) 30, 31, 31, 29, 32, 31, 31, 27, 32, 28, 28, 21, (2011) 33, 27, 33, 27, 27, 28, 30, 28, 29, 28, 28, 29, 29, (2012) 29, 28, 27, 28, 27, 29, 26, 28, 29, 27, 25, 29, 27...
 For the most part, they seem to mostly fall into the 27-33 day range, at least as of late, with 21, 41, and 43 day outliers.  They are almost always 7 days long, with a few 8 day cycles here or there, and a few 5 or 6 day cycles thrown in for good measure.
 In any event, since Aug. 11, 2012, I've been experiencing a slew of uncomfortable (sometimes disconcerting) symptoms, incl. blurry vision/difficulty focusing, the feeling I'm about to lose consciousness, mild headaches and sometimes pressure, nausea, diarrhea, heart pounding, upper abdominal pain, fatigue, and more.  
 I am not having hot flashes or night sweats, nor do I have vaginal dryness or reduced libido.
 All tests, so far, have come back normal.  (CBC, EKG, blood cultures, stool analysis, 24hr Holter monitor, 2-week loop monitor, echocardiogram, manual breast exam, pelvic exam, thyroid test, and full physical.  I await the results of my PAP test, a breast ultrasound, a more comprehensive blood test, and a brain scan scheduled for January.)
 Sure wish I could figure out what's wrong with me.  The vision problems, headaches, and overall weirdness and discomfort make it difficult for me to drive, which is seriously impacting my life.  In addition, the occasional pain and fatigue can hamper my ability to do even simple tasks.  I'm not looking for a cause just for the sake of curiosity.  My life abruptly changed on Aug. 11, 2012, and hasn't been the same since.
