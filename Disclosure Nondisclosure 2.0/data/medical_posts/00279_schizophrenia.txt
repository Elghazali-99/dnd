If you have been diagnosed with schizophrenia or any other mental illness would you mind telling me whether you had anything traumatic happen when you were younger?You dont have to go into detail if you dont want im just wondering if theres more of a connection to schizophrenia being a psychological illness-that the psych has become this way due to an inability to integrate emotion/an experience which has been overwhelming and highly traumatising.
My theory is whether the neurobiological changes that appear on brain scans are more indicative of the way the neurochemistry has changed because of a reaction to something external rather then being assumed that the changes are "proof" that it has a genetic cause.
Also would you mind saying if anyone else in your family had a mental illness or if noone did.
I believe theres different types of things/illnesses that are being lumped into/called schizophrenia when i think in fact they have different causes(etiology or whatever) eg hearing voices might be due to temporal lobe epilepsy,a brain tumor,"true" schizophrenia etc but most psychiatrists(narrow minded ones) would just diagnose anyone that heard voices as having schizophrenia
Thanks for your help
