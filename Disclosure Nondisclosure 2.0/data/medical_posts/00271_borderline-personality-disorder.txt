I am a 42 year old female with many serious health problems. My mother lives with me, she is 64. I have my good days & bad days going through kidney failure, infections, etc. My question is when I am sick, in the hospital, or having bad times my mother is very nice to me. But when I am well & feeling good she is nasty, crabby & horrible to be around. She seems to thrive on the attention she gets at work, church, from friends when I am doing bad. Like she needs the attenion & sympathy. Needs people to tell her how sorry they feel for her & what she is going through. Needs a story for everyone, pitty you may call it. I dont understand it. I have heard that there is a medical term for this....people that need that type of attention & sympathy. Looks for emotional crisis's. If everything is good, she will come up will something bad like "oh my we are broke, dont know how we will buy food this week" or "They are going to shut the phone off" Why bring up the bad constantly?? Why thrive & look for things bad? And most of all.............Why want me to be sick for attention??  What is this called? 
Hope I have posted this correctly. 
Thank you
