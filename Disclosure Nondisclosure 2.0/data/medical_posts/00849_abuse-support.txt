My son has been w/the current babysitter for 1.5 years and he loves her to death.  She was also watching some kids next door (2 girls).  well, I believe the mom next door was the one who called Child Protective services on the babysitter alleging she threw my son over her head and acorss the room, she took showers with my son, etc.  My son went through the 1st interview at schoola dn they had concerns.  Now he is having to go through a special 2nd interview  with a forensic investigator and a detective.   I find it hard to belive she has done these things.  My son did deny being thrown across the room.  is it possible him being six, he gets mixed up with the questioning, etc.  Anyone else been thru this.  Also, now we are not using the babysitter b/c of this situation, have been advised not to return him to her.  It's just so much!!
 I also wonder if the mom next door is angry at the babysitter and she is being vindictive, but I htink they would have to question her girls as well, right???
