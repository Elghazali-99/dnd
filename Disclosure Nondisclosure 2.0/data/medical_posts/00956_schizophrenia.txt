Hi.  I am a schizophrenic male.  A while before I get schizophrenia, can't remember how long before.  This event occured.  It was somewhere between 2 months, and 5 years before, I got schizoprenia.  I was only a young teenager, and easily tricked at the time.  I smoked pot with someone who at the time was an enemy and hated me.  Later on I got schizophrenia.  I know some substances have been identified as causes of schizphrenia.  Over time I started with a small amount of paranoia, and gradually became more paranoid.  Then when I stopped sleeping I no longer was functional.  
 1 Could they have placed something in my mariuana, to give me schizophrenia?   Or  could they have placed something in my marijuana to give me an illness similar to schizophrenia?  Maybe I do not have schizophrenia but instead a similar illness from the laced marijuana?  
 2 If I go to the police about this, what information should I tell them to convince them to investigate this crime. 
 3 Where are some other places, I can ask other people about this? I would like to get multiple opinions.
