Hi my name is Nikki,
  I just wanted to give you my input on your situation....Last year in may, I experienced the same effects that you have. I had a large lump on my left clavicle bone, it felt like I had worked out too hard and it was sore. The lump was the size of a plum! It got to the point where I became seriously concerned about it. So I went to the doctor and had an MRI and a biopsy and they found a tumor that had created IN my clavicle bone causing the boe itself to shatter. At one point, the tumor specialist believed that I had cancer, but it just turned out to be a tumor A.K.A ABC. I underwent surgery and had the tumor removed immediatly. The doctors had to cut half of my clavicle bone off...but it did not effect any movement of my arm. It took me two weeks to recover, and know I have a minor scar on my left shoulder. I strongly suggest that you have your clavicle looked at, maybe you could save it before it could potentially shatter your bone....Good luck!  You can reach me at hawaii_208***@****This discussion is related to Lump on clavicle bone.
