Been married for 7 years, together for 10. My wife ask for me to give her some space. She is going thru a stage where she wants to hang out with her girl friends drinking and just having a good time. Just some background info. I work out of town and come home every other weekend. She has a teenager that has issues and is a hand full to say the least. Also know that she just had a hysterectomy 3 months ago. Before the surgery we had what I thought was a very good marriage. We did things together and had a lot of fun, love and laughter. I found out that one of her girlfriends is going around saying that they have the girl my wife used to be before we became a couple. I know she is not seeing someone else at this time but my fear is that by giving here the space she asked for and working out of town will lead her to finding someone else. She told me that where she is right know she would want a divorce. Should I be patient and trust her or move on? Again it has been 3 months. How long should I wait?
