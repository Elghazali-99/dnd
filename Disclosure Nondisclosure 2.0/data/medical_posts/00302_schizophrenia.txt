Hello,
 I recently turned 37 years old and I have begun to hear voices. The are not talking to me or at me, it's just sort of gibberish that lasts for a split second and then stops, sometimes it can be a tiny piece of a song I don't recognize as well. At first it only happened when I was falling asleep, now it happens occasionally during quiet moments. Is this Schizophrenia?
 There is no history of Schizophrenia in my family and at first I thought I was too old to show symptoms, but now I'm not sure.
 Let me fill you in on a few other things that are going on; I have been under a great deal of stress lately and have not been sleeping well. I'm having trouble keeping my mind focused, at some moments it feels like my thoughts are racing and at other moments, my mind just goes blank, I'm struggling for words and thoughts, I have trouble remembering simple things and most of my day I feel like I'm on autopilot, just kind of floating through my day physically while stuck in my own head over what could be wrong with me. 
 Physically, I'm exhausted but don't feel tired. I can fall asleep almost any time I relax but I cannot stay asleep for very long and will wake up several times an hour for a few seconds at a time.
 Am I just stressed out? Please help me, I need some answers.
