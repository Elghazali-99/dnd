what is your opinion or experience on the effects of pornography addiction and the partner? 
do you subscribe to the COSA 12 step "co-addiction" model, or trauma/PTSD 
due to the betrayal/lies? 
i am seeking PSTD treatment after having gone the 12 step route.  i don't buy into the co-addiction model after have spent over a year in COSA and doing some RCA work with my partner.  now, especially, since his addiction is so severe, he left me suddenly after disclosing that he will never be free of porn, and is tired of hiding and lying to me. i have a chronic illness which gave me a bad scare in my health, it was very traumatic for the both of us.  he couldn't handle it and succumbed to his addiction.   
i just want to recover from the shock and abandonment after having worked so hard and supporting him for a year and a half, with is addiction. 
 i see a lot of comments about women(mostly) who leave their partners after betrayal, but i see little about porn addicts who abandon their partners to act out in his/her addictions. 
 all comments welcomed, and i hope to post a new thread when i figure out how to. 
thank you
