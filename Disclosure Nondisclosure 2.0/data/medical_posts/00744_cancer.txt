I just had my first two rounds of chemo (stage 2b HER2 pos. breast cancer), as well as 6 rounds of Herceptin.  Every time I have any kind of treatment through my port I have this sensation of my chest and neck having pressure built up.  It's not very painful, but extremely uncomfortable.  And it is getting worse.  It is not so bad after just the Herceptin treatments, but it still happens.  I talked to my doctor and they think it Is an allergic reaction to the chemo, but of course they wont stop the chemo.  I even spent some time in the ER because the pressure got so bad that we were trying to rule out a heart attack and/or a blood clot in my lung, which I was showing all the symptoms for, such as a cough and a hoarse voice on top of the pressure.  But all tests were negative.  
It is now time for round 3 (out of 6, every three weeks) and I still have intense pressure in my neck at this time.  I am worried that things will just get much worse if nobody can figure out what this is all about.  
I also thought it might be superior vena cava syndrome, but my port is fine and easily accessible. So apparently that's not it either.  Any ideas?  Anyone else ever had that problem?  Please help.
