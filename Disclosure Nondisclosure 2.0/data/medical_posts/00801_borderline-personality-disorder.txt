I not sure if this is the right place for this, but I think it fits best. Basically very often I feel like I'm disconnected. Like things don't line up right. I have no idea how to truly explain this but I will try as best I can. 
 Often I feel like I'm constantly disassociated with....well reality I guess. It's like my world has shrunk immensely. I move from being on my computer to playing an instrument and then walking around the house only to return to my room, feeling like I'm trapped. I get stuck in this cycle and nothing seems to exist except trying to occupy myself. I can just blank out for what seems like hours only to find it has been mere minutes. I feel like I experience time dilation.
 Lately I just feel so apathetic or just that nothing matters, as if politics could not even ever matter to me, because they cannot effect my life. 
 When I try to think it's just nothing.
 Sometimes I just sit indian style and lean forward onto the ground and just lie like that for days in my head, only for really an hour or so.
 I don't know how to explain what exactly it is that I'm feeling. This is the best that I can think of.
 I feel like there is such a big world out there with so much in it. I just cant find it. 
 Thanks for reading and for your time.
