Im new here and I am hoping that someone can shed some light on what this is...
I remember when I was younger, like maybe in my early teens that when i was doing something that required focus, if it was quiet and I was alone, I would get a very strange "head vibration...if that makes sense. It would slowly build up and up and up and spread to my entire body, almost like i was in a dream or disconnected from myself. I couldn't take this weird feeling anymore and would try to find something to take my mind off it so it would stop. The feeling is almost impossible to describe...a hum/buzz that is defening at the peak.
Almost always only when there was near silence an I for example was installing a stereo deck in my car, it took focus and it seemed like that was the trigger.
I don't get them as often, maybe 1 a year now but as a teenager it was much more frequent.
I also remember as a small child having to plug my ears when I would try to fall asleep so I wouldn't hear the low whisper of a voice/voices saying my name repeatedly. I am not schizophrenic or bi-polar although i do have highs and lows a lot. I am not diagnosed but if you looked up the symptoms of borderline personality disorder, it would look like a description of myself to a T except for the sexual abuse aspect.
I always feel down, always upset and sleep a lot, can't get motivation or drive to do anything, I've lost many jobs because I seem lazy, but i am nit, I am depressed. I take 300mg welbutrin, .05mg of synthroid, .03mg of clonidine. I have chronic pain and am taking hydromorph contin 12mg, 2x a day.
The only time I even remotely feel "normal" is when my pain meds kick in. I know ppl will say that of course you feel better, your high....no, I do not get high from my pain meds. Is there a medication that works on dopamine? Its almost like I don't have enough natural hormones to make me feel normal, when i take the pain meds, i feel like I did before I was depressed, not high, just normal...help anyone?
