Hi,
I've been diagnosed with a debilitating case of mixed anxiety/depression disorder. My psychiatrist had initially prescribed 
risperidone 0.5mg (off-label use as anxiolytic) and Prozac. However, after using this combo for a month, my panic attacks have worsened, and I actually have to use Clonazepam SOS for severe attacks. My psychiatrist has now asked me to start on Zyprexa 2.5mg and Sertraline 50mg. My questions are:
1. Although I do not have schizophrenia, why am I constantly being prescribed antipsychotics as off-label anxiolytics?
2. Is it true that zyprexa and risperidone can induce schizophrenia if a non-schizophrenic person uses them?
3. Should I insist on a non-antipsychotic antipanic agent?
4. How risky is the use of Clonazepam (I use 0.75mg thru'out the course of the day, later to be reduced to 0.5 and then 0.25mg) as a SOS anxiolytic?
Will someone please help me on this? I can't keep on bugging my psychiatrist, and my panic attacks are so bad sometimes that I feel I am being tortured. My parents are worried sick as well.
