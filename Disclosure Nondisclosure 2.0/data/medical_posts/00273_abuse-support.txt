Im 18 years old this is my 2nd pregnancy, i lost my first pregnancy due to a miscarriage.. Sometimes i feel like maybe it wasnt just that i being emotionally abused and physically.. I feel like from all the constant crying, hitting, and everything had a little something to do with it but i dont know i was 9weeks when i lost it. Now im pregnant again im 11weeks and 2days.. Today my partner got mad because i didnt want the dog in the bedroom he smells and is making messes.. So i put him back in hes room and told my partner to not bring him in our bedroom he got mad started calling me names and pulled me by hair nd pushed me towards the wall and was choking me knowing im pregnant and i basically have marks on my neck and stuff im scared at times and i do get so sick of it and want to leave but its hard i love him but not what hes become.. Ive been abused, raped, and everything when i was younger he knowz it but its like whatever i didnt think my life would get any worse..... Sometimes i feel like you know.. But dont have the guts too  i want someone to talk too and give me advise and help please.
