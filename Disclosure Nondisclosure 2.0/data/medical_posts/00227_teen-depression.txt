I really dont know what to do with my life anymore...from the start, i never really had much self confidence. Im a freshman in high school and all my friends would laugh at me when i try to belong with them, and if i be smart, im labeles as 'the nerdy one who doesnt have fun' but if i dont im called 'the stupid girl'. i dont even have a family to help me with this. my father keeps telling me that he thinks depression is stupid and pointless and he never thinks i will do it. No body will give me a second glance cuz i look very happy on the outside. This is also why if i tell my friends they will think i just want attention. But my parents dont really care about me, they dont know what im going through and i cant tell them, i cant explain. it doesnt help that they always call me stupid and worthless, and that i wouldn't get anywhere in life. Then my dad starts yelling at me saying that if i go on like this there is no point of living, and i dont think he knows how correct he is. I really have no purpose in this world. i dont know why im writing this, probably to help the other teens out there-if you think you got it bad, your not alone. I am a victim of self-harm and ive been thinking a lot about suicide...but im scared. im a scared little weak useless human, a waste of time and space.
