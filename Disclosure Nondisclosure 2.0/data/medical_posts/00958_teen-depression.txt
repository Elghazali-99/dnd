I am 16.  I feel so incredibly stuck.  I hate that its summer.  I have basically no friends and NOTHING to do.  I just sit at home alone.  Both my sisters are away, my mom has a lot of work to do and my dad is always at work.  I just want to sleep all day.  I can't think anymore, it hurts too much.  I have been drained of all my energy and from that I hate myself.  I feel like a failure because I know I am a person that is so determined and happy but that person died.  I have been lead to so much disappointment in my life as a result of incredibly hard work I have put into everything I do and it never pays off.  It makes me feel like a loser and that nothing can ever happen for me.  When I think about it I am amazed by how much fate hates me.  I sound so angsty but its how I feel and I can't help but feel stuck.  I want to be able to move on and be strong but I have no more energy.  I feel like such a loser.  Also my dad is thinking about moving across the country which would be great because it would be to somewhere I would love but I doubt it will happen because anything that would be good for me, wont happen.  Also my parents won't let me go on a trip that I am dying to go on because they don't want to be responsible if something happens.  
 I just need some kind of light at the end of the tunnel
