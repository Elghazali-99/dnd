Hey can someone please help me?? This all started on March 12th when I noticed my neck felt funny.. so I rubbed the back of my head right over top of the neck where it meats the head .. I notice I had a knot there. So I really paid it no mind until a few days later it didn't go away.. so I started to get a lil worried and started checking my neck and head for knots  about a 3-4 days later I notice a knot in my neck so I mad a doctor's appointment. The doctor told me she thinks it's a knotted muscle and just give if a few weeks, she went on to ask questions if I been bitten or pulled a muscle I told her I don't think so.. so I let a week go by and the knot stil didn't go away .. so I started to research on the internet to see what it might be everything kept coming up as cancer.. so I went back and told her I'm scared it's cancer!! She still didn't seem to concerned , she asked me did I stress a lot and ever had anxiety I told her yes but I don't believe this is all caused by anxiety.. so she ordered a ultra sound for me.. before my ultrasound appointment my face started to go numb on left side my ears started to feel plugged and like they need to pop.. so I got the ultrasound and they said they saw to little lymph nodes on each sides and thats it's normal.. my glandes on each side was different I think one side was like 2cm and other was 4cm but they said your body is different on each side
