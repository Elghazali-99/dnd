Ever feel like you are losing control of your future? I am surprised I have not seen a related post to job / career based anxiety. I feel like I am in a losing battle with constant anxiety over my economic future. This change in the economy *****. I have a job again, but its the most stressful job I ever had with the worst, most stressful jerk of a boss possible. Everyone hates this man, for a reason. My thoughts are consumed with the stress and anxiety this man causes me.
 I cant seem find anything better as my field of work has shrunk. So I look and wait everyday. People say I am lucky to be employed, since I seem to be a victim of company downsizing every three years. OK. But I feel like I'm on the edge of going crazy. Dont see much to look forward to anymore. Changing field of work is economically not possible at this time for me, I have a mortgage to pay.
 So I have to learn to deal with this evil work environment for I dont know how long. I hate living this way. I want to enjoy life again, but dont know how anymore. Any good books or web sites that will help me deal with an a_ _ hole boss?  I try to exercise, but stress itself makes exercise painful some times - I get sore from stress. I take st johns wart - seems to do nothing for me. Valarian root helps for sleep a little bit. I know many are now in this situation. Five years ago I took Zoloft for this same thing- I didn't like it, it turned me into an emotionless droid - My sense of humor went totally away and that is the only thing that keeps me sane. I dont want prescriptions.
 I appreciate any ideas, as doing nothing has the same results.
