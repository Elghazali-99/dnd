I am a 54 year old woman.  Three years ago my boyfriend called me at work and I was in a meeting.  When I got out, I returned the call and he didn't answer.  Then I texted him and he didn't answer.  I waited an hour and called him again with no answer.  This was all highly unusual.  On my lunch I ran home to see if everything was ok, but at the same time fearing the worst.  When I arrived at home, much to my horror, I found him dead in our bed - ,y worst fear.
 I have gotten over that as much as a person can and moved on to a new relationship with someone that I hope to send the rest of my life with.  We have been together for a year and a half and it is a long distance relationship for now.  When I haven't heard from him, or he hasn't answered his phone or texted me back, I immediately fear the worst again, because the worst has already happened to me.  I go into a full fledged panic attack, hyperventilating, breaking out in a cold sweat, sobbing so hard I can't breathe, shaking uncontrollably, etc.  I can't even drive the car.  
 I know that the chances of something bad happening again are probably low, but because of my history I can't help it.  When we first got together, I told him that this was the only baggage that I would bring to the relationship, and he has been great about it and gotten better at staying in touch.  He is moving here now and going back to see his kids every other weekend, so it doesn't happen as much, but now it happens easier than before.  I hate that this happens....  Can anyone relate to such a difficult situation?
