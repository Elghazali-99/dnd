I'm 13 and I think I'm depressed. Ever since 2 years ago everything feels like I'm just watching and can't do anything even with my family. I always feel tired, I feel like crying half the time for no reason, and as my friend said its like I'm in my own world and that I need to open up and talk more. My friends have tried to help and I try to let them but before they can help I trick them into thinking I'm ok when I'm really not. I know I need to talk to someone I trust but I really don't trust anyone. I don't trust my mom because she found out from a spoused to be good friend that I thought I was worthless and thought the world would be a better place without me and the look on my mom's face just stopped me and caused me to trick her too. I don't really know any trusted adults because they will tell my mom. And all my friends (not including two) would judge me and put me down even more. And both of the two friends I can't talk to because they don't have a phone or live anywhere near me.  I mean it was hard for me to just post this. Pretty much I don't want to disappoint my family because they think I'm a little angle.
 I always feel lost and worthless. People have tried to help but then they forget all about me and it just makes me feel even more worthless. And when it comes to making a choice of what's my favorite my only choice is IDK because I don't even know what I like anymore.
 I don't know what to do or who I can trust.
