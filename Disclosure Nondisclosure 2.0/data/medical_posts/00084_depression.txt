This is kind of long but Ima make it brief, Ive been molested, raped, my ex use to slapped me, had 2 kids by two different men cause they were both no good, in between them tried dating other men but all they wanted was sex and not a relationship, and I wasn't ready for kids but took on my responsibilities and provided food, shelter, and clothes for them both, finished high school with honors and college, right when I finished college I thought everything was starting to fall in place I was in another bad relationship that was off and on for 3 years, I knew he was cheating but I didn't want to continue to be alone, but look at me now I got what I deserved one night of passion do cause a lifetime of pain, he ended up leaving me and my kids for 6 months to go stay with another woman, in that time I figured I should make plans to get with someone else since he wasn't coming back but I made the worst mistake ever I got careless and contracted 3 std's between the both of them 2 were curable but one wasn't, and it was HSV1 & HSV2, its been since April and I still haven't gotten over it and don't know if I will, Im spiraling out of control everything makes me upset and Im angry and want to scream and haven't been able to sleep correctly for years, I hollering at the kids throwing and busting up stuff hitting myself telling myself Im ugly when people clam im gorgeous, im pretty, but I don't see that, I haven't been able to love myself and im trying to get counseling cause I don't want to hurt myself or others. I just want to kill the both of them but I cant go to jail nor be away from my kids, Ive been going to church and praying but I just don't know what to do anymore, Somebody please Im begging ya Help Me Get Back on Track, I don't want to lose everything!
