There is decrease in the size of previously seen heterogeneously enhancing mass in right upper alveolus 
extending into right upper gingivobuccal sulcus and buccal mucosa measuring approximately 3.4 x 1.7 x 3.2 
cm (previous 7 x 2.5 x 3.5 cm).
Posteriorly it involves the upper aspect of the right retromolar trigone with extension into masticator space 
showing loss of fat planes with temporalis, medial pterygoid and masseter muscles. The lesion creeps along 
the retroantral space into right low anterior ITF. Medially the fat planes with the lateral border of tongue is 
lost.
There is erosion of outer cortex of maxillary alveolus.
The mandible appears intact.
The high ITF is free of disease.
Few subcm sized lymph nodes are seen in right level II and bilateral level Ib.
No suspicious enlarged 
 necrotic nodes are seen.
The rest of the oral cavity appears unremarkable
The naso-oropharynx , larynx and trachea appears normal.
The parotid and submandibular glands appear normal.
The thyroid gland is unremarkable.
The orbits, mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable.
 CT reveals 
:
-Decrease in the size and extent of previously seen heterogeneously enhancing mass in right upper alveolar 
region as described.
Subcm level II and Ib nodes.
