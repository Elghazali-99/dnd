I am 17 years old, female, and a junior in HighSchool. I've been struggling with depression for a few years, but recently it's gotten unmanageable. I have now developed severe anxiety and I am missing a lot of school. The worst part is... No one is missing me. All my friends have stopped texting me and even stopped responding when I text them. My best friend told me he wants nothing to do with me. I have a brother the same age as me and a 14 year old sister that both go to my HighSchool. They are both very confident and very popular. It's so hard to be the way I am and watch them live amazing and happy lives. I cry myself to sleep every night. I try to go to social events, but I can never make any friends that want to talk to me outside of that event or school. I'm so depressed I'm becoming physically I'll and I don't know what to do. I'm very self conscious, but not really shy. I love meeting new people, they just never stick around. I have a therapist, but it's not helping. I'm so scared and alone. I can't even fathom moving out of state for my college degree next year. Does anyone have any advice? Please help me.
