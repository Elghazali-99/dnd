These lumps developed in my neck over 18 years ago after a very serious medical problems (i died 2's). For many of the last 18 years I have seen Dr. after Dr. for these lumps and I was always told :nothing to worry about". The last couple of years they developed hard lumps in each side. They interfere with ROM of my head and neck. They swell so badly sometimes that i can barely breathe. Pills and foods get stuck in my throat for hours sometimes. I have even had my throat stretched to help this problem to no avail. 
It is almost impossible to turn my head completely to one side or the other... I cant lift my arms above my head. I have sooooo many other problems going on as well. IBS, Irratable bladder, chronic fatigue, Fibro, Breast lump problems, Heart problems, diverticulosis of both the bowel and bladder, massive sikin cancer, foot/feet problems, joint and muscle pain, massive muscle spasams. I could go on and on. 
How do I find a Dr. that is willing to do more than just manipulate them and tell me there is nothing to worry about! 
When they first began they were rubbery and ached allot, now the last 2-3 years they developed this lumps inside.
The Dr's see me wince, flinch, pull away from the pain when they are examining them but, yet.... they dont LISTEN!
I have been called a mystery, and an ignigma so many times i hope I never hear that word again! 
One Dr. did do a blood test which showed high levels in my liver. But then nothing was done! 
I live in the states/Fl. does anyone know of a facility that might be interested in finding out what these are? 
I lost my insurance in Jan 07 after carrying it for 20 years. It was either keep the insurance or save our home of 20 years. We chose our home. 
Is there a test i can buy online that will give me some insigtht into these things. I have tried for 18 years to have these things taken care of and everyone keeps passing the buck! The buck stops here.
