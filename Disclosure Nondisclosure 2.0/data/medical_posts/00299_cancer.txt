I am a 34 year old male. About 3 months ago I noticed a lump in my left armpit, it was only noticeable to the touch, not visible. At that time, it was round, about the size of a nickle, and hard, but did not hurt. I ignored it because my family had been sick, and I figured swollen lymph node. 
 I also have dropped about 30 lbs without any significant effort in the last 6 months, not sure if this is related, but a data point. 
 I saw my PCP about 2 weeks ago. He ordered a round of bloodwork as well as an ultrasound. He also referred me to a general surgeon after the ultrasound was complete. 
 The bloodwork came back mostly normal. The exception was the MCHC was 2.4 below normal range. Also, MCV was 0.4 above normal range. 
 I just received the ultrasound results. Here's the gist of the report: There are three hypoechoic regions extending from the skin toward the deep axillary tissues progressively increasing in size superficially to deep. Superficially a 4 mm x 3 mm hypoechoic region is seen. In the deep tissues a 7x 7 mm hypoechoic region is identified. There is some color-flow associated with the more proximal superficial lesion. These do not have imaging characteristics typical of cyst or lymph node. An unusual neurogenic tumor can conceivably have this appearance. I doubt that this represents an inflammatory mass.
 Over the last 5 days or so, the underarm area has increasing become tender and bothersome. I still wouldn't label it as painful, but it's definitely sore. Also, last night I found another lump, not nearly as big, just above the first rib in the same side that is tender to the touch.
 Does anyone have any insight on this kind of thing? My wife and I are a little worried and trying to find out if we have any reason to be. 
 Thanks!
