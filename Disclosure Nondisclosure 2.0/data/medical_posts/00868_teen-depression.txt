My boyfriend of almost a year is suicidal. Before we were together he was my best friend for 3 years. 
When we started dating, I was depressed (not as badly as him but pretty bad), and he helped me through it. Now I am a year abroad and he is talking about suicide and depression and how he's not worth anything. He says he has no happiness. I tell him that I will kill myself if he harms himself and to think about me and not be stupid. I am away on a very prestigious scholarship, but he wants me to come home to be with him. The original plan was for him to come here, but in the past week, he changed his mind completely saying he doesn't have the energy or motivation and that it's not worth it to come.... But he wants me home because that's where it all started. He wanted to propose to me this year (within the next few months). Every time I mention him coming he gets upset and starts trying to leave me. Over the smallest of things he tries to leave me, but cries and apologizes and begs for us to be together an hour later. This is really draining me and dragging me into a state of depression as well. I've told him to pull himself together but he just says he's failed me and tells me to leave him. I love this guy.... And I can't leave him. Even if this is unhealthy for me.
Please help me. I really need advice.
