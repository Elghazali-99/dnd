Im a 17 year old gay guy and I'm finding it really hard to cope with life, I have hardly any friends and I find it hard to fit in Because I have low self esteem issues and Im not into the popular culture of today, finding a partner is really hard and stressful for me and I cry a lot Because I believe I will be lonely forever. I try to find new partners all the time using Facebook and other sociol networks, I keep arranging to meet up with boys and I trust them Because I know they are there for the same reason as I am and also I am more careful about weather someone is really who they say they are Because I video chat or phone them, anyway, I have met a couple of boys I really like, but I always get so paranoid as to wether they like me or not despite the fact they say they do, also I always try to organise dates where we can meet but it either gets cancelled or my social phobia stops me from doing so, the worst part is my paranoia towards them, i feel it agitates them and they get put off, I just don't know what to do, my life was onnce so full of joy and I always used to be happy, now I feel like I've lost everything, I don't know what to do
