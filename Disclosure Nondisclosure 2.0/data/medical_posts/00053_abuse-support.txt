Hey guys,
 So i have been dating this girl for around four months, and recently she informed me of a horrible thing that happened with her father.
 Apparently she came home intoxicated one night, and her father had just decided right there to force her into sex. She was unconscious for a while, but woke up telling him to stop. 
 Now i couldnt find one thing wrong with this girl, she is great. Nice, funny, beautiful, caring. 
 The wierdest part is that this whole thing really doesnt seem to bother her too much. I mean she is really a normal girl, does good in school (university), and doesnt have any problem being involved in sexual stuff with me. I can't understand it. I feel it was more devastating for me to hear this than for her to tell it. She still lives with her father and her family, who does well, and claims that he only did this once (not too long ago that is).
 I am just really confused. She was honest enough to admit this to me (I am only the 2nd person to know besides one of her friends), so i feel that she would be honest enough to tell me that it affects our relationship, and it really doesnt seem to bother her anymore. It scares the crap out of me when she goes home to her family, because she still lives with this pervert. She was not a minor when this happened, so maybe the normal effects of an incest situation did not affect her like it would have normally effected a young minor??
 I really need some help understanding this. We are going to talk more about it soon, once I am able to see her in person again (tomorrow), but I just need to insight. I mean she was still disgusted by the incident, felt very violated, and has a hard time talking about it and doesnt get along with him at all, but it really just doesnt seem to effect her everyday life like it would effect somebody else.
 I am also very worried that this might happen again, but I dont know what to do since she hasnt told anybody. 
 thanks a ton.
