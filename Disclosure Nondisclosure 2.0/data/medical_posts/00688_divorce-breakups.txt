So with a divorce in place, and were about 4 months from the divorce being finalized, my husband has been holding the divorce over my head, and says if he sees changes in me and our relationship, he might stop the divorce and we can be together again. He has been so nasty and mean to me since he filed for divorce. He's a completely different person. We don't have any contact and he stopped wearing his ring and started buying new clothes, I suspect that their is somebody else. I told him this week in counseling that I'm done, I'm walking away. I'm not doing things his way anymore! He had the nerve to tell me that I'm giving up on our marriage and I'm emotionally abondoning our relationship! He's the one that filed for divorce and moved out, but it's my fault when I won't work on our relationship while a divorce is in place, but according to him, it's my fault! And earlier this week, he took off his ring but I noticed when we were sitting in marriage counseling, it was back on his finger again! This is a game to him, he wants to put the blame on me and he wants to make him self look good! Oh yeah, and he tried to bail out of counseling this week, and when I told him that I was still going to meet with the counselor, he was like oh, let me see what I can do, and he texted me later and said, good news, I will be at counseling! He wants to paint this picture that he's trying to save the marriage, and everything is for show!
