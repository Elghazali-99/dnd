It is 3 months since I found out my husband of 30 years not in love with me anymore but he stills loves me......and his 22year old girlfriend.....I have moved out of the town he lives in and I must say to everyone that not seeing him is the best thing...I still think of him about not much now....I still have down days but no more dark days.....so life does go on and you do survive.....I have been excepted in university to study law and my kids and I are growing closer and closer together....things are moving on......no closer to getting any of my money off him and he is still playing games but he has to play with my lawyer....it is my first divorce and the ladies on here gave me some good advice so if this has happened to you......you will feel lost and it will seem like nothing matters then I prayed and vented a lot of angry and all sorts of emotions on here......and you beautiful people listened so thanks......he still hates me and still put me down a lot to the kids.....but they just dont see him anymore......and I do not put him down in front of the kids or on facebook......he has nothing on me....he has damaged his relationship with his kids on his own....I still dont understand why this happened and really now I dont care.....so if you have been through this then  DO NOT SEE HIM OR HER...yes it is hard....dont take his calls dont text him and this will help you move on....I am not saying I am wonderful but I am a lot better and my emotions are still over the place but now I can focus on work, gym and children.....and for the moment that is all I need....I dont date I am not ready for that...even though I have been asked a lot......so I hope some of this helps you and please feel free to talk to me if you need to....I wouldnt of made it without the support and love from this site.
