My psychiatrist of 13 years has decided that she can no longer treat me. I have bpd and the typical fear of abandonment. I know this lady is my doctor but after 13 years it just feels like she has given up on me and that she can't adequately support me as she does not have the capacity in her work load. I have lots of bad feelings about this and I know I'm not going to be able to handle it when the time comes. She has been a fantastic support to me over the years but I just don't understand why she is doing this all of a sudden. It's not as if she even has a new job. I just feel like she used to really care about me and now she doesn't. Other people say it's unfair for me to say that as she is only doing it for my beat interests but I'm just so angry and hurt about it all. The feelings I have re. it are so intense that I can't even discuss it with anyone without crying like a baby. Part of me says I should just not see her again and get it over and done with, but I know I can't do it. Does anyone have any advice that would make this any easier?
