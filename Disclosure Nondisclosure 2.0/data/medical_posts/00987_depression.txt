Ive been doing a lot of thinking lately about my relationship or lack there of with my dad. Ive always tried to earn his love and attention but i feel like ive never gotten it. As a teenager i coped with anorexia, depression and extreme social anxiety which was only fueled more when id visit my dad and hed call me lazy because i didnt want to go outside and play. Im going to be 27 this coming month and to this day he cant remember the year i was born. I feel like a horrible person because i resent him for not being there for me but i also blame myself because i was apparently never deserving of his love. I have a half brother who is 10 years younger than me and has always gotten all of my dads love and attention, im so extremely jealous of that and because of the jealousy im not close with him at all. Ive been considering writing my dad a letter and pretty much telling him how i feel and cutting ties with him, although i know if i do that ill be the horrible person. All ive ever wanted is to be daddys little girl and i have never had that. My mom who has always been there for me thinks i shouldn't worry about it at all and just let it be, but i feel so unwanted and i just want to know why he never wanted to be around me and why i could never make him proud. I just need to know if writing him a letter to get closure is a good idea. Has anyone else dealt with something like this?
