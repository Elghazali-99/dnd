Hello first of all i don't really like telling people about my feelings but i really need to know. Basically i had a head injury when i was 5 my head sort of cracked but they fixed it. Now i'm 14 and i really need to get rid of them, I hear these little voices telling me what i should and shouldn't do there names are Bethan, Dean & Kita. I'm scared for my life i'm really scared because i can't stop thinking about death suicide or hurting other people. I feel that aliens are controlling me or it's them who knows. I avoid everything dirty if i go near or touch somthing dirty I will scream. At night I get these sort of auditorial things like i will hear screaming, running foot steps, gun shots, and voices crying saying ''Please don't hurt me please!'' Somtimes i smell burning. I feel like the news on t.v knows how i think & feel. Somtimes i wonder why i'm so aggressive and violent my mood changes every 30 minutes, I've been to a mental health unit once. The psychiatric doctors are looking at Schizophrenia but i think there is nothing wrong with me but i just need to know just incase. So do you have a suggestion? xxx
