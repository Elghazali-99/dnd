I had breast cancer w chemo, xrt, & now tamoxifen. The toamoxifen limits the antidepressants I can take. When I first exp depression my onc put me on Remeron as I had lost a lot of weight with chemo. It made me feel better quit quickly but piled on the weight (my norm is 112#). So when I was at 130# I said please something else. Long story short I have tried: Effexor, celexa, lexapro (these had me suicidal within 3d. I was much much worse than I had ever been). She ref me to a psych. He tried viibryd & fetzima (same response). He tried nortriptyline but I couldnt tol the side effects. I'm back on remeron & basically not eating so I don't gain weight; it's torture. Every time I get of remeron I easily go back to my baseline so I've ruled out tamoxifen. I took serzone as a teen which worked well. Took it about a year, weaned off, never had depression again til now. My PD said we could try serzone. Does it act similarly to remeron? Is it THAT dangerous? My depression is dangerous as well as weight gain has been shown to increase breast cancer recurrence. Also, I'd like to not have to starve myself. Thanks for any info
