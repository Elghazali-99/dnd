I am 16 years old.
 For the past few weeks I have been bleeding from the vagina (spotting)...it's not like a period. When I put a tampon in, when it comes out it's clean except for one spot on the side has a fair bit of blood on it.
 I decided to check it out myself and manually felt in my vagina with a finger (yes I basically fingered myself but for research purposes) and felt a LUMP!! I'd say it's at the upper third or very top of the vaginal canal. I have felt up there before and I know that it absolutely was NOT there 3 weeks ago.
 I have also been experiencing a bit of constipation, but not serious. Just slightly strenuous bowel movements, though nothing extremely bothersome. 
 I have already scheduled an obgyn appointment but I was hoping for some background from people who have had experience with vaginal cancer. Or could it be cervical cancer? 
 I am so, so, so scared. I am mentally way too immature to be able to come to terms with having cancer. Even a comment from somebody who has beat cancer or has come to terms with it will help. Thank you so much
