I have been married to my wife for 15 years and we have been together for eight year prior to the wedding. The relationship was good and we had a child nine years ago, since our child was born we only had sex one time, we have not had any sexual contact for the past seven years. I was always the one to initiate, even if it was a kiss goodbye for the day,if I didn't start it, it didn't happen. About two years ago I found out she was going for counseling do to her step father molesting her and she said that I remind her of him physically, and then one day she just quit going to therapy. Needless to say nothing in the relationship changed, we don't even give kisses good night or goodbye. I feel that we are simply room mates and I tell her that and she says that I'm over reacting. One day she was checking out some guy and making comments about him being hot and I simply said " Yeah but I wonder how long he would last in this relationship with no signs of any affection" and told her she should be thankful that I have stayed not only loyal to her but to stay in the relationship period. I was just curious on what other people think of this situation and what would they do if they were in my shoes. I do feel bad for what has happened to her but if she isn't doing anything to help herself what am I supposed to do. If I suggest counseling she laughs it of and says that we are fine and their is nothing wrong with our relationship.
