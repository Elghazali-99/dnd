Hi. I'm 18, and I've been on a birth control called lutera for almost 2 and a half years now. I don't have any complaints or a problems. But I do have a very big situation.
My boyfriend of 2 and a half years and I have always tried to be as cautious as possible when it comes to ways to prevent pregnancy. Like me being on birth control, and if I've taken antibiotics, no unprotected sex for an entire pack, and then not even having sex a full week into the next pack after the month I took the antibiotics. 
Well last night, I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend. And no, I don't have to worry about STD's, we've lost our virginities to each other and have stayed loyal and faithful to each other this entire time. 
But anyways, we had sex, and he pulled out because it helps me to not freak out about having children. I know, it's stupid. But still, it's worked so far.
Anyways, when he pulled out, some of his sperm dripped down to my vagina. And I wasn't freaking out too bad, except I got extremely sick last night and was unable to take my birth control pill until this morning.
I have never been more than an hour late on my pill before. EVER. I need to know if I will have to watch out for pregnancy more than ever, or if I just continue to take my pills exactly on time I will be fine? Please help me someone. I honestly can't handle having a kid right now. Please help.
