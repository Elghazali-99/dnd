I don't know where to start but here it goes.. Ok so my mom uses meth, and I found out when I was about 14 years old and now I'm 21. So my mom has been calling me every name in the book ever since then.. But recently in the past two years she has physically hurt me over nothing she punched on me thanksgiving last year and I just pushed her off of me cause I was in shock that she would actually strike me...and we didn't talk for a while and she came to me one day and apologized to me saying I'm sorry I'll never hit you again and I said ok mom. So then couple weeks ago I was cleaning up the house and I'm picking up after my mom, her boyfriend and her 3 kids and I asked her kindly, hey mom can you please help me clean up I'm gonna have a guest over and most of the stuff that I'm picking up is yours. She replied with ***** if you don't like it you can get the **** out of my house and I said ok mom I didn't come at you foul so don't come at me like that. She came out of her room and said ***** don't talke back to me I told you if you don't like it get out! I was like look mom I'm a little to old for you to be coming at me all crazy when I asked you a simple question..she got in my face and pushed me and said ***** I'm going to **** you up! And I swore to myself that will she lay hands on me again and gets away with it I'm going to defend myself this time.. She pushed me once more and she punched me .. I had no choice but to defend myself and I did... It felt weird to actually fight back but I had no choice...so I got off of her and she was like ***** your dead to me **** you ! Your going to see what it's like to be without a family...mind you my dad is a deadbeat father never around.. My mom is all I have even though she strikes me and always emotionally abuses me like I can't believe that's my mom I thought a mother is to love and protect and nurture but she did the exact opposite,anyways that week I moved in with my boyfriend and I'm surrounded by love and support and a good healthy environment but I'm still hurt by all that my mom has done to me..I can honestly say I'm mentally ****** up.. Help me please.. I just want to recover from my past and move on but it's really hard to..
