I am a 61-year old woman who had a hysterectomy at age 40 but my ovaries were left intact.  Since I no longer had a period after that, it was difficult to determine exactly when menopause started.  My doctor put me on HRT at age 48.  I took those for 7 years and then decided to stop after all the negative reports about HRTs came out.  Once I stopped the HRTs, I started with very severe hot flashes and night sweats.  This has gone on for almost 7 years now and while their severity has lessened some, I still experience hot flashes at least once an hour during the daytime and every 20-30 minutes at night.  I have tried all the soy-based products, black cohosh and a prescription drug for blood pressure that my doctor said may help with hot flashes but none of them had any effect at all.  After 7 years of hot flashes 24/7, I am at my wit's end.  The only remedy my doctor has for me is to start back on HRTs which I don't want to do.  Has anyone had this experience of hot flashes for such a long time and is there any hope they will stop anytime soon?
