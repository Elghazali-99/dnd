I am with the love of my love life, We've been best friends for over 20 years, we have been married going on 6 years. We have a son who will be 4 in April. We have had the worse year ever he lost his job last Jan. and everything went downhill fast since then.... as of now we have no income at all coming in. I am a stay at home mom it took me 10 years to get pregnant and finally did after we stopped trying it happened 2 weeks after I graduated from collage and it was a high risk so I never went to work in my major. So I've been looking for work to no avail :O( over the past year my husband changed and turned into someone I didn't know and I found out it was due to drugs and since I found out he has gone to detox, joined a methadone program but he's just getting worse and I've done my best to hide it from our son. The past 2 months I've kicked  him out twice but let him back because of the man he used to be and he gave me promises and his word he would stop and yes I wanted to believe him. But now I have told him it's rehab or divorce? My question is to you guys is how do I help my son deal with his daddy leaving either way? All he knows is that's my daddy, he can do no wrong, I love him, he's my best friend! He is a great dad but the drugs are starting to get the best of him and he is in complete denial at this point??
Please Help!!!
