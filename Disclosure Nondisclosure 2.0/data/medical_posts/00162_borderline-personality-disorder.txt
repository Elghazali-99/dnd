What if all the bad stuff people say about bpd is true what if we are all liars, attention seekers, manipulative and agressive angry people who abuse everyone they meet, no wonder they don't want to help us, who would, maybe its better they let us self-harm and be suicidal maybe that is their plan to get rid of us, just a though eh? Fed up reading all the attacks make on bpd yeah ok i am an agressive useless ***** who self-harms and is suicidal just to get attention, i abuse my partner and family and i am so imperfect and do nothing right which is why everyone hates me, now i bet everyone who reads this believes this of me because i have bpd but if i wrote i am a worthy human being who was raped repeatedly as a child and adult, still continuing to this day would that excuse my behaviour would that give me reason to self-harm and be suicidal? No one sees that though do they and no one knows, no one knows all those attempts are attempts to escape this not get ******* ATTENTION, what use will that do me? Anyone not making sense anymore not even to myself, not sure what triggered this maybe reading all the attacks on bpd, hope everyone has a happy and healthy life.
