As I am currently going through a divorce I can't help but think of how my soon to be ex-wife will be going into her second divorce. The circumstances are hauntingly familiar and it made me realize that some people really shouldn't be married to anyone until they take care of their own emotional well-being first. That being said, please take time to read the below marriage vows and if you feel you may fall into the category of someone that needs to take care of yourself first before dragging someone else into your life, don't recite these until that has been done first.
 Male
I _____, take you ______, to be my wedded wife. To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness or in health, to love and to cherish 'till death do us part. And hereto I pledge you my faithfulness.
 Female
I, _____, take you ______, to be my wedded husband. To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, 'till death do us part. And hereto I pledge you my faithfulness.
  These words were put together for a reason and should be taken seriously.
