My friend and boyfriend are both heroin addicts, the friend has been on it for probably a year and he shoots up at least 8 times a day. He was recently diagnosed with Hep C from using dirty needles im assuming. My boyfriend has been on it for about 4 months, he doesnt shoot thought, thank God. They both are the most hard headed people i've met as of now. They used to be the nicest teens, but the heroin took its toll. They argue every single day, and its always about dope. And now matter what i tell them, and how hard i try and talk to them, its just like they don't are. Im terrified, i mean; im only 16 and i feel like im in the middle of this horrible situation. I'll ask my boyfriend to quit for me, and i thought he would but no. And when i cry about it he gets mad at me. I just dont get why they dont understand.. The friend has already been through a detox, he relapsed, so theres no helping him, he's going to die in the next 5 years im guessing because the hep c and the heroin everyday. But my boyfriend has only been using for about 4 months, and i want help. But he will NOT go into rehab, so am I stuck?; Or are there other ways of help? These poor kids are only 17 and 18, and i dont know what im gonna do when i loose both of them to this evil drug. I feel like i could seriously write a novel right now.. But i would just like as much information as possible, thanks for your time.
