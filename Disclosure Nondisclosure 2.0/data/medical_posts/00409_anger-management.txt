My daughter has been acting all moody and angry the past few months. She always hurts her siblings with offensive words and always lets them down. Everytime i talk to her about her being responsible she responds with 'I dont care'and she doesn't take anything seriously and is careless about everything although she does well at school. She is forgettable and not independent at all. I've always talked to her about this but she never listens to me. When we talk sometimes she just blow up and starts shouting at me and acts very stubborn. She always locks herself in her room 24 hours. And as a mother it does hurt me when she mocks at  me and hurts me with her razor-sharp words. And what makes me concerned is when she's very angry she hits herself/pulls her hair/ bangs her head at the door and starts shouting and crying. Then she starts acting mad and starts laughing at nothing. These behaviors makes me very concerned. What is wrong with her? I try very hard to talk to her about this but her response is 'I dont care about others, i care about myself onlyand i do what makes me happy' which sounds a little bit selfish.. Sometimes i think that she might be mentally ill. Should i take her to a psychologist?
