Hi, my name is Kelly and In the past few months i have been extremely stressed out.
I have a lot of things on my mind including huge financial issues, even more huge job-related issues (unsolvable), sexual intimacy issues, just about everything! If i were to write everything down, it looks so simply to fix but when i start writing down ideas and solutions i get too worked up and start crying again. 
 I don't have any appetite (eat maybe 1 meal/day plus a snack...kind of resorting to chocolate bars etc as comfort foods), In the morning i can't wake up and at night i can't sleep. I feel like im going insane!
 I get a tight feeling in my chest a lot (supposedly due to stress?) and the feeling that my head/body can't hold everything in, i litterally feel like i'm going to burst. 
 So, basically, yes i know im stressed and yes i know im depressed. I can't seem to fix it. 
 I know the typical "eat better, exercise, have a schedule and stick to it" plan, but i can't seem to make myself stick to it, or even start it sometimes. even slowly. 
 I need to go to work to get out of my financial debt, but i feel i can't go to work because if someone even looks at me the wrong way i feel like im going to start crying. Doesn't help my boss continually yells at me for ACTUALLY no reason (not being niave). Im a waitress, and while i work, i find myself totally mono-tone. No smiling, etc. I f i do im pretty sure people can tell its fake.
 Any ideas? Can I apply for stress leave? Anything at all would help, i feel like im digging my own hole thats getting very very deep. 
 Thank you, 
-Kelly
