My boyfriend of 1.5 years deals with chronic depression. Things have been especially bad for the past several weeks. When he goes through these bouts he insists he needs to "untangle" things alone. He isolates himself and becomes unresponsive. I have my own mental health issues I struggle with, but we deal with things in very different ways. Sometimes I feel like I'm failing him when I step aside and and let him cope with things, but when I try to step in and offer support or assistance I think he feels like I'm trying to "fix" him, or like he is letting me down or failing me in some way.
 I don't even really know why I'm posting except to look for advice and/or support. I can't turn to him because he is using all of his energy to work through what he is dealing with, I don't feel like I can open up to our friends because I don't want to betray his trust by talking about personal issues that are really his to open up about.
 I feel really isolated and alone with this. I also feel like a really selfish person because I struggle during these instance too... the distance he creates, the lack of affection, and feeling like everything I do and say is wrong and like nothing can reach him is so hard sometimes. It feels so personal even though I know this mental struggle has nothing to do with me.
 For those of you who struggle with/have partners who deal with similar issues or cope in similar ways, what is the best advice you can give me on how to be a good and supportive partner and friend during these times? Is there anything that actually helps?
