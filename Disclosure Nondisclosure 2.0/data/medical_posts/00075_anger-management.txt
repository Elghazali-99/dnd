My husband and I have been married for 4 1/2 yrs.  This is the second marriage for both of us.  I have no biological children, and his children are grown.  About 2 years into the relationship, I noticed that he started showing signs of aggression (breaking cell phones, vacuum cleaners, making verbal threats).  We went to marriage counseling and this has gotten better.  However, now he gets angry if I try to talk to him or ask for help.  I have no one other than him for emotional support.  Last night, I had an unusually stressful week and tried to talk to him about what had happened.  He snapped, "Can't you see I'm watching TV right now???"  He constanly cuts me off in mid sentence and tells me to "stop bitching".  Also, lately when we argue, he says things like, "I hate you", "No wonder no one can stay with you--you probably ran them off", I have other women who want me--I don't have to put up with this", I have never loved you."  He never apologizes when he says these things.  The next day he will say, "Well are you going to keep it going and ***** all day today?"  I love him, but I am at my wit's end.  I don't know how much more emotional abuse, yelling and anger I can take.  I am not in a financial position to leave.  I have health problems and work about 32 hrs wkly, plus I attend college fulltime online courses.  I have no insurance if he leaves me, and I can't financially make enough money to pay all the bills.  He tells me frequently, "You don't want to work--there's nothing wrong with you--it's all in your head" and "I make the money around here."  I am under the care of a rheumatologist for fibromyalgia, and this stress is compromising my health.  I need some advice.  I don't think I can take much more without having a mental breakdown.
