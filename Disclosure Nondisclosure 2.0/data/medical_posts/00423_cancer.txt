PLEASE SOMEONE HELP!! 
 I am an 18 years of age and for at least 2 years now I have been seeing my doctor about severe lower abdominal pain and pain in and around my kidneys. My health has slowly decline and I am putting on weight for reasons beyond me. In the last 6 months my weight has risen from 9 stone to 13 stone with no physical change in my appearance. I constantly have trouble sleeping, shifting my own body weight and walking for long periods of time. I have been on the contraceptive Depo injection for 4 years. As a result of that I have no monthly period. This is seriously affecting my lifestyle, my self confidence and mental stress. 
 I have been recently told by my GP that I may possibly have endometriosis, this was then more recently dismissed by a specialist as possible IBS. Since taking the medication I have been getting worse. I have had various ultra-sounds, to diagnose ovarian cysts but these tests were inconclusive, I have had only one set of gynaecological swabs mainly for cancer this only one test was also negative. 
 As a result of this no other GP in my region will refer me for another test as as far as diagnosis's are concerned this leaves nothing left but possible tumours or cancer.
 Am I correct I thinking a CT or MRI should be performed..
 PLEASE HELP..
