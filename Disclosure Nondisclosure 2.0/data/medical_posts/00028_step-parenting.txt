I have a 4yr old daughter with my boyfriend who has a 14yr old son. We have been together for over 5yrs we are happy and of course have our issues and work through most of them one we can't seem to work through is his sons attitude there is a clear pattern of of his son acting out, and my boyfriend saying he can't do anything because of his mother. I end up getting fed up and try  "forcing" it and that leads to me feeling hated and belittled by both of them. When the son is behaving and doing what is expected things are great, i know his triggers and try by all means to avoid them, lately when i correct him, because of his swearing,he drops the F bomb, he claims he an adult and can do what he wants. That i can't take his tv or xbox away bc its his. So within the last week he had a friend stay against my wishes, ( i caved ) i know he acts out tries to show off but it ends in his dad getting frustrated and then our daughter not listening, i went to bed and for an hour herd him and his friend wrestling around or doing whatever they were doing, and got up and gave them hell, he said they weren't doing anything... but they calmed right down... i awoke the next morning to him screaming shoot that F*ucker (xbox) and then proceeded to say it over and over again, if i dont hear it i dont care. I corrected or attempted again and got a lie, told him one more time and the xbox is off...couple hours later the xbox was off and his dad was calling him. They argued for a good 10-15 mins. We all made plans but because the son "shut down" i was left to them by myself and came home to find the son is never going to give me a chance bc he assumes his dad and mom are going to get back together... and i had to fish for that... after 5 years of being together i would think i have every right to be in the family discussion after father and son talk but no... regardless of that i say take stuff away if he's not going to listen to me or his father...
