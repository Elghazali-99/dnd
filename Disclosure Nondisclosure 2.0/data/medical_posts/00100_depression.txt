Hi. I'm 20 and I have a little sister who's 10 who is going through the same thing as I am. My mom has anger problems and she started beating me since I was 2. She even tried to drown me. However, that's not my big problem. I am extremely smart and when I was 8, my IQ was 128. I was mature as a child, and rather tall and heavy. I weighed about 170 pounds as a kid. My doctor said because I was tall, there wasn't anything wrong with me.
 Ok, to the actual problem :/
I am very, very, very shy. People used to think I was mute. I hated people (and I still do for no reason), I was sad all the time, and I hated myself. What was really weird is that I seem to have different personalities. One moment I may appear happy, another moment I may appear angry or sad. Sometimes I'm very smart, sometimes I'm kinda dumb. I am never willing to talk to anyone. Ever. The only time I may like someone is if the person is through a computer screen. It's sad. When I like an idol (celebrity) through the internet, It's not just fondness. It's an obsession. I get attached to celebrities really bad. I start crying whenever the celebrity doesn't do something I like.
 note: Don't forget my 10 year old sister is going through the same thing. And I can't go get an actual doctor's help in real life because I'm poor, and my family will shun me if they find out I'm getting help. 
 So, do I have multiple personality disorder or what? Is there something very wrong with me? Is there some sort of online help I could get?
