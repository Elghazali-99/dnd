I have a ten yr old step daughter that lives with us 4 day's a week. She is a only child and get's treated like a 2yr old. Her father does not disipline her at all and anything i say goes unheard.My problem is I need to know if me and several other people are crazy, The ten yr old when she is with us lay's all over her dad, will not play with other kid's and was even sleeping with him until i put a stop to it. He was also letting her come in the bath room with him saying she was to young to know anything. She will also do evrything in her power to keep me and him from sleeping in the same bed when she's therer
. He say's she is his best friend and i thought your wife was your best friend. Anyway people have started to question me about her actions with her father. Dont get me wrong i do not think he is abusing her, but there is a unhealthy relationship between her and him.He does not not see it, he is a only child also and does not understand that there is lines not to be crossed when they reach a certain age. I just need help here trying to explain to him what she is too old for and such. She is also like this with her grandfather and step dad. I'm worried about her because she does not act like a ten yr old child. and i need to know how to handle this or my marriage is going to be over. Any advice is welcomed.
