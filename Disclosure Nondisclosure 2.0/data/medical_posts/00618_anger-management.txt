My husband has serious anger control issues that I'm sure he learned from his parents.  His father was in and out of anger managment counselling throughout my husbands childhood and his mother is a perpetually dissatisfied person.  
We have been together for 5 years and in the last few years I have felt like I am tied to a lead block that has been dropped in the ocean.  He is dragging me down and I am watching myself drown.
Our relationship works on a cycle:  He is moody and combative for weeks and weeks while I walk on eggshells in hopes of not setting him off, then he blows up at me (no physical violence though) and then I crack and blow up at him and then he realizes how far he's pushed me, he feels guilty and worships me just long enough (usually 3-ish days) for me to think he's really changed and then he slowly goes back to square one.
I have literally lost count of all the times he's promised me he's going to go to anger counselling and he never does.  He has also admitted to me that he sometimes pushes me to a breaking point to "get a reaction."  
I know that anger issues can be one of the hardest internal struggles a person has to go through.  For that reason, I feel like an ******* if I leave him; what kind of partner abandons their spouse when their spouse needs support?!  
Has anyone experienced a spouse that has actively gotten past his/her anger issues and become a better partner?  I don't know the stats on this and I'd appreciate some feedback.
Am I fighting (or, rather, supporting) a lost cause or is there potential for him to come around?
