Hi, I am 45 almost 46. 
I have had normal (every 25 days) periods lasting 4-5 days for years now. Back in February of this year I missed a period and then they went back to normal again. I was getting my period every three weeks for a few months . Then on Nov, 21st I got it again. It started light and stayed light for three days which seemed odd to me, then it got heavy and then went away. Two days later I noticed brown discharge but not alot. I got this brown discharge for a week but only once a day/, Then I got blood again for another four days. I went to doc, and they did an endometrial biopsy, blood work, and pelvic and transvaginal ultra-sound. All normal. But he said if the abnormal bleeding continues he may have to do a d&c,. The period finally ended. And no blood for 13 days. then I noticed a little blood and brown discharge again. then  nothing. no period, no discharge. It is now January 7th and I have started my period last night./ Very light so far.
 Honestly I am freaking out because I am so used to getting my period every three and a half weeks. I also have anxiety disorder and I worry obsessively about my health. I read on a few websites that a d&c is also a biopsy and that it is more accurate then an endometrium biopsy. SO now im nervous again , worrying that this bleeding is abnormal, I know that periods become abnormal during perimenapause, but noone ever told me that we had to go through so many scary tests during perimenopause. I guess what i really want to know is has anyone ever experienced such abnormal bleeding? and is it uncommon to get the small amount of blood and discharge and then nothing?  how accurate is the endo biopsy anyway? And lastly, I get nervous about being put to sleep, although this may sound pre mature do you have to be put to sleep for a d&c? how common are d&cs and hysterectomies in peri menopause.?
thanks and any input would be greatly appreciated .
