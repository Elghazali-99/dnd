for the last 6 months or more every time me and my husband get into a argument he will tell me that we are getting a divorce. last night i was driving home from work and he was in the passenger side of the car. and like usual he started to complain that i couldn't drive we live 5 min from work i have a valid driver licence and in 20 years have been in one accident where someone rearended me. so we park at home and then he looks at me and calls me a idiot. we go in the house and he starts yelling that i was making his blood pressure go up and i was stealing our money and not paying bill (not true) he then says we are getting a divorce, so by this time i was angry to and said fine by the first of  the year he can start saving his money and get out (the house was mine before marriage) after i cooled of i went to him and told him that i love him and didn't want a divorce. he said no i said it so i'm getting it. what should i do he has a short fuse and he will get mad at anything. i get called stupid, retard, idiot, worthless we have been married 4 years when we first got married he would get drunk and break furniture, he ripped up most of my pictures of my parents. but he hasn't done that in over a year now it it the name calling and he has 2 kids by a prev relationship and he some times does this in front of them. the names happen about 1 a week i do love him am i stupid???
