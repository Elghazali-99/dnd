Hello, 
 This is my first post ever online regarding my mental health...
 My depresion battle is forever ongoing and im trying to deal with it...but my main problem is that my mind constantly runs off random tangents, its like one minute im alright and there is no problems and then something just comes to mind and it puts me at the lowest of lows and can make me feel the worst and then when a problem is in my head i replay the situation over and over in my head in various different ways and i cant stop it even when i try to, my mind just keeps playing the sitatuions over and over....then ten minutes later it goes away, because another thing has popped into my head, not necessarily a bad one, i can have a high for 10 minutes when im with my girlfriend or any other random situation in my daily occurances, however thats when another problem starts...I cant stop reffering to myself in the third person in situations, I imagen my self booking my counciler and having visits during the middle of the day and then it keeps repeating in my head and i cant stop it...some days everytime i think about something it keeps replaying asif im talking to myself in third person again...its like a mental block in real life that stops me from stopping my self, i constantly zone out and the anxiety kicks in and the bad thought come back and i cant stop them...they just keep repeating...through out most of the day i sleep because i cant sleep all night because my brain is just on over time, evem though my body feels tired i still cant sleep, which causes me to sleep all day....theres alot more to talk about but i just wanted to see if anyone has any advice or if im just wasting my time as per usual...
 thanks anyways
