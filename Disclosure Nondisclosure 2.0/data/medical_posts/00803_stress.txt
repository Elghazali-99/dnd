ive been trying 4times now.. 
but all i got is a menstruation.. 
to be honest its really killing me inside.. 
i dont know whats wrong anymore.. 
month of june i was 2weeks delayed.. 
month of july my period didnt come so i got high hopes.. 
then just yesterday i bled.. 
i almost gave up.. 
i dont want to rely on any applications anymore regarding how to know when u are fertile.. 
i dont know my cycle anymore.. 
i also thought of taking a birth control pills and suddenly stop drinking maybe that would help but i remember my 2 cousins took that before the one was drinking and stop and drinjk and stop and drink and stop but never get pregnant and the other one was almost a year since she stop before she gets her 2nd baby.. 
we always make love monthly.. 
to the days when i thought im fertile.. 
to be honest i also have another bf.. 
yeah im having sex with my 2 bf's.. 
isnt is so depressing to know that u cant bear a baby still? 
i just want to cry.. 
i want to forget.. 
as a woman this pregnansy thing is very important.. 
i dont know whos got the problem anymore.. 
judge me if u want i dont care.. 
im just sharing my heart aches.. 
because i want to hurt myself already like i want to do something stupid WHY??? cant i have this? 
my life is very complicated i cant go to doctor ok... 
just some private matters... 
thanx for all who read this..
