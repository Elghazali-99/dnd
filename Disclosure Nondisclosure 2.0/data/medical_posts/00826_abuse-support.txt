I believe my9 year old  grandson is being emotionally bused by his stepmother. The child poops his pants on a regular basis, wet the bed(wears pull ups) is overly compliant when the stepmother is around. This childs mother died 4 years ago when he was 5. His father  my son remarried 3 years ago, they have 2 other children 2years and 2 months. I usually have him about every other weekend, he tells me horror stories about the things she says to him. I know for a fact that she belittles him for soiling his underwear.He tries to hide the soiled pullup from her. His room smells like a barn full of pigs, I went to get his clothes before I picked him up at school Friday  I about passed out when I walked in his room , the stepmother said can you believe he can not smell this. I all but blew a fuse at her, telling her he is 9 years old he is not suppose to be raising himself. Since they have been married he has been responsible for washing his own clothes, totally taking care of himself. His room is usually picked up  but it smells horrible. I feel like telling my son if CPS came to his house and smelled the smell they would probably take all 3 children.
How can I explain to my son that this 9 year old is being emotionally abused by her and more than likely it is the reason he still poops in his pants.
