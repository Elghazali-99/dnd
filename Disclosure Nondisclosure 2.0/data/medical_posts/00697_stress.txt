I am feeling so stressed due to what has happened the last 3 years.  I will try to sum this up ad hope someone can give me some words of encouragement.  About 3 years ago I was stuck with a needle artwork and subsequently acquired Hep C and HIV.  Then just about 2 months after being diagnosed I developed viral encephalitis, and a very bad case of shingles.
 I was unable to walk due to the nerve damage to my spine from some virus attacking my spine.  I have done well on the HIV meeds with minimal side affect.  Have to wait for a new drug to come out for a treatment for the Hep C.  I had minimal use of my leg and worked very hard at physical therapy to the point I am now able to walk short distance with just a cane.
 I had to stop work and due to memory problems and my inconsistent ability to remember things i will most likely not return to work.
 My current issue is I know the Bible says to give thanks in all circumstances.  I try very hard to do so.  When in the hospital I had 5 days of no memory of what happened.  That is really hard for me to accept.  I know of support groups but my husband does not want me to attend.  He feels I should have enough support between him and my family that i should not have to go to a HIV support group.
 I do not feel really depressed although it has taken very little for me to start crying.  I resent having to take meeds al the time and I hate the fear of not knowing if the meeds will work forever.  
 I am very lucky to have a husband and family that doews care and tries to give me all the support I need.  
 Please if there is anyone out there that can relate to the drag of taking meds, living with a potentially deadly decease,
 and the difficulty of dealing with memory loss, physical limitations and just plain miserable I would appreciate hearing from ou.  Anyone believing in praise [lease say them.
