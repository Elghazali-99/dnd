I'm a twenty year old girl who has been battling depression since I was eight. As a child I was emotionally abused and at times physically abused by my father's ex-girlfriend. It's been 5 years since they broke up and I still feel the backlash from my time with her. My parents are divorced and have never had a very good relationship so I grew up in different households over the years but after the incident I started staying with my mother rather than my father. I have began to become very distant and locked away even though I used to be a very up-beat person. I had started cutting last year and have almost overdosed on multiple occasions. I go to a therapist every Friday but she just seems to make it worse. I've been confronted by friends and family who think they can help but I'm not able to accept their help. I'm to afraid to open up about my feelings to anyone I know and I am scared I might not be able to stop myself from doing something I might regret. I need help but don't know who to turn to in this situation. I have social anxiety now and hate leaving the house or even my room because of my unstable emotional state. I've started cutting myself away from the outside world and am refusing the help of doctors and my own parents. I hope one of you can help me before it's too late.
