I've been divorced for quiet long time now. Divorced caused by affairs on his part. I Will say it was the best decision taken for me as a woman. He and the woman moved in asap.They married Soon as divorce was finalized. Everything by my part was accepted. Not to long ago On Feb 14th I took out my kids for a Valentine Dinner. My 15 n 10 yr old daughters asked bout the kinds of gifts their father used to give Me when married to him. I honestly saw no point to the questions non the less i answered them. Heres my issue with that conversation. My girls went on telling me how the last time they'd been at their fathers house the lady (his wife) was recalling old times when they were having the affair how she used to be our neighbor. How everytime their dad wanted to see her he'd just walk across the street to her house. My girls said both the lady and their dad laughed bout it. Truth be told it did bother me ALOT..I just ask myself how could They be like that..it happened long time ago and to still be talking bout it as if they proud of their actions in front of my kids..I can not believe how DUMB i was..How they can be so heartless with My kids. Both my girls long for a relationship with their dad..by him allowing that behavior isnt helping them any. It hurts me cause they my kids..Thank God im out of that marriage. Ive been wanting to talk to him in regards bout it..should i?
