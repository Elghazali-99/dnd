Hi. I'm 18 and was 13 first time I got depressed. I started treating and was taking Lexapro, and was doing ok. Then, when my doctor decidem to take off my med, everything came back, but a bilion times worse. It all started with nausea and headaches that kept getting stronger, I had to go to hospital because of them. I also got depressed again. I have been trying a lot of medicines and therapies. Right now I'm taking Pristiq, Lyrica and Seroquel XRO. By a month ago, I started think in a really weird way, I can't even explain right. It's like every thought brings me sensations, memories, images, etc. and I keep overanalyzing every of them. Also, I'm pretty freaked out about veins and can't stop thinking about them, it's driving me crazy. I also think too much about existential stuff, and that lead me to find life meaningless, I can't understand why we exist, why we use languages, why things are the way they are, etc. I think I am really close of going insane. I think that even if I get cured, if I just remember my thoughts it will all start all over again. I think I'll never be abe to get these stuff solves, as I can't even explain it properly, and want to kill myself. I used to be religious, but I find now impossible to believing anything. I am confused about everything and nothing in this world makes sense to me. I feel also that I can't love anymore. My parents are really stressed and I feel so guilty, I think about going to a psychiatric hospital to leave them alone. I can't figure out what I want, what I know and what I think. I can't make choices. I'm really lost! I feel anger with no reason, and am afraid of being an evil person. I am also afraid that everyone may be lying.
