i have a long distance relationship with my girlfriend, we've connected emotionally like nothing i've ever known, a few months ago she revealed to me that she's been sexually abused by her father and despite her best control and refusals time and again he manipulates her back into that position again, i don't consider it cheating because of the circumstances and i do everything i can to support her through it and get her out of it but she won't get help or let me go to the authorities on her behalf because she's afraid of the damage it would do to her family, i suspect her mother is already suspicious of whats happened but has no proof, she was asked once by her mum about it and she denied whats happened out of habit, i'm the first and only person she's ever told and i'm doing everything i can to support her but i'm having difficulty coping, if it was just helping her deal with her past it wouldn't be so bad but with the fact it's an on going thing that she can't get him to stop and she thinks won't stop until she leaves home it's difficult. also is the fact i want to get along with her family because they dislike and mistrust me but my anger and hatred towards her father makes it all the more difficult, how do i help break her of this vicious cycle without destroying her family and how do i keep my mind whilst doing it, i love her more than anything but every day coping with the distance and this makes it harder and harder
