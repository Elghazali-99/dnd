I feel so down at minute and it seems to be getting worse each day. I was doing okish intil Tuesday then everything went down hill. I was starting to get really panicky so I decided to go for a walk just listening to music as it normal helps enough. But it didn't that night. I don't remember anything still so quite scared as I haven't gone like that in ages but my friends told me all that happened so here I go- i must of walked and not stopped for ages to the middle of nowhere, then I started texting them and they said what I was texting them was quite worrying and they got scared as incase I did something stupid. They both came looking for me and found me, I had cut my arms up pretty bad and staring into space, crying and shaking, still the blade in my hand. When they found me they said that I didn't speak to them once or even looked at them that night. It was really cold that night and I was frozen. They took me back to his to try getting me to drink and eat something but I couldn't, his mum came down to try talking to me but they said she touched me (I hate people touching me) and I freaked out and tryed legging it but they stopped me and wouldn't let me go. I ended up in his room, sitting on the floor, staring into space, crying and shaking still. They couldn't get one word into me, they where so scared as they had never seem me like it. They had to call my mum up as I was so bad, my mum couldn't get a word into me either. 
And that night she found out about my cutting which I have kept hiden for 6years. I'm so stressed out and scared. i don't know what to do? I'm so scared it will happen again.
