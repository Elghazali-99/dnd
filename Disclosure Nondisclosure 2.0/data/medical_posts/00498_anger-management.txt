My son is four years old and very smart. Up until about 8 months ago he was lovable and really into doing things with other kids and me. His biological dad left when he was 3 months old so it has been just me and him up until he was two and i meant my boyfriend who has been his father since. His real dad has a bad temper and i am wondering if he have gotten it from him. I have noticed a difference in my child. He doesnt seem to want to do things with other kids and is mean to them. If they make him mad he will hit them. When he wants something he doesnt ask for it he growls and yells at me like I knew he wanted it. He never asks for anything he tells me what to do. And when I tell him i am not giving it to him until he asks for it he growls at me. I thought this was a phase but its been like 6 months he has been doing it. When he gets mad he throws things and comes up to me and grabs my arm and tries clawing it. It makes me want to cry because he isnt the same lovable kid that would come sit on my lap and watch a movie or to cuddle. He throws anything in site. He has alot of anger towards my brother who has cp. 
I have no idea why but he always feels the need to yell at my brother and act like he is going to hit him. We cant even take him many places anymore. He is mean to people who try to be nice to him. When they ask him his name is replies with a growl. He even growls at the doctors. I need help. please help me.
