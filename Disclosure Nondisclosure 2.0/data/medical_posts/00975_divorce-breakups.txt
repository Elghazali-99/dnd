Hi, I'm 26 and I have two beautiful girls (2 1/2 and 7 months old). I've been with their father for 8 years until recently when I finally got the courage to leave him. It was a very emotionally and twice physically abusive relationship. I was totally brainwashed into believing I deserved this awful relationship when literally one day it clicked that I was better then this and told him it was over. I was called every bad name in the book, could never do anything right and he threatened to kill me many times. I don't know why I stayed but I feel so much better that I'm out. My concern is my children I have always been the main provider and I only take care of them since birth. I have always lived by myself with the kids. He never made an effort to try and live with us or be a family (hello red rag there but I was too blinded to see). 
We live in the same town literally blocks away so he still comes to see the kids 1 time a day for like 1/2 hr and I don't want to keep him away from the kids because I know he does love them. My concern is that he like a ticking time bomb. He ok with this arrangement now but I know one day he can flip and just to spite me take me to court and maybe try and take the kids. This scares me so much because my kids are my everything. I don't want money from him I just want my kids with me becasue honestly it's in their best interest to be with me. The courts scare me and I don't trust them. 
God forbid he did this could I get sole custody in NJ? Let me give you some info
He's been in and out of jail and in 2006 he did 3 years (which I waited for him)
He's not working on the books
He sleeps on his sisters couch
He threantened to kill my father and my father filed a police complaint.
