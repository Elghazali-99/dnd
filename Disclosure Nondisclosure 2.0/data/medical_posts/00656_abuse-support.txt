My little cousin is 7 years old. His dad is veryyyy strict and very abusive towards him, his 12 year old sister and his wife. He's both mentally and physically abusive. I'm going to the main topic so, this 7 years old kid, I caught him watching porn several times, and the history on his tablet is just full of inappropriate videos and images. He makes inappropriate moves with his sis or any other female when no one is around. His sister went to me and cried because he was asking her to remove her top. He always get off his pants and just makes a very disgusting moves, he asked my sister when she will be getting her top off, he always opens the door on his sister whenever she's showring or changing her clothes. His dad once caught him watching inappropriate videos but as I said, he's really abusive, he wouldn't let him go to school for 2 weeks, locked his room, gives him his food to his room and won't let him out only if he wants to use the bathroom. But then after a while, he started with this weird behavior again. I don't want to tell his dad because good things wont happen to this little kid, I mean he hits him with a huge stick when he makes something wrong, and he makes so much things that are scary. I told his mom, she told him and explained to him that this is inappropriate for his age and are bad forr him. But he still wwon't listen. I don't know what to do, and I'm shocked that how would a 7 year old kid knows about porn and things kids shouldn't know about, I guess kid aren't innocent anymore these days. Any advice?
