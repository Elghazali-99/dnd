My husbands father has been diagnosed with bladder cancer that has spread to his lungs. The cancer however, is not the problem. His temp keeps raising and he also keeps passing out when standing up. Today everything got worse! He passed out twice in a row (this has never happened before) and the second time he was actually sat down! His bp is dropping, but we don't know what's making it go lower! Before the cancer he was on high bp meds! He started his chemo last week. Do you think this old have effected him? He's been taken into hospital because of today's episode, but the the most frightening thing is since the second passing out his memory has gone strange. It's like he's not with it...like he's suddenly developed some memory disorder. He didn't know what year it was and he didn't recognise his wife or my husband! Has anyone ever heard of anything lie this? Any thoughts are much appreciated. 
Ps. When he passes out its more like a little seizure...irrational breathing, eyes open, open mouth with stiffened tongue, shaking in arms etc.
