Hi, im a 21 yr old single mother to a 2 yr old little boy named Shaun.  His father has had nothing to do with him and hasnt even seen him.  He wanted me to abort him, and i chose not to!  So im now engaged to the love of my life however he is in the military and in california right now. So needless to say im still a single mommy.  I love every minute of it but there are times I worry im not doing as good as i could be.  Im trying to potty train him now and he is doing ok,  but not as good as i would like, does anyone have any good tips??  but when it comes to dinner time and he doesnt want to eat I dont force him..is this bad??  He has a horrible appetite he hates eating there are times i try to force him but it never works and i get so frustrated.  he weighs 36 lbs and just turned 2 so i dont think he is under weight!  any advise on that?  Now as for his sleeping situation, He will not sleep in his bed, he wants to sleep in his play pen next to my bed, and if i dont let him he is up just about all night crying so i caved and let him and he sleeps ALL night.  I just need some advise good or bad!!  
Thanks!!
