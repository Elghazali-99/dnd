Hi, 28 year old male, consider myself to be pretty healthy. I dont exercise as much as i should be, i suffed a hawkins type 3 fracture of the talus last may, and have been in recovery since. I still have quite a bit of joint and range of motion issues and some persistant joint pain. Lately i have been experiencing alot of fatigue, and when i say lately, its been a few months, and feeling tired alot. Im trying to eliminate some possible causes such as chronic pain, allergies, or something else like thyroid. I cut down alot of caffeine and pop, to almost none, i am trying to maintain a reagular sleeping pattern, i eat pretty healthy, i am always watching that i eat. but i just seem to be tired all the time. Feeling tired all the time, yawning alot at work, i just cant seem to raise my energy level and boost my immune system, i am constantly getting little colds and bugs, which makes it hard to take a sick days because you feel rotten and dont want to be at work, but at the same time, you dont feel sick enough to stay home. Im wondering if theres a link between the joint pain, and maybe its affecting my sleep? I could sleep 8 or 12 hours, and still feel tired when i get up. Some days it doesnt seem to bother me, and some days at work, i could fall asleep. I did have a stressful recovery, and finanical stress which is still on going, but the chronic fatigue seems to be really bothering me, and when i dont feel well, that also stresses me out, its a vicious cycle. I am going to see my family doctor tomorrow, i was hoping to get some feedback on maybe some more questions i could ask him or tests that we could rule out, rather than me just telling him " i feel tired all the time " . Im kind of at a loss, because ive been tested before for thyroid and other things, i do have a bit of GERD, but that seems to have settled down in the last while. 
 Any advice? Tips? Suggestions?
