I know of course that it depends on the individual but I wonder if someone could give me an overview of what Borderline Personality Disorder is?? I've always suspected my mother had some kind of mental health issue but she has never acknowledged there's a problem so will never get a diagnosis. I don't 'need' her to be diagnosed but certainly feel like some information would be helpful in accepting/understanding some of her behaviour over the years. I am due to begin work with a therapist soon who at our initial meeting suggested my mother suffers with some kind of mental illness which was helpful as although my gut has suspected as much my whole life I have blamed myself for everything just as she had always done (blamef me). As far as possible I need though to get the 'right' diagnosis...my sister has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I wonder if my mother falls into this bracket? Are bipolar/borderline personality disorder similar at all?? Please help!! It feels like pieces of a huge complicated puzzle may be starting to fit together.
