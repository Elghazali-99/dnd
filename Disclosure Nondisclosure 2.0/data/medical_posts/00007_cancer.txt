I have had chronic cough issues now for 3 months, during these coughing spells I have had a hard, painful lump appear under left rib, when in bending position only if im leaning over something, It goes away when I straighten up, it hurts like hell. I went to the doctor the firs time she felt there but said theres nothing, maybe muscle strain... great right? well it went away and came back a couple of days ago.
 Now when I sit there feels like something is there, however I can't feel it, theres a burning pain accompanying it. If i stand it feels ok, the burning is persistant today. Under my left rib in my waist line. Painful to press in the general area, but I cant find the lump. It feels like it is blocking my stomach though,
 I been really sick recently and this appeared after a coughing fit, I assume hernia but I also have constipation problems
 I am being seen for a chest x-ray that was abnormal. Awaiting an appointment for an ultrasound for a lump I found in my breast. It seems everything is shutting down on me. 
 I feel a lot of pain in my upper back around my spine in the muscle. I have just been treated for a chronic sinus infection. 
 Wondering if the lump that only appears when coughing is of concern?
