Hi I'm sorry if this is about drawn out but I am struggling  really badly with my health.  I will bulletin my symptoms to make it eaiser all of these are not all at the same time but I suffer with it all badly.
 •. Tiredness. (So tired I have missed work resulting in losing jobs, and can't wake up to alarms) 
 • bad forgetfulness. (Ie I forgot my friends name took be 20 mins to remember it ) 
• very painful knee joints.  
• ache.  
• I have polo cystic overies, hair growth on my face. To the point I have to shave it everyday 
• I'm reckless with money and bad at remembering to pay bills   (I'm in a right mess) 
• abscesses.  More down below   Very painful and regular 
• suicidal. 
  Over the last few days I've seen a doctor about swollen glads in my groin and a very sore and itchy genitals.  Last night I suffered with really bad uncontrollable shaking. I wasn't cold or hot.  
 I need help I never know what to say to a doctor and I clam up when there and forget it all. I'm desperate now I feel like I am falling apart or going crazy.
