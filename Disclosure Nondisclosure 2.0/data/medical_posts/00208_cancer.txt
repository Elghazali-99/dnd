I have looked on the internet because I have been having some changes to my mouth and throat. The back of my mouth has developed two white patches, one on each side, one larger than the other. I also have what looks like a red circular puffy bump on the side with the larger white patch. The very back part of my throat the deepest part I can see looks like it has small red and white bumps. It also has a brownish yellow coating in places. 
 I went to my schools clinic and she just said I had strep and gave me amoxil to take. She did not do any kind of swab.  I took the medicine but didn't change out my toothbrush like she said.(I don't know if that makes a difference) My throat did not clear up. 
 My research says that hpv is a cause of orphangyeal cancer. I have never been to a gyno or had a Pap smear but I have an upcoming appointment in a month. I also never had the hpv shots and I have been sexually active. I have been worried for the past 4 months that I have something wrong. 
 Do my symptoms sound like cancer?
