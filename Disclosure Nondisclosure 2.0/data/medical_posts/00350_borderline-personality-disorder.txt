I am very happily engaged. BUT, I am obsessed with trying to make every man I meet, falling in love with me. Example, I was on twitter and this guy was complaining about love, so I replied. The very moment I re tweeted him, I got a raging jealousy because he was talking about being in love with another woman. I have never met him before in my life, yet I need him to fall in love with me. Why?? Why do I feel the need to try and make every man I know, fall in love with me? I never cheat on my man, but I love to flirt and manipulate a man. I have been told that I may have a personality disorder that fits these symptoms.
 ALSO:   I am obsessed with trying to get pregnant. I am 18 years old and this all started about 2 years ago when I met my husband to be. I started to get extremely depressed when I would see other teens or women pregnant, and when I started having unprotected sex and I wasn't getting pregnant, I started to worry and now I cant help but want to be pregnant. I try and try and it just doesn't happen. and I will miss a period and hope that it finally happened, but it never does. Please help me
