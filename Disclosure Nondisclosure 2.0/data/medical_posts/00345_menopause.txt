hi this website is very informative however at times I feel too far gone to regain any ground lost but going to start right now – was on heavy steroid treatment (dextramethazone) for brain surgery occurring at onset of menopause (am 59 now) – gained thirty plus kgs -lost any desire for exercise (or sex) and struggle to have motivation – the cycle is a downward spiral but I feel a glimmer of hope now – I started maca mixed in with coconut yoghurt two weeks ago and now searching for a good supply of progesterone which I understand may help with the weight gain in mid section  – my GP views my weight issue as related to diet only which is no help and confuses my digestives -  the neurosurgeon avoids discussing any possible side effects that I had from the steroid treatment – so a very frustrating few years behind (literally) !  
 Believe it or not I am pleased to read of other similar situations simply so I now know I am not alone – because I live with the part of tumour that was inoperable I try to keep exercise as controlled exertion to avoid possible fatal outcomes (warned by neurologist) although I do walk every day 6-10k upwards plus drink 2-3litres water – gluten free – vegetables raw or steamed mostly  – no dairy and no caffeine off and on – it does make a difference to weight gain so started on dandelion tea, apple cider vinegar, ginger and ginseng recently for brain fog which has helped – I practice the intermittent fasting and lean toward Paleo – would like to consult with a good naturopath however have found my pockets empty and no results in the past so trying to do this myself now – any advice or comments gratefully received !
