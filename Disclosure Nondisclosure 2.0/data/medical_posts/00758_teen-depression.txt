I am a 15 year old girl who has been suffering a lot these last few months. My parents, friends and everyone around me arent getting along these past few months. I have noticed that lately Im only happy when Im away from my family and doing something for me. I fight with my mom, a lot. And I feel like I reah out and no one can help. My best friend has suffered from depression for a couple of months now and I feel like I have the same things wrong. She and one other are the only people I really talk to about my problems. 
-I have lost 5 pounds in 3 weeks
-I have recently been crying a lot for no reason or very little problem.
-I have become very mean
-I have began to cut myself.. I'm not suicidal it just makes me forget about the pain in my heart.
-I have becomke very anit-social.
-I lately do not like being touched.
 Whenever I bring getting help up to my mom, she laughs. She's the reason why I am so angry lately. She treats me like I am 5. I am about to be a junior in high school. I dont drink, do drugs, or have sex. Just small things that she does make me so angry and I end up freaking out and go to my room and cry. 
 I feel so alone.
