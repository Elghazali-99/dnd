My husband and i been together 5yrs married 2yr.  Ever since we got married he has changed into a different person. I like the ideal of him having control and being the man of the house but for the last yr he has became hard to deal with. He cusses me, yells at me, tells me to learn to be his wife, i need to do what im told, and be a better mother. There is no respect for me at all. I try to not argue with him but he constantly pushing my buttons to make me cry. I've got to the point where i dont even know what to say to him,  im afraid I'll say it wrong and he will take it the wrong way. I has gotten so bad one day that i felt i couldn't take it no longer and i hit him to get him to stop. I kept telling him over the past yr to stop. It just seem to get worse. I feel bad that i hit him cause I truly love my husband but now he wants a divorce. And I've said sorry over and over but no response. He said it was over the day i put my hands on him. We haven't saw each other in 3 months. Why can't he see what happened that day was from something that was building up over time. I've said him over and over to stop. Is this my fault, and should this be a reason for divorce?
