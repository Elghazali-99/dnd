I am in Europe. I waited for Valdoxan, hating the side effects of Cymbalta of Effexor which both worked well for me.
 I started taking it last May one month after a bereavement (just a coincidence) that was the first date it was available here.
My first month of the bereavement was normal enough, i reacted the same as my family. 
 I slowly (with hindsight) became more wound up, racing thoughts about the bereavement. I thought that it was the bereavement process. Then i started feeling anxiety, quite strong for a couple of hours each day.  I went for counselling.  No progress. It got to the stage where my Dad wouldnt let me speak to my MOM on the phone because i was too much for her, crying and obsessing over everything.
 IT WAS THE VALDOXAN , my doc even added an antipsychotic because on the Valdoxan i would bolt out of my sleep at 4 am. I stopped this medication and 2 days later all symproms stopped.  The Valdoxan caused this reaction, severe.  But somehow i didnt 'click ' this, because of all the media hype about it.  That it had few if any side effects.
 Not being able to sleep all night
Increased anxiety
Racing thoughts
Obsessive thoughts
 Basically it nearly drove me over the edge
 Be careful please.
