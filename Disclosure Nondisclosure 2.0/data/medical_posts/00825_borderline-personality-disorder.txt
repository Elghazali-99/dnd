I think that my mom has BPD... I have not told her this, and she won't seek help because I am the only allegedly with the problem.  I am going to keep this simple - I am just looking for opinions on how to handle her.  One week my mom loves me and compliments me and is sweet, friendly - the next week she is indifferent to me, gets angry when I disagree with her or don't take her parenting advice - and I mean the type of angry where she doesn't talk and gets mean.  I myself struggle with depression and feel lonely a lot and she seems to exploit this by coaxing me to talk to her when I am feeling down.  I recently talked to her about my marriage and things being stressful and that is when I was reminded of why I don't do that... Anyway she started really pushing me to let her have my kids overnight. 
 I don't want my kids to spend the night at her house.  I don't really like them at her house because I don't want them to be manipulated and treated the way I was as a kid.  I also don't trust her - when I had my 2nd child, she was to stay at our house with my toddler but she didn't and she didn't tell me either.  She pretends that didn't happen and it dismisses it or my anger or feelings about it.  
 Ugh... point!  So, I don't know how to respond.  I don't really want a relationship with my mom to be quite honest.  I am sick of the drama... I've had a lot of it.  I don't mind her babysitting at my house occasionally but beyond that, I don't want her to.  Voicing my concerns and feelings has happened and they are dismissed, forgotten, cursed at... I really am sick of going down that road too.  
 I don't even know specifically what I need advice on, but I want to keep my distance from her, but at the same time her being nice and then mean messes with my head, so during nice weeks I am like "why am I mad at my mom?" and then I remember and go back and forth and back and forth... help!
