Hi all, I am new to this forum. My husband has two kids that we get every other weekend. One is 11 yr old girl and the other is 8 yr old boy. I have been in their lives since before the boy was born and since the girl 4. I feel like they are my own. I talk openly with the little girl and try to keep her feeling like she can always come to me. She comes to me all the time. With questions and letting me know her feelings. So situations are coming up that I have a different opinion from her mother on. Their father typically agrees with me but doesn't want to fight with the mother. 
 So now here comes my question how do you stay on the sidelines and keep from upsetting the bio parent as one poster once said? I don't want to upset the mother or confuse the children but at the same time I feel so strongly about certain things. I love the kids as my own especially since I may never have my own. This makes it hard to just sit on the sidelines and watch my little girl especially be so upset over her womanhood. 
 If anyone has advice I would be grateful. Their are a few long stories of times when I have complete disagreed with the mother. I have tried not to let my heart and emotions rule and have really thought things through, but that is getting hard. Especially since the topics are bigger issues then when they were younger.
