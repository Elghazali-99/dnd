So I turn 19 in november and my baby is due jan 30th. Him and I were only together for 5 months when I found out I was pregnant..ive had a couple 2 year relationships I dont think what I have right now is just a young stupid love its real...and he ended up going to bootcamp soon after we found out. Which is where he is now. We moved fast..we just graduated and moved in together at his parents house for awhile before he left..he feels like "the one" and we were talking about taking a chance and getting married when hes back from boot so I can go somewhere with different school opportunities and be with him. When I found out I was pregnant we decided lets do it before he left. Now im getting bigger and feeling more lonley and scared because hes gone and do I know what im getting myself into? Leaving my family, getting married, ng a baby, and being a marine wife? All so quick! Im working non stop and supper stressed living with my grandparents and being away from him doesnt help. I dont want to be hard on the baby with all this stress. But I love him and my baby..if I stayed circumstances would be worse so im going through with this...its just hard. Idk what answer im looking for...maybe someone can give their advice or have a similar situation?
