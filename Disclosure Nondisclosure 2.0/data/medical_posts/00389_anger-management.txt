I am a work from home mum of 2 kids aged 4 years (girl) n 5 years old (boy). basically i hv them get ready for school at 8am. then do some household chores within the hour. i am.so stressed with work as a graphic designer n organizer that sometimes it takes a complete day to do things. i hv to pick up the kids at 1:30pm...then the frustration starts as they dont let me work. they seek my attention most of the time...n will ask for things to eat n play. they will come near me and bug me. n wont let me talk on the phone with clients. i get really frustratd an start yelling at them. sometimes will b to a extreme. which i hate myself for doing after i hv done so. they sometimes make me cry too. my husband works part time. n he is usually sitting on the computer or watching tv. hv no family which seems not a really healthy family. i get pissed off at him n yell at him for the same. i need to get my life back to track. want to spend time with kids...i get mad at almost everyone without a reason...i need some advise on wat to do....makes me upset not being able to love my kids like i wanted to..
