This post isn't a question. I just wanted to share an experience that might give people some hope with regards to coping with the sexual dysfunction often experienced on the SSRI class of drugs.
My husband takes Zoloft and has had problems reaching orgasm and maintaining an erection during sex practically his whole adult life/he's been on some form of SSRI since age 22. His doc prescribed Buspar,(buspirone) as a possible counter to this side effect.
After about 5 weeks of taking it, my husband's sexual problems have vanished,in fact,he now has a different problem. He's too sensitive, he orgasms too quickly!! We ended up backing his dose off a little bit and now we have hit a happy medium and he says his libido and ability to perform is better than when he was a teenager, he's 38 now. he was using Viagra with some success but didn't like the face flushing and overall "freaky" feeling he would have on it.  We haven't used Viagra in some time now.. 
just thought i'd share this..maybe Buspar can help someone else out there too...it's usually prescribed for anxiety (though most don't think it's too effective for this purpose) and it has almost no side effects..at least my husband has experienced none..
hope this helps someone!!
