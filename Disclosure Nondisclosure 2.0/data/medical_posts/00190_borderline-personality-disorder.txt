hi I am 22 years old and have been diagnosed with BPD for years. My "complete" diagnosis is Major depression, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, SIB, panic/anxiety disorder. I have read alot about BPD though and at the moment i am questioning the diagnosis. I mean i don't consider myself to have unstable relationships. i have friends that i have been friends with for over 10 years and we rarely ever fight. I do have low self esteem and the only thing i can really think that I do on impulse is self injure. I do sometimes fear being alone but at the same time i often want to be alone. i dont go between putting someone on a pedistol and then devaluing them. i'm not exactly sure what unstable self image is but if its what i think then yes. i go between liking myself and not liking myself. i have had several suicide attempts. i can go from being content to suicidal within minutes. i dont display anger. i am often suspicious of others an my lose of reality i guess would be voices and dissociating.  I would like youre opinion because if you agree with the diagnosis then i'm not going to get re evaluated by another doctor but if you disagree then i may.
