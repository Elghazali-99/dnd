I've been treated w various antidepressnts since 2000 they all work awhile then not. I've learned in past year I am severely ADHD adderall is a God send. But I think it messes up my vision(you also?)I assume my current antidepressant Vibryd is no longer as effective after less than a year as creeping in depression is now such that I'm crying and empty feeling despair in morns before adderall. Then a whole new world on adderall. Then anxious and agitated as it wears off.  How did you successfully treat around the adderall ?? What did your doc do ?? I've always been neg for thyroid but suspected for years. My psychiatrist mentioned trying a thyroid med. But haven't got there yet. I've unfort taken klonopin for years - low dose at night. I've partially weaned. Wondered if over time klonopin culprit for depression ? I have lupus. And I think I could also be entering peri menopause. Fun fun. I had my gallbladder out and I do believe the after affects of anesthetic cause for moodiness too. Nonetheless the depression around  the adderall has been there long time now. I think sep from surgery after math. Help! And thanks!!!
