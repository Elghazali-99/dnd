I was very happly married for 30 years and one day my husband just said I not in love with you anymore, I had no idea he was unhappy. I am crushed and I seem to walk around in circles all day thinking why? How could this happen, I think he is sleeping with the 22 year tart two doors down. He is very cold and angry to me know, I wonder what he is thinking, if there are any men out there who have been through this please explain what is going on. My husband lost his dad 1 year ago and I thought he was just sad, I tried to talking to him but nothing.  He drinks a lot now and smokes which he never did. The girl he is hanging around already has a child to some man and she drinks a lot and smokes and she has very little friends because she tends to sleep with friends partners. I dont want this man back but I cant get him out of my head, I am thinking of him constantly and I dream of him. What is wrong with me, I am getting stronger I can feel it and I am keeping myself busy and I have councelling and my doctor gave me sleeping pills.  How long does it take to get him out of my head?  I have no comunication with him at all and he bags me to the kids, I am staying nice about him to the kids but it is hard, I just want him out......
