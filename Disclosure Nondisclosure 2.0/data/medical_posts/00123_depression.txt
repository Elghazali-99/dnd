Hello!  I'm new to this site so don't mind me if I'm not 100% on what I'm doing. A couple years back I had extreme depression, anxiety and I suffer from bi-polar. It was from the age of ten to eighteen, I'm currently nineteen and have been clean from cutting/burning/pill overuse etc for about four months now and off all medication. Two days ago I got the implant as I recently found out that I have polystistic ovaries and was told this is the only thing that will help with my periods and give me a higher chance of being able to have kids but have found that ever since the day I got it in I have been very angry/snappy and very depressed and suicidal, I've heard around that the implant can cause this so I guess I'm just asking whether anyone else have experienced this depression with the implant, what the best thing for me to do would be and also whether I should keep the implant and go back on my meds as my fiancé is finding it hard to handle my depression again as he was around for the first time and it causes him depression also and pretty much just any other advice you'd be willing to give! Thank you all so much for your time, it means a great deal
