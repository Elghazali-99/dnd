For as long as I could remember I knew that I had something, but I would always shrug it off because I thought it was just part of being a teenager. For instance, I think I have a mild form of ADHD. I am 20 years old, a 3rd year university student, and I always find myself doing all my assignments the DAY OF. My marks are pretty good in regards to my study habits, but recently I think it's worsening. I also started taking Alesse, i'm on my second pack now, and the side effects are taking a toll on me. I have always loved sleeping, but now I can only sleep when i'm extremely exhausted, and i prefer to stay in bed for hours. I live with my friends, and i don't even want to see nor converse with them. Everything annoys me, and i feel that it's best to avoid people just so i don't act rude or mean towards them. However, a few days ago i have started to cry sporadically. My mood fluctuates like mad, but i'm rarely happy, i'm just either really upset, annoyed, empty, or sad. I set an appointment with my doctor, but am i just being lazy? Or do i have something.  Now it's harder for my to start any assignment, i just want to stay in my room and go on my laptop- i don't even want to leave to use the bathroom. When i start to cry or when i start to feel sad and overwhelmed, i feel really cold. I don't feel ambitious, and i'm started to get scared. I think the birth control pills are heightening my worries and emotions. I don't know what to do. Am i just being lazy? I feel reluctant to do any task.
