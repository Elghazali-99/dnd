Hello, 
I am unsure if I am pregnant or not. I had sex for the first time on July 28 after my predicted ovulation date (July 26) I have been tracking my period and know my cycles are between 27-30 days long. We did not have any kind of contact without using a condom and the condom did not break or slip at all, I am currently not on the pill. Afterwards we did not touch each other until we had cleaned ourselves up and put underwear on. I was expecting my period around August 9 and was having my usual pre period symptoms, cramping white discharge, acne breakouts but my period never came. I've taken 3 pregnancy tests so far one the day before my period, the day after and the last day of my expected period (today). I used two types clearblue and first response early detection- all three were negative and I plan to take another this Friday. I keep feeling like my period will start and cramping but then it goes away. I'm not sure if I am overthinking or freaking myself out or like my boyfriend keeps saying that because it was my first time having sex my body is adjusting. I know stress can delay my period and I do have a doctors appointment in a few weeks, I just would like to ask women out there as I do not have any close female friends and my mom passed away when I was young. Thank you.
