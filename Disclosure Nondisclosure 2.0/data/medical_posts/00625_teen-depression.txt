Hi ppl!!Something very tragic and unexpected happened recently.My father passed away in a car accident and i cant make peace with the fact that im never see him again.i keep thinking about the day his colleagues came to tell me that he was no longer with us,for a moment there it felt unreal,but when i got home from potch,it then hit me that he's really gone.i've always been daddy's girl and its upheaval for me to let go of him and make peace with his death.he passed away on july 28th at about 12 noon.he was driving from bloemfontein to home along with two other colleagues.they all died due to a head-on collision with a truck and they were all injured very badly.im really trying to be strong but the truth is,im not succeeding.im even failing at varsity and i dont understand why because i do study.i really miss papa,sometimes id dial his number hoping to hear his voice,but then it hits me that his gone.i spend most of my time thinking about papa.I am sad,hurt and angry right now-angry at the world,angry at those who still have their fathers and angry at life!!!life can get ****** and unfair!!!ive gone to doctors and they've prescribed all kinds of anti-depression pills and they're not helping much.my school work is suffering and i feel helpless because i do study but nothing productive comes out of it.i dont want to give up on life and i certainly know that papa would want me to be successful and happy in life,but right now life ***** like hell!!!how do i deal with my pain??
