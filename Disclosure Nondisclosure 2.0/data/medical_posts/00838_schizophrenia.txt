I’m after some advice about potential hallucinations…I have OCD, and GAD, and im convinced I suffer from either BP or Schizophrenia, but my PDoc disagrees, especially with the Schizophrenia.
 I’m always checking if I see things out of the corner of my eye, or hear thing, or smell things, im always asking my friends to confirm if I have seen/heard things etc, this seems to come in waves, I keep making out faces in carpets rugs etc also – nothing gruesome, it just startles me though fuelling my anxiety. I know this is related to my Schizo hallucination fear. However recently the following has happened to me:
 I keep getting a strange chemical ‘whiff’ on my left hand at work, it smells like a paraffin type waxy smell (I work in the Jobcentre) this has happened maybe 6 or 7 times over the past 6 months – I think when this happens I am normally quite stressed at the time (Lack of sleep – although I normally am 24/7) I think the stress is first before this? Or maybe it comes after im not sure.
 I can not pin point where the smell is coming from, and it only occurs on my left hand, it does seem to spread to my pocket or clothing if I rub it on my hand (If that makes sense?!) I have retraced my steps just after the smell appears, and can not  for the life of me identify where it is coming from…I look crazy sat at my desk sniffing my coat etc to try and find out. It sends me into a panic, sets my anxiety off, and makes me feel awful.
 I’m convinced it could be a hallucination, and a sign of Schiz or BP? It only happens in work…
 The smell gradually disappears throughout the day…and leaves me feeling confused after…now I just don’t know if its real or not, and there’s no way for me to find out? Does this sound like a hallucination as such? I know im asking for reassurance…but I don’t know what to do…its driving me crazy, does this sound like a typical hallucination, or am I worrying too much?
