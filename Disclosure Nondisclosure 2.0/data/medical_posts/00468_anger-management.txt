I think my anxiety/depression problem stems around my relationship with my boyfriend.  I am starting to think he is bi-polar.  He verbally abuses me on a regular basis.  He makes me feel so low, I cry for a couple days after a fight. He is successful, intelligent, eccentric and makes a lot of money.  He has called me a idiot, loser, crazy and that I have to "earn his respect" whenever I try and defend myself he gets in this rage and the insults start.  Here is a example of a argument.... we recently got a new Mainecoon kitten, I was trying to get him to look at him play, my boyfriend roles his eyes says he is "too busy" because he is getting ready for Burning Man may I add  "at the last minute", then I get upset and confront him about it, then he goes into this rampant rage. He grabs my arm so hard it made a bruise and then he knocks his knuckles on my head.  He blames me for everything, if something goes wrong its my fault. May I add I have never insulted him once. Later when he calms down he seems to regret what he did and he starts being very nice.  He is also very hyper sexual, I am started to think he is just using me as a object. He also wants to be high on some kind of drug all the time.
    I am just so confused, I hate living at home with my parents, I don't meet or connect with people easily, the only kind of people I seem to connect with are ones with mental or emotional problems, its like I would rather be abused by my boyfriend than move back home and be stuck in my room alone.
