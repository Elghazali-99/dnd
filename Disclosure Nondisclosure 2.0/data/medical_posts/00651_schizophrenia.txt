My brother is 21 years old, and he has been displaying symptoms of *schizophrenia. Within a 3 weeks, we have been noticing significant changes in my brother's mood, higher agression, laughing and talking to himself, violence, extremely moody. Roughly 6-10 months ago we have noticed signs of depression since he lost his job, and girlfriend, so he has just been at home on the computer every single. day.
 This past week, my brother has made life-threathening threats to my mother and father, calling them evil, and devils, and how my mother killed people in the past. It also seems as if he hallucinates since he goes outside various times late at night and just sits and talks to "someone" (nobody). Currently he is withheld in a county jail for making threats such as almost striking my father with a rock. This dilemma has torn our family. 
 My question is, are these symptoms of schizophrenia? and my brother has no health insurance so will he be liable to be treated, medicated, or able to see a psychiatrist? what can my family and I do?
