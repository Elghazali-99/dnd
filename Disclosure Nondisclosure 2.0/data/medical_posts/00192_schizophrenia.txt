hi, recently i was told my grandma has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenia. she has been having mental disturbances for the past several years and is in her late 70's. i live on the opposite side of the country and am unable to go check out the situation myself. my mother has been keeping me updated is not the most trustworthy person (she has come back from several terminal illnessess over the years and has been wanted for fraud) and i am not sure i can believe all the stories she sends me. supposedly my grandma thinks people are trying to kill or rape her. she spends entire nights screaming. she believes family members come over to steal from her when they havent seen her for years. she thinks i have a second child that lives in a tree in the yard. she ties her hair in knots and then has no idea who did it to her. she refuses medication and the doctors say the only solution is a mental hospital. i am working on having the state go over and evaluate the situation. from my reading it is very rare for a person of her age to develop schizophrenia and would like to hear from peoples personal experiences. thanks you!
