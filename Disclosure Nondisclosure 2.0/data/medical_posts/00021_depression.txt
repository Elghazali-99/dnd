Hi, I am 16 female and I know it's normal to have depression at my age but for the last 3-4 months I have been having other problems. It's hard to fall asleep at all, I end up staying up as late as 4am even on school nights, I'm seeing things that aren't really there mostly when I'm reading. I could be reading "the boy sits on a chair." and read it totally different as "The dog jump on a cat." it happens a lot and I end up questioning what I'm reading if what its saying is true or not. 
 When I do sleep my dreams are sad at first and become nightmares. I eat pretty healthy for a teen and don't do drugs or drink, I'm also not sexually active but I have been having throbbing pains in my bowels and no at those times I don't have to use the bathroom. It's also getting harder to stand up, I'm not over weight and I don't find it hard to walk it's just my body doesn't seem to want to say up right. My heart jumps a lot too making me have to take in more air which only makes me dizzy and every once in a while I get a stabbing pain on the left side of my head. 
 I haven't hit my head since I was a child and there are no cuts or anything I could see to answer why there's pain there. It might just all be in my head but I am getting worried so if anyone can give an answer that would be grate.
