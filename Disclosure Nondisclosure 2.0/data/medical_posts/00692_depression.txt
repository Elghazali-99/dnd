Hello, I've been depressed for a while now and I have already felt depersonalization/derealization before, but it usually only lasts for a day or two at a time or when my anxiety is real bad. Lately for the past week I haven't felt like a real person. I feel very disconnected from myself. I'll get consistent negative thoughts at night that make it difficult for me to sleep too. They're always about things I very much regret from the past and just stupid things I've done in general. It's difficult for me to even look my family in the eyes from the time I wake up. I feel guilty, like they don't like me because of the stupid things I've done in the past that they never approved of and so on. I don't know what to do. It's difficult for me to even choose what to wear or what music to listen to at the time, because I don't feel like myself and don't choose what I normally would. It's making me feel crazy. I'm numb. What's going on?? I feel like just a body between crowds when I go out. I don't even like talking or thinking sometimes because I don't even feel human. It's bothering me so much.
