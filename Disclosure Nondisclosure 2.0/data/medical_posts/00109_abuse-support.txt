My sister went for a playdate with another mum who has a daughter 3 and a half and a boy 8 months. When she got there the mother had cut herself and saying how she abuses the kids and doesn't want to live anymore she's on ice and hates her kids and that the reason her daughters dad is in jail is because she let him rape her. Her son has a different dad who has a heroin addiction. My sister offered to take the girl home with her for the night, my sister also has a 3 year old and 1 year old daughter. She couldn't take the boy because his dad woulda came around a possibly killed my sister for taking him. Tilly, who is the little girl can barely talk , she is on the same academic level as my son who is 18 months. My sister bathed her a d said she was so dirty like she hadn't been washed for days. Her private bits were so inflamed with thrush. So we think her step dad maybe raping her to and she has bruises all over her body. Were so affraid as her son also has bruises on him. We want to call child protection, but were also so scared the father will do something to us.
