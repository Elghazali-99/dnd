My girlfriend is living with me and she has BPD.  She is driving me absolutely out of my mind.  I use to just go along with whatever she said, then I started thinking that I needed to stand up for what I wanted.  So now if I don't want to watch something or do a certain thing I tell her and I don't.  The real reason for my question here is that no matter what tact I use to try to NOT to engage her when I sense a pending argument we ALWAYS end up in a screaming match anyway.  She's 27 and I'm 50.  I've tried just not arguing and I get my manhood attacked.  I've tried softly talking and I get the I'm not a client response and it's on.  I tried telling her I need her to leave me alone when I know a fight is coming.  I've pleaded with her to let me be.  The second I don't agree with her or want what she wants she gets real sarcastic and eventually there's the name calling and attacks on my manhood - "why don't you grow a pair and communicate with me!"  Yesterday was the worst.  The last 3 fights I've said I don't want her around anymore, I can't live like this.  I'm no saint and I know it.  I can't always tell her the truth cuz she won't process it correctly so I lie and I suck at it and get caught.  Yesterday I begged her to leave me alone, she wouldn't and I told her to leave.  She said no I live here and this is my house too.  The mortgage is in my name not hers and she pays none of the bills cuz she can't even take care of the ones she's got.  Anyway it escalated real bad and eventually she started packing her stuff about 2 hours later.  I don't want her to go, but I do.  She knows every one of my buttons and goes right to them.  HELP!!!!!!!!
