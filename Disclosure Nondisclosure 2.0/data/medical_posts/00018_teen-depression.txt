I've been dealing with depression and self harm for about 7 years. I, only 3 years ago when it started getting worse, got help and began meds. I've been on meds ever since trying every drug out there and I finally found one that makes me feel better. I began cutting when I was 12 and it always madero feel better. At first they were only small scrapes. Then I moved to duller objects and started rubbing my skin hard. Making a swap burn/gouge. Then I started actually burning myself. I have not self harmed in 2 weeks. But I'm getting more anxious as time goes by and I'm feeling the need to self harm more and more. I'm feeling so depressed lately I want to take all of my meds. But my medications I'm prescribed are very thought out. The combination of all my meds would make me barely drowsy and most likely nauseous. I've tried to kill myself 4 times. Each time on overdose. I'm thinking of trying something else. Idk what to do. I'm just so stressed out I have a million things running through my mind and I don't know what most of tem are because they're moving to fast. I feel like my head is going to explode!!!! Please help!!!!
