My problem started about five or six years ago. It has gotten worse with time and events that have happened in my life. At first I would only feel extreme mood swings ranging from suicidal thoughts with no action "because I'm too cowardly and selfish to do something like that", to not having a care in the world like everything is perfect. Recently I have been noticing that my problem has gotten much worse. I have been with my boyfriend for two years now, and we recently moved from Florida (where I grew up and lived in a small town for all of my 26 years until about 6 months ago) to Colorado. My boyfriend noticed my problem in Florida, but I tried to hide it so we could go on with our "normal" lives. Since the move, he (and a friend I have who lives here too from Florida) often mentions changes he has noticed in me. One is that I can NOT drive anywhere without having some sort of panic attack or very stressful episode. Another is my mood swings. They are very uncontrollable and I feel so badly when I am in a bad mood with him and also I can't deal with these horrible feelings anymore.I feel so lost and alone, even when I am not at all. I use to be so confident, did beauty pageants, was a cheerleader, on student council, active with friends and family. Now I always feel like I'm not pretty enough, I am useless on this earth and wasting space... I can't even type well right now because typing this fills my eyes with tears. I just want to be me again. I like to think that I am a smart and reasonable person for the most part and can not over come this for some reason. I really don't know what to do, it doesn't go away :( I know I wrote a lot but I really need advice. Am I just having mood swings? Am I bipolar? Please help.
