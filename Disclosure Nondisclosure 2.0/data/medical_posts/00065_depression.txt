This message might seem all over the place cause I don't know where to start. I just turned 24. I'm married and have a step son. I also had a baby girl September 2014. I remember feeling like  I didn't have any help with caring for my daughter. My husband took almost a week to even hold her for more than five minutes. So I guess that's when I started feeling a little overwhelmed. Then in January I lost my mother (my only living parent, the only parent I knew). My job was taking care of her so I lost that when I lost her. Got a new job making a lot less money (only income in the house, husband can't find a job). Got so far behind on bills and received shut off notices. I'm still trying to catch up financially even though it feels impossible. I've been feeling depressed everyday. If I could stay in bed each day, all day long, I would. I cry almost everyday. The night my mom passed runs through my head all the time. I still see her laying on the ground after emt's tried saving her. Her passing is the hardest thing I've ever been through. It seems like everyday of my life is a repeat so it feels useless living this life. I'm so thankful I have my daughter because without her I don't know where I'd be. I know she needs me to grow up. My husband and I have been married for two years but now things are going downhill. We've been separated for the last month but still live together. We argue almost everyday over stupid things. I've told him about feeling depressed but he doesn't seem to care or help me. In March I've called our towns outpatient psychiatric clinic to see about getting help for depression but they never return my calls. I don't know if I should talk to my primary care doctor about feeling depressed. I don't know if there is anything she could do for me. Does anyone have any advice?
