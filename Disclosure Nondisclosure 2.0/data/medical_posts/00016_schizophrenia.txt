ok ive been reading a lot and im kinda scarred . for awhile now ive been day dreaming a lot I will have conversations with people in my head i could imagine im talking to a close friend of mine or someone i don't even know i don't ever hear voices unless im forcing it to happen i will sit in my room put my headphones on listen to music and just sit there and day dream all day long . but im not loosing touch with reality i know the difference between one of my day dreams and reality sometimes i could even get angry in my day dreams and start arguing with someone whos made me mad or something . i read online about this thing called maladaptive day dreaming witch sounds a lot like what i have also i will sometimes go outside and pace around just walk around my yard and everywhere else and do this to but i never really get lost in the process . and i also have a social problem as well i hate bumping into people i know that a haven't seen in  while and i get really scarred around people i don't know sometimes if im walking down the road and i see  group of people walking towards me i will try nd avoid going past them because im afraid they will judge me in some type of way what could this be i should also add that i do have anxiety maybe that will help but i do talk to my grandparents a lot and my sister and brother and i have a best friend who i hang out with as well im not completely cut off from the outside world i also am 23 years old and ive never had a job because im afraid to be around people what do you think this is
