Hi, everyone, well most of you know my story, married 30 years, he had a midlife crisis and left his family for a 22yr old neighbour, it has been 10 months now and our pregnant daughter has asked him and I to talk and become friends for the baby, it is important to her that her child has grandparents who like each other.  I have tried every hard and he fought me all the way, so I said enough NO more thankyou.  My daughter went off at ex hubby and now he is trying to be friends and Jess asked me to give he a second chance, which I have. He is no longer with the young girl and swearing to our daughter that nothing happened between them, I dont believe it at all. He has told the kids he wants to see if he can fall in love with me again. He said he wants me not to date or sleep with anyone while we are trying....However I said to him do you have feelings for me and he said, I have no loving or romantic feelings toward me....Then what gives, I was doing fine without him, and now I know in my head that I do not want this man, but the kids really want it and I am tried of pleasing everyone and not me.... By the way I wasn't asked if I wanted to try....everyone has decided for me....So give me your opinion.
