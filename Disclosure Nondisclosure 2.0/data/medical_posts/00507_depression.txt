Hello
I'm 20 years old...and my girlfriend is 21...she is my first girlfriend, we've been together for nearly 2 months now..first month was absolutly wonderful really best month of my life..thanks to her..about 2 weeks ago maybe abit more..things just..changed for us..she started to seem cold and she barely spoke to me(all this was on facebook) we sorta have a long distance relationship..so far she's been over at my place twice(each time for nearly a week)..also i should mention she works alot she's a photographer and I'm still in high school and none of us has a driving license..I got paranoid ofcourse I tried my best to hide it but I just couldn't...so after couple of days she admitted that she was depressed for years and years..I have some experience with depression, I was depressed, still am time to time..so I sorta understand all of this..I helped a bunch of people I know with their issues so I sorta know what I'm doing here if you know what I mean..anyways..She won't open up to me or anyone..she isolates herself..also she admitted that she didn't want to appear depressed infront of me so she wouldn't ruin those couple of days we spent together..so now she's suppose to come over to my place for a couple days and spend a new years eve together..she's overwhelmed by work and she's constantly present to arguments at home between her mom and her husband(not her dad) so she was looking forward to it..so today she said she doesn't want to come at all becouse she doesnt "feel like going anywhere"..I think she should come no matter how much she doesn't want to, becouse I know it'll do her good..she'll laugh, feel loved and so on..
 I'm really trying to help her out as much as I can...I know we've been together for a nearly 2 months..and she's my first..I feel useless, I know what she needs..but she won't "cooporate" due to her depression I suppose..I feel my depression getting it's grips back on me..or I just feel so compastionite I don't know...I love her, I would never give up on her..Any advice would be appreciated :( 
 thank you
