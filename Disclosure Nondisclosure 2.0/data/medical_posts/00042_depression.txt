this happens to me time and again, and mainly when i get depressed, but i cannot eat, the thought and sight and even smell of food makes me want to be sick, i will be really hungry but will not eat, i can try and eat, like a sandwich but ill end up gagging and will have to get it into my stomach as fast as i can, and hold the fact im about to regurgitate it in, because i can only force myself to be sick even when im really ill, theres so many thing that i really want to eat, but i cant cause my mind and my stomach is telling me that i cant, before when this used to happen it lasted for a long time, this has been going on for two years constantly on and off, and the longest its happened is for a month and i really do not know what i am going through, i havent been able to go see a gp about them because the surgery where i live is always busy even before the phone lines are open, i would really like to know what is wrong with me and how i can sort it before it gets extreme.
