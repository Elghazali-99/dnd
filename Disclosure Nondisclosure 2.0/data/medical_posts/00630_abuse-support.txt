hi
i am 26 years old.i was incest ed by my brother in my childhood for at least 3 years.he was 4 year older than me and i was 7 years by then.he literally penetrated me at times, and threatened me not to complain to parents.finally i told to mother during one bullying that he asked me to lower my pants and i denied, that's why he is doing so.my parents shocked, and he was made to apologies to mother.(not to me!)putting it sincerely, i had no idea what sex is, all that made me worried at that time was, brother was mothers pet always.(i remember my father saying "she is just not what we think, little ****")
some how the issue settled, and there was a gulf between me and bro, as that time passed i read somewhere it is natural for boys of that age.but there was something incurable inside me.during childhood, i was bullied at school, was terribly afraid of darkness, i had no friends i school, but i managed somehow, i was too good in studies.as the board exam came i had sweating hand, nousia, and stomach ache, and i noticed myself missing class notes,dates and other relevant things, i found myself helpless.i missed the main exam as i forgot the date!!!
what are the problems in an adults caused by emotional unavailability of family? my social life is in chaos.i dont want anyone to be cursed, but i need to fix broken parts inside me.
