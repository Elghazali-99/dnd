I am a 52 year old woman, who had a total hysterectomy 2 years ago. This may sound stupid but I did not know my ovaries were going to be removed. It was a total surprise to me and I was very distraught. When I woke up from the surgery and they ask me how I felt, the first thing I said was I feel odd, like something is not right.  I did not find out my ovaries were removed until about 8 weeks later. I was having a nervous breakdown and ask the doctor to check my hormones. he said you don't have any. Now I am faced with trying to regulate my body chemistry. It has been horrible. For over a year I felt like I was going crazy. I have gained weight. I am taking Estrogen shots once every 3 weeks. But I bought some Black Cohosh and some progestin cream so I think Im going to try that. If I don't feel a whole lot better Im going back to the doctor and see if he can help me feel better. I don't like taking the shots because of the health risk.t I must also consider quality of life. I do feel better in the last 6 months. The brain fog disappeared, I don't feel crazy. I just don't feel as good as I did before the surgery and Im convinced it has to do with getting your hormones properly regulated. One more thing, my hair is much thinner than it was, so Im fighting that battle also. Does anyone have  any suggestions that would help with my plight?
