So my boyfriend and I have known each other for 6 years & been together for a year and a half. Since we've been officially dating he's really done nothing but hurt me and I know it's my fault that I stay and put myself thru it but he's literally a psycho! He cheated on me twice that I knew about and confronted him and I catch him talking to or texting other girls all the time but every time I try to leave he goes nuts! Says he can't live without me, brings our unborn child into it, threatens to stalk me, attempts to hold me hostage til I change my mind about leaving, he will even get violent and try to hold me down or choke me when I'm not giving in to staying with him so normally I just do bc I am scared. We just got into a bad fight bc I found out more of his dirty secrets. I'm bruised up, scratched up, a blood vessel popped in my eye and he even hit my stomach. I had to beg and plead and cause a scene nearly getting the police involved just for him to take me home. I'm safe now and he's at work, but I really want to talk to his mom to see if she can just get him to leave me alone. I've gotten really close with his family but Idk if that is the right thing to do. I just know he will try to make me look like the bad person and he will try to play the victim when all I'm trying to do is protect myself and my son.
