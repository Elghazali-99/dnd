Paranoid about having schizophrenia or actually schizophrenia?
How do I get rid of my fear of having schizophrenia??
Hi, I have ocd and intrusive thoughts and depersonalization and derealization ( I also believe I have anxiety but I'm not sure). Anyways I was in the bathroom and I could swear! I heard my mom talking to my sister on the phone ( there is a lot with my sister going on rn btw) I even heard her say my sisters name. Now I have "heard" things from stress before but not like this! This sounded like she was actually talking to my sister! I'm scared! I'm even crying.
I used to have a fear of being schizophrenic but that has warn off, but now I have a fear of havinf dilutions.... And as soon as my mom swore that she didn't say anything moments ago and didn't hear anyone else I looked it up and... The first thing that came up was delusions! Now I'm even more scared :(
What do I do????? What could this be???
Idk what to do anymore...
My mom looked at me like I was crazy!
UPDATE: I doubt what I see and hear! I don't know what is real :/ or I will be laying down kinda drifting off to sleep and I will keep worrying about this and I will get a thought like a "whisper" saying Marko.... And I dont know... I will question myself like " was that just a though!? Or am I really schizophrenic?!?!" I just kinda shrugged it off as me being paranoid.... But I dont know anymore! It seems like everyday is a new battle. 
I'm tired of living my life in fear! This is NOT a way to live. I feel like I'm "seeing" or "hearing" things! I also have taken a few quizzes and they said that I'm likely to NOT have it.
