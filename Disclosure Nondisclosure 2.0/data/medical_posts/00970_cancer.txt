My thirteen year old daughter has recently been complaining of bad headaches, and constant dizziness, fatigue, and lightheadedness. She also has very cold hands and feet that she says have recently been very numb. Lately, her coordination has been a little off, as she runs into door frames or chairs sometimes (she has glasses so it isn't a vision problem) and she also seems to drop things, such as a pencil, if she holds it for too long. In addition, she almost passed about a week ago, and has experienced that phenomenon a few other times. Whenever she stands up, she says she gets very dizzy and feel like she is going to pass out. Her symptoms have been going on for about a month now. But just a few days ago, she has started talking about pressure on the right side of her head. Many of the symptoms seem like brain cancer symptoms, although she doesn't get seizures, but she does have moments where she has been unresponsive or had horrible shuddering motions. Also, there have been times when she has gotten very confused by simple things, when caught off guard. Is it possible that she could have some sort of brain cancer or tumor?
