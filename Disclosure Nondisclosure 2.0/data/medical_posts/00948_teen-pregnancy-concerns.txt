Ok, so me and my boyfriend were fooling around in his truck. He was fingering me and i was giving him a *******. Heres the thing, when he ejaculated, some of the sperm got on my hands. I wiped it off right after it happened and kept going in what i was doing. We stopped and started driving to Kmart. This may sound gross, butni was playing with my spit because it was sticky and such. But i stopped at an intersection. Kmart was no more then 5 minutes away from where the intersection was. Again i wiped my hands DRY. When we got to kmart i went to the bathroom to clean up, another 4 minutes to get to the bathroom. When i was in there i went to the restroom and then wiped and such, but then i did something stupid. I used my finger to feel around, just barely into my vagina. I stopped and went to wash my hands. As soon as i started washing my hands i realized my mistake. I went straight back into the bathroom and got toilet paper and shoved it into my vagina to try to dry it up in hopes it would catch any semen/sperm i accidentally put in there. What are the chances of me being pregnant??? Oh and to make this a tougher question, the same day this happened i got my period THAT SAME night. Please help me.
