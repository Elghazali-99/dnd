so february 26, was the last time i had unprotected sex. it was for about 30 seconds and he didn't ejaculate. it was the day before my period was expected to arrive. my period arrived normally and since then i had one food adversion. i made a food that had an extreme amount of butter and the whole day, the thought of butter made me nauseated. since, i haven't really had "morning sickness" or any food adversion, and i never really crave anything specific. i had my period the month of march starting march 27, and it was about as long as normal, as well as the one for april 27. i have not noticed weight gain and it's getting around 12 weeks. my period is due this upcoming saturday. i noticed my breasts were a little sore for a few days only about a week and a half ago, and my areolas have not been darker or larger than normal. my urge to urinate is not constant like i have heard people say pregnant women have, about every few hours but i do drink around 2 1/2 cups of coffee every morning which i've read can cause it as well. i just got off work, ate a huge meal and i look like i have a food baby (that's how i describe it because i've never been bloated) . i'm freaked out. i am too afraid to take a pregnancy test and my boyfriend is trying to convince me that i am most likely not pregnant because it was for maybe 30 seconds, if that. if anyone can help me and maybe tell me what some of these symptoms could be it would be great. also, i have felt almost as if my insides are vibrating a little, only when i lay on my side at night. help anyone????
