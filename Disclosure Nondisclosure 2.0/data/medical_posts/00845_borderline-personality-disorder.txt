I am in a relationship that I am starting to be scared of.He shows most all the symptoms of Psychopathic and is abusive.He is emotionally abusive to the max.He is a mental terrorist.He can be sweet and loving then turn in an instant and be verbally mean and abusive making you feel like you are nothing to him and everything is about him and his pleasure not about mine.He wants me to go to a Bar where a woman flirted with him and tell her off and she is  one of those tough women that can fight men and put them in the hospital.He outwardly flirted with her in the bar "eye contact" and when I got upset I said nothing to him but that I did not like it and it has been months since this incident yet he just now went off about things and wants me to tell her off knowing she wiill more than likely put me in the hospital.I am not well I have many illnesses and I am not a fighter.He told me to take a weapon and I told him no I would not be that stupid to get myself in trouble and that he said he would bail me out of jail if necessary.I am not putting myself in that dangerous situation.He told me he will leave me if I do not do as he says and also wants me to go to my EX whom I have had no contact with for 15 years and tell him I never loved him and that I love only him now and forever.And to tell him I  love him and hold him above even my own children who are grown now.He wanted to punch a 70 year old woman who heard him abuse me and told him to straighten up that I am a good person and do not deserve that treatment.He did not punch her because he said  he restrained himself for my benefit.I have heard through his own admiission that he went to court two times with women.One was in a wheel chair claiming he put her there beating her and raping her and the second was his wife of 2 years who also claimed abuse but he is so slick he escaped the charges by manipulating  his wife to lie about the first woman then the wife was not able to get the charges of abuse to stand in court for her own abuse.He has been in my home since Dec 07 and still has not brought his things out of his car..He left all his furnishings in Texas in a storage unit and most everything he has in the apartment was stuff I bought him.He has bought absolutely nothing for me.I was forced ,yes forced to go and fill out a paper stating that this apartments contents are shared by him so that if I made him go he would take half of everything I have.I am disabled and it took a long time to get what I have.He is a truck Driver and I see nothing to help with any bills or anything on this apartment.He has informed me that it is all about him and not a thing about me or my needs or desires.He is way oversexed like 3 times or more a dayWill this man ever change? is it possible?So much has happened and I am sick every time the phone rings or it is time for him to come home because I am never sure of his mood.I have a fluttery stomach due to fear.I want this relationship to work but I feel it is a doomed one.I have given so much to him and given my heart and soul to him and still it seems it is never enough he constantly brings up what I call stored issues that he has stored in his brain and on the cell of past disagreements and supposed infractions on my part which are all in his mind.The last thing I will bring up is looking into his eyes, they are void of any emotion and one night when he could not perform sexually, he began to choke me so hard that I had a dark black ring around my neck .This happened once and I felt my life slipping away when he finally snapped with it and stopped.The next time he tried I screamed and he snapped out of it and I told him how it scared me and he has not done this again at least not yet. Will he? What is a diagnosis for him? Should I be afraid for my life?
