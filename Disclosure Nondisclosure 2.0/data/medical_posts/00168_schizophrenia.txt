Hello.
to say a little about my back ground. I was homeless for about a year. The while being homeless I was diagnosed with schzophinea. I'm in my 20s and I have had the diagnoses for about three years now. I am not much of a talker and i have a hard time trying to get my point across to people.
I am now living in a group home were people here have a range of mental dignoses. The peer leaders and counselors call me "high functionig." Which because I am "high functioning" I find it difficult to live with those that are not the same. I'm also a lesbian.  And I'm trying to find a community where I can be safe, be myself, and not fill like I can't talk to those around me. I find I difficult to make friends in the facility that I'm in now because we don't see eye to eye on things.
I'm now in the process of finding me an apartment because i can't handle the stress living in a group home. I will be living on my own. This will be my first time ever living on my own. And because I'm not a talker I'm finding it difficult to make friends. 
What can I do to cope with living in a group home and prepare myself to live out on my own?
