In a 6 month period my estrogen level went from below 20 to over 2300. What could it be? 
I am a 'healthy' 53 year old female. 5' 5" and 140 lbs.  I have been in menapause for 5 years. (no period). I have taken herbal supplement, "Estroven" since the beginning. I have not had HORRIBLE hot flashes, night sweats or mood swings. However, I have had vaginal dryness. A couple of years ago, I began using Estring 2mg - which helped. I had my hormone levels tested in December  and my doctor said they basically didn't even register. My estrogen level was below 20. I began using bio-identicals, but was not very faithful. I would skip a day or two, then back on it, averaging everyother day. I wasn't noticing a huge difference. I then decided I would make a FAITHFUL effort. I called my doctor and asked if I could have my hormones re-tested. After 6 full weeks of DAILY FAITHFUL USE (applied only to my hips/abdomen) - and 6 months since my last blood test,  my new estrogen level was 2,376!!!!!  My doctor called and had me come in for an immediate ultrasound of my overies - NORMAL!  I will have another blood test today. WHAT ELSE should I be concerned about here - and WHAT ELSE should my doctor be looking for??  By the way, my 'doctor' is actually a nurse practitioner....
