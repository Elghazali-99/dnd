1	I have to admit , I was a sucker for the large quantity , 12 oz , when shopping for hot sauces but now seeing the size of the bottle , it reminds of wingsauce bottle sizes

1	I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality
1	My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than most
1	If you are familiar with the story of CS
1	Lewis ' The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe   this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch
1	If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it
1	I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered which was good and made some cherry soda
1	My only complaint is there was a bit too much redblack licoriceflavored pieces just not my particular favorites
1	Between me , my kids , and my husband , this lasted only two weeks
1	I would definitely recommend you buying it
1	Right now I 'm mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass
1	I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too
1	My dog eats her required amount at every feeding
1	We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away
1	When we realized that we simply could n't find it anywhere in our city we were bummedbr br Now , because of the magic of the internet , we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of itbr br If you love hot sauceI mean really love hot sauce , but do n't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat , grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan
1	Just realize that once you taste it , you will never want to use any other saucebr br Thank you for the personal , incredible service
1	I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy , and the proteinrich , no byproduct food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump
1	My cats have been happily eating Felidae Platinum for more than two years
1	They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food
1	Unfortunately , I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat
1	Six pounds will be around for a while with my son and I
1	I love eating them and they are good for watching TV and looking at movies
1	I like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so I can take my time eating them
1	I am very satisfied with my Twizzler purchase
1	I shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them
1	Twizzlers , Strawberry my childhood favorite candy , made in Lancaster Pennsylvania by Y   S Candies , Inc one of the oldest confectionery Firms in the United States , now a Subsidiary of the Hershey Company , the Company was established in 1845 as Young and Smylie , they also make Apple Licorice Twists , Green Color and Blue Raspberry Licorice Twists , I like them allbr br I keep it in a dry cool place because is not recommended it to put it in the fridge
1	I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me
1	We 've bought these many times from Amazon because we 're government employees living overseas and ca n't get them in the country we are assigned to
1	I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas
1	He loves these , and apparently his staff likes them alsobr There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16ounce bag , and this was well worth the price
1	I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality has n't dropped in all these years
1	I have lived out of the US for over 7 yrs now , and I so miss my Twizzlers
1	When I go back to visit or someone visits me , I always stock up
1	All I can say is YUMbr Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer , more often than I 'm able to buy them right now
1	I would never buy them again
1	I was so glad Amazon carried these batteries
1	I have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size
1	I need them for my garage door openerbr Great deal for the price
1	I got this for my Mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake , and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake   she 's the one with the sweet tooth   they both LOVED these toffees , you would never guess that they 're sugarfree and it 's so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free
1	i was so impressed that i 've ordered some for myself w dark chocolate to take to the office so i 'll eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweetsbr These are just EXCELLENT
1	We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away
1	When we realized that we simply could n't find it anywhere in our city we were bummedbr br Now , because of the magic of the internet , we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of itbr br If you love hot sauceI mean really love hot sauce , but do n't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat , grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan

1	However , my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato
1	No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products , too as a usually noncoffee drinker
1	McCann 's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it
1	It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issuebr br McCann 's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product
1	One thing I do not like , though , is McCann 's use of thickeners
1	Great on a cold morning when you do n't have time to make McCann 's Steel Cut Oats
1	McCann 's Instant Oatmeal holds its texture , has excellent flavor , and is good for you all at the same time
1	This is the best instant brand I 've ever eaten , and a very close second to the noninstant varietybr br McCann 's Instant Irish Oatmeal , Variety Pack of Regular , Apples   Cinnamon , and Maple   Brown Sugar , 10Count Boxes Pack of 6
1	McCann 's Instant Irish Oatmeal , Variety Pack of Regular , Apples   Cinnamon , and Maple   Brown Sugar , 10Count Boxes Pack of 6br br I 'm a fan of the McCann 's steelcut oats , so I thought I 'd give the instant variety a try
1	I found it to be a hardy meal , not too sweet , and great for folks like me postbariatric surgery who need food that is palatable , easily digestible , with fiber but wo n't make you bloat
1	I love McCann 's instant oatmeal   all flavors
1	I WAS VISITING MY FRIEND NATE THE OTHER MORNING FOR COFFEE , HE CAME OUT OF HIS STORAGE ROOM WITH   A PACKET OF McCANNS INSTANT IRISH OATMEAL
1	HE SUGGESTED THAT I TRY IT FOR MY OWN USE , IN MY STASH
1	SOMETIMES NATE DOSE NOT GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO SAY NO , SO I ENDED UP TRYING THE APPLE AND CINN
1	AND COFFEE AND A SLICE OF TOAST AND YOUR READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLDOR THE DAY AT LEAST JERRY REITH
1	I ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter
1	She 's happy , I 'm happy
1	The variety packs taste greatbr br I have them every morning
1	At 030 cents per meal , I do n't understand why everyone on earth is n't buying this stuff upbr br Maple and brown sugar is terrific , followed by apples and cinnamon , followed by regular
1	You do n't get tired of the same ole thing , and they taste greatbr br I just boil water from a small pot , empty the packet or 2 in a bowl , pour in boiling water , and watch it expand to 2x its sizebr br Taste really good and takes minutes to preparebr br Not sure why everyone on earth is n't this
1	It 's all good , that 's for sure , and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regularbr   This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored , as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann 's and other wellknown oatmeals
1	What I personally like about McCann 's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America
1	The Apples   Cinnamon , though , tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add
1	In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twentyseven seconds , so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to usebr   The only bad thing   if you can consider it a bad thing   about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you 'll end up with six tencount boxes
1	This is good if you have a whole family of oatmealeaters , but if you 're a single person alone   well , love oatmeal
1	I have McCann 's Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost 300 per boxbr It is a great product
1	Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon , but we find that none of these are overly sugary
1	We really like the McCann 's steel cut oats but find we do n't cook it up too oftenbr This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenientbr Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing
1	It did n't pass muster with my kids , so I probably wo n't buy it again
1	Though I would n't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste
1	That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of
1	However , I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand   they are both mushy
1	Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller , and the advertising workedlol , I tried them , and shared them with 2 buddies , and we all loved them
1	They are Hot , but not burn your mouth forever hot its a nice temp
1	I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp , Cranberry Horseradish Sauce , Fartless Black Bean Salsa , Apple Cider Jelly , Newton 's Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrupbr br Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts
1	They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms
1	They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work
1	I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence , especially my colleague Greg
1	I 'm going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can , and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I returnbr br The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed
1	It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyesbr br You 'll go nuts over these AssKickin ' Peanutsbr br PS
1	I 'm not sharing the peanuts , not deliberately , and I 'll probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas
1	I roast at home with a stovetop popcorn popper but I do it outside , of course
1	On numerous occasions , we 've had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much
1	Halloween is over but , I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share
1	While the assortment was good , and I did get this on a gold box purchase , the price for this wasbr 34 less at Target
1	Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags
1	I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form
1	Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder , not overly tasty , but quite effective , as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides
1	Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a salty taste , you get a refreshing lemonlime or mango
1	I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes
1	This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ridebr I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor no aftertaste and I actually like the slight carbonationbr I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line
1	For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thingbr br Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat
1	One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of themvoilaproblem solved
1	br br I 've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using thesebr br These guys got it right   they are superbly formulated and simply work
1	I purchased the Mango flavor , and to me it does n't take like Mango at all
1	I 've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades , so I 'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I 've tried
1	It 's not terrible , but it 's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take
1	If you 're impulsive like me , then 6 is ok Do n't get me wrong , the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints
1	In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I 'm lying
1	So I bought 10lbs    These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick , but nothing to strong
1	I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting
1	I am a pastry lover and these were the best I 've ever tasted
1	You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who can not digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience
1	I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugarfree chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell
1	I thought I 'd found sugarfree chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in
1	Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit , all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate
1	My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugarfree popcorn at my local market
1	The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy , new sugarfree treat taste so good , my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener down to the very bottom of the label and read maltitol in tiny little letters
1	In case you 're like me ,   it 's not you it 's the maltitol
1	I would not go out of my way to buy it again
1	I left them in my pantry for a few days , and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey
1	I through them in the fridge and I 've been breaking off hunks ever since
1	They taste good to me , but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again
1	I wo n't order them online again , but if I see them in a store I would pick them up
1	I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer
1	If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor
1	i know i can not make tea this good
1	granted , i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet
1	My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl
1	I 'm 30 now and I love it
1	I purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much , they kept them and would not eat them
1	I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy , but do n't let that scare you off
1	I use it to make my own coffee creamerbr br I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet   but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat , and honestly , I hate to use manufactured food items
1	I really do n't think they are good for the body
1	On the other hand , I hate using cold milk or cream , because I like HOT coffeebr br I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer
1	You will have to play with the ratios   I would not do just the heavy cream , it made the coffee too rich
1	I like mixing 13 of each togetherbr br For flavoring , I bough cocoa bean powder , vanilla bean powder , and caster superfine sugar
1	I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers
1	If you wanted , you could use a fake sweetner powder instead
1	I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars
1	I also use my little food chopperfood processor to blend everything , so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom
1	Let it settle for a bit before opening the top thoughbr br This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors
1	I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolateorange mixbr br All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online
1	Also , would make great housewarminghostess giftsbr br I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it , and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking   but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great
1	While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food , for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice
1	I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help
1	The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly , but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again
1	However , when given to my Boston , who has severe reactions to some food ingredients his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night , scratching
1	I guess you have to try each , until you find what 's best for your pet
1	We have three dogs and all of them love this food
1	We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him , no more hot spots or tummy problemsbr I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping
1	She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has
1	After we got the test back , we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand
1	So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this
1	She still has her environmental triggers , but I am happy she can finally eat something I know wo n't cause her pain
1	My shepherdcollie mix has IBS
1	This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it
1	I will always buy it from Amazonit 's 10 cheaper and free shipping
1	Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell
1	She has awful food allergy 's and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that did n't have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to
1	She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice she seems to like that better
1	We started feeding it to our other dog a Bichon too and she loves it
1	If your dog has allergy 's or stomach issue or if you want your dog to eat better food this is it
1	You will see a difference in your pet
1	I have switched them to a different food due to price a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance
1	This is great dog food , my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him
1	I have a 3 year old and a puppy
1	The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping
1	My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I 've ever met
1	After experimenting with various types of food , I have found she loves natural balance
1	I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it
1	Furthermore , I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring , so I figured why not
1	I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smellsbr br Additionally , I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco did n't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans
1	I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save 20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazonbr br All in all , I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food
1	While I have never eaten it , my dog seems to love it
1	Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains
1	My 112 year old basenjijack russell mix loves this dog food
1	He 's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year
1	Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods , I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full
1	On the normal dog foods , he 'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day the recommended serving for his size , whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 112 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day
1	When you take this into account , you 're actually getting more bang for your buck with the natural dog foods since you do n't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods and a healthier , happier dog , to boot
1	Add in the fact that you can get free , 2day shipping with Amazon Prime
1	The cheap ' you can buy it anywhere ' food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets
1	My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3
1	The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him Iams Lamb and Rice and onto a new kind
1	I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it
1	He would n't eat it , and when he did , it gave him terrible diarrhea
1	The mouth says , How do I love thee , let me count the waysbr If you like apple products a must have item
1	My husband loves these , but I 'm not so crazy about them
1	They are just too sourtart for my taste
1	I 'll eat the crust and hubby takes my filling
1	My kids think they 're great , so maybe it 's just me
1	My husband and I both love them , however , as another customer put it , they are expensive to ship
1	I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed
1	My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes
1	Hence , when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out
1	I 'm going to order the six pack and I 'm a household of one
1	Oh my goodness , when a friend introduced me to this exact brand , I could n't believe how great stuff tasted
1	I loved it so much I bought the six pack
1	I 'm presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods
1	Well , I 've always liked asparagus anyway and I 've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus
1	Now this is my idea of a good diet foodbr br Gary Peterson
1	I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried , but was diappointed in this specific one
1	I 'm so glad that I can buy it now from Amazoncom
1	I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee
1	I have been drinking Royal King 100 Natural Organic Green Tea 100 tea bags x 2 g each as my every day tea for several years now
1	For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night
1	But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me
1	I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together
1	I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit
1	In my opinion , for the price , Royal King 100 Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas
1	I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea although I would if I could afford itbr br Cons On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped
1	So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not
1	It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually do n't get as many boxes as I did with this merchant
1	I depend on my green tea fix everyday
1	It helps curb my eating during the day
1	My Mom and I have given it all friends to try
1	I 'm Italian and I lived in Italy for years
1	I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso
1	I could n't find them anywhere here in the Bay area , so it 's great to have them again
1	In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy
1	They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then
1	They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy
1	It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazonbr br Note it is great to open a bag , smell the contents , pour a glass of milk , then dip the Macines in the milk
1	I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store , then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively
1	The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor 's request , but he totally refused it
1	He still consumes too many calories , the fatty , but at least I know he 's eating good food
1	Of course , I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market , but I just ca n't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there , marketed as being healthy
1	I 'll stay with this for now , but stay tunedbr br I 'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats
1	I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them
1	Garfield still eats a little too much , but he 's just a big cat who does n't exercise much , let 's face it
1	Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she 's so healthy
1	I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select , but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one
1	I 've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it
1	I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his spunk so I decided it was time to start buying him real cat foodnot the garbage in the super markets
1	I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices , and I 'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase
1	My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he 's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft
1	I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals
1	I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat , and this is an excellent food
1	They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step , which is very important to me
1	The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select
1	This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight
1	She does n't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price
1	I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections
1	I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food with water added to it and Uri Ease
1	The combination seems to keeps his UTI 's under control
1	If I switch to another type of dry food , his UTI gets worse
1	Before I was educated about feline nutrition , I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food
1	I always offered both canned and dry , but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food
1	I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats
1	The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova
1	After once again offering several samples from my local holistic pet store Holistic Select was the only one other than the usual Wellness and Innova they would eat
1	For finicky cats , I recommend trying Holistic Select
1	We tried them all , but my cats prefer this especially the sardine version
1	AND and I do n't want to be rude , so I 'll say this as delicately as I can their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores , which is a definite plus for me
1	The health benefits are so obvious   I highly recommend Holistic Select
1	Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book
1	I 've been a fan of Hot   Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time
1	If you enjoy spice , and love ramen , you 'll love this product
1	It 's only 336 per 12 at my Walmart
1	I 've been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid , and I 've never found a better flavor than Hot   Spicy Chicken
1	I LOVE spicy ramen , but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation does n't go away for like 3 hours
1	Not sure if that is healthy or not   and you can buy this at Walmart for 028 , way cheaper than Amazon
1	Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal , finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in
1	I must be a bit of a wuss , because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste
1	If you are n't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough
1	Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup , which is half the price of my local grocery stores , plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors
1	These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you ca n't escape for a real meal
1	This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale
1	i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon
1	I do n't eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison
1	For the convenience of having it delivered to my home I have prime , so I get it in two days and do n't have to pay for the shipping , the price on amazon is n't bad at all , but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store
1	The BEST investment I 've ever made for ginger
1	I 'll be getting more soon   I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies
1	I can not get Australian ginger where I live
1	This compares favorably to Australian Ginger I 've purchased in other cities
1	My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement , Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him
1	I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried
1	He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning
1	I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on
1	Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brandbr If you can get these for 2 to 250 a package with free sh it 's a good dealbr The black and cherry have good taste but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there
1	Infact , I think I am addicted to thembr Buying them in packs of 6 bags   is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag
1	They 're soft , easy to chew , and they do n't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car , in the summer , at the beach , etc
1	Being a fan of Newman 's Pineapple salsa for quite a while , I was looking for a comparable salsa
1	They do n't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces
1	The SALSA smelled delicious , as I think it probably was   but , unfortunately , the person , at AMAZON , that is a packer there is probably several had very little stuffing to work with , especially on the bottoms
1	As I reached for my computer I was told NO RETURNS cause it 's a food item
1	I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag and I found none on their NEW FACE LIFT
1	THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUTTHEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES
1	LIKE I BUY A LOT OF STUFF AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES
1	NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGSbr ESPECIALLY SALSA   IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT
1	These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon
1	They 're kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product
1	But my finace really loves them so that 's where the three stars come from
1	I love to use it for chicken , either baked in the oven OR on the grill
1	This has enough flavor   flair , I 've even used it for dinner parties , only to receive rave reviews from my guests
1	Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself
1	I 'm not sure why Amazon is selling it for 999 for a box of 24 singles
1	such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you
1	I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here
1	Evidently it 's only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall , I could n't find it anywhere in town
1	This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam
1	span classtiny Length 026 Minsbr br spanThe expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product
1	This is one of the many items I reorder on Amazon every month or sobr edit added a short video , so you see what this combination looks likebr br I was wearing one of those headlamps , but I did n't do a good job focusing on the tunabr I should film it over , but it does n't look like many people view this product anyway
1	I 've never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches Starkist and Chicken of the Sea
1	I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning
1	these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion   make a great on the go snack , and really satisfying with the tomato
1	I have always purchased StarKist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace
1	Excellent quality , and no need to ' dress it up'br br I put it the micro on about 20 power for 1 minute and Shazambr br I believe a little heating brings out the flavor
1	I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it
1	I have n't made anything with it yet , just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent
1	I do n't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere , but they were so old that they would n't cook
1	I had to throw half of them out , because the skins were damaged , a clear sign of dried beans past their prime
1	Unfortunately , they taste nothing like banana runtsnor do they even taste good
1	The item over all was fine , but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smaller
1	I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme
1	If you want more than 25 small bags , I would purchase a larger bag
1	I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine
1	I am French and live in the US , br and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity
1	Savora is another hidden gem you can bringbr back
1	I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious
1	I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that , I love this product
1	I could n't wait to try the 88243 Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs , creamy sour cream , Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel
1	Now , I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes , but , let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really takes the cake with size , price , quality and tastebr The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition
1	I could n't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast , for three days
1	Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you 've got the perfect breakfast treat
1	I used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 56 years ago
1	This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going
1	I thought these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad
1	When the season for fresh lemos is out , this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshmentsbr br I will continue buying it
1	I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every daybr br I will buy this product again and again
1	If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommendedbr br I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation
1	After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another placebr br Love this stuff
1	I bought these at Grocery Outlet here in the Seattle Tacoma are for 400 a case of tweleve not paying 3800 Yes 3 for a dollar
1	WE have been looking for natural ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule
1	I drank half the first night and that was plenty for me
1	After about 30 minutes , I was ready for bed
1	I woke up refreshed and with no sleepydrug hangover , so that is a huge bonusbr br I gave the product 3 stars instead of the 5 it deserves as their packing job was marginal at best
1	We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic
1	And an added bonus   the high protein and fiber level I calculate 23 g fibercookie fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lowerbr br I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it
1	We had trouble finding this locally   delivery was fast , no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores
1	They harden up at room temperature , hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart , and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through
1	Personally , I do not like cheesecake too rich for me but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous , I will admit
1	Cherries , strawberries or sliced mangos are nice , but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons , that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cakebr br I use a base of sponge cake , baked in a shallow form , but other bases can be pate sucre a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie that works well in those fluted , straightsided forms
1	You can also make minitarts in a muffin pan , prebaking each mold with a layer of pie crust even commercial crust works , though again , I prefer pate sucre , it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb
1	Some people put a layer of creme patisserie , which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour , below the fruit and I happen to think these taste bestbr br If you get into baking , this glaze is a musthave on the shelf
1	The ingredients are vegan tapioca starch , carrageenan , dextrose , cream of tartar , locust bean gum , so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake , you can use this on top , as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base
1	My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone
1	I 've only had it for a few days and for 5 its totally worth it
1	My sisters all take ganocafe but now I 'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee
1	I will follow up on this product in a few weeks
1	Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better   I bought this to try something other than these two , but I probably wo n't get this again
1	Another one of my favorites , if you want to try it out though NOT organic , is ' Africafe pure instant coffee '
1	I eat 2 of these after lunch because they are so small and I find this sufficiently resolves the problembr br They 're sugar free sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow which is great and they 're tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunchbr br This is a good bulk value buy and I 'd highly recommend the mints themselves
1	I like these better than the regular Altoids , but they 're even more costly , so you 'd better like them
1	These little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great dealThere perfict for on the goFifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary alongAnd there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugarThe price of twelve dollars was very resonableAlso there great for shareingIf you are looking for a mint try these onesYoull be glad you did
1	Prosbr packaging , shipping , pricebr sold about a year before its expiration date enough for me to eatshare 9 boxesbr not too fresh like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form
1	Be careful not to eat too many of them in one day , as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a LAXATIVE
1	Even with small containers , they do n't fill them up
1	I love , and use the empty containers for medicineadvil in my purse , desk , suitcase
1	Tiny and powerful without burning my mouth
1	My mother in law likes these and Walgreens quit carrying them
1	It was great i could get them on Amazon
1	I keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to
1	Some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet
1	When I find someone who keeps coming back for more I just give them their own tin
1	One coworker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes
1	Like I said , they re a real hit
1	Since I would n't be able to keep my hands off a candy dish , this is a good alternative to have around and it 's nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch
1	I gave the item 4 stars because they are n't as tasty as the sugar version of the mints but what sugar free item is as good as it 's full sugar counterpart
1	and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove although I totally get why they wrap it   it still does n't make it easy to deal with
1	It 's full , but compactbr br I have n't run out yet , and probably wo n't for a couple months , but I ca n't wait to buy it again
1	I loved these Wintergreen Altoid Smalls so much , I had to come write a review
1	I definitely prefer them over the regularsize Altoids and will continue purchasing them
1	I use them as favors and everyone loved them
1	Driving cross country , if someone cuts me off , I turn to my daughter with my hand out and say Wintergreen Me
1	She pulls one out , puts it in my hand , and all is right with the world
1	I 'm not a dragonbreath person , but still , one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath
1	Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while   maybe 15 minutes
1	we have fed our cats a lot of stuff
1	They loved the Purina
1	They loved the Nutro
1	They love whatever we feed thembr br This review is based on what we , their affectionate owners love
1	Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they did n't have to chew it to swallow itbr br This Felidae has done the trick
1	We 're now loyal Felidae consumersbr br Additionally , the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with catallergies
1	I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it
1	I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which   she ate the Felidae and left the old food
1	She 's now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now , off the old food entirely , and she is a much sweeter , happier cat
1	I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested , or something
1	In any case , I am a happy purchaser of Felidae
1	We have three cats , the youngest is about eleven years old , another is fifteen and our oldest is , well ancient
1	When he lays down , he looks like a footstool
1	The other two are arthritic and skinnybr br Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs , I figured that we 'd give it a try for our cats
1	I 'd had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problemsbr br Buster , the youngest , is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats
1	However , the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really feeling better since we changed their food to Felidae
1	Even Prissy , the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her , where before when she was on Purina One , all she wanted to do was to sleepbr br I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems , it 'll be more effectivebr br However , the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life
1	We worked this kibble in over time , slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junkfood brand until the bowl was all natural
1	As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae , and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues
1	br br Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home
1	We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal
1	It has been a year since then and they are better
1	Then the formula for this food changedbr br We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us
1	We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food
1	Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and have n't suffered one bit like our dogs havebr br Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating
1	We have 5 rescued and fixed cats , none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formulabr br I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal
1	As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals , and tell me not to buy it
1	I ca n't even remember the first time I tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but I have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite
1	My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us
1	It definitely makes you sweat a bit when you 're eating it
1	It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I do n't think I would buy it again due to the heat
1	We prefer the milder McCormick 's brand of Fajita mix
1	I 've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it was n't as spicy as this mix isbr br If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind
1	To me it was more than medium hot but not by too muchbr br I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it 's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it
1	You take a plastic bag , a couple of tbs of vegetable oil , 14 cup water and mix the seasoning , water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes
1	In the meantime , it says to stir fry your veggies peppers and onion but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I do n't think it affected quality or taste
1	I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oilbr br I have one more package of this to use and next time I 'm going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more
1	A friend who 'd been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago
1	Even took me over to the store and bought me a pound
1	I 've been drinking Earl Grey , English Breakfast , Irish Breakfast , Lapsang Souchong , Assam , etc
1	Aside from the Lapsang Souchong , I think this is a great replacement for all the rest
1	My current favorite afternoon tea
1	Unless you 're extremely jaded or a tea snob , you 'll love it
1	I drink this tea plain without sugar or milk , and it has a pleasant aromabr br The price from Amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store
1	So the label Imperial Blend kind of implied the herbbr br I am not exactly a black tea drinker , so this tea is a surprise , and affordable too
1	I usually prefer White Chinese tea , like White Peony , but it is more expensive , and requires lower temperature water
1	I 've tried a variety of Ahmad tea
1	Not because I particularly like this brand , but they are just easier to come across
1	The Imperial blend , I believe , is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones I 've tried
1	I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea , and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced
1	I buy the threepacks as needed from Amazon and go through them rapidly
1	My family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too , try one box of it and you will love it too
1	I think I have tried just about every Bloody Mary mixer on the market at one time or the other
1	I use 12 and12 with V8 for a milder version , or the best is a Bloody Caesarbr Half mix , half clamato
1	I started drinking the power slim tea when I was on the HCG diet to help curb cravings
1	Since I liked it so well , I tried some of the others and I am now hooked
1	They are so satisfying that I drink them all the time
1	The Energy gives you that extra pickmeup in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day , no matter how long
1	I 'm trying several of the Wu Yi teas
1	I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day
1	i can not live without this citron falksalt , it is wonderful on watermelon , fish , almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does
1	You 'll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this
1	The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker   which is not bad , except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese tastebr br What was a HUGE disappointment
1	The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2 smaller all around   leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreadsbr br What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and ecofriendly packaging
1	They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers
1	The other crackers like Sesame Tarragon give you a littlebr more bang for your buck and have more flavor
1	I have been hunting , training , showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years , with multiple National Champions
1	I have been highly satisfied with Eukanuba 's quality and the results I have obtained feeding their foods
1	My recent purchases are with WAG , through AMAZONcom
1	Their prices are the best I have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock
1	The recommendation when we bought our puppies lhasabichon mix and lhasapoodle mix was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned
1	This is a somewhat expensive food so I ca n't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed homebr br Let me just say this , I have had small dogs before
1	Usually when they 're sitting on our laps but , you know
1	They 're dogsbr br When we got through the first bag of this stuff , we purchased more on amazon
1	It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of I think a 15 lb bag at Petco
1	I mean , they loved the food , do n't get me wrong and they loved it more when we 'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food
1	Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I 'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down ca n't blame the food itself for gluttonybr br Eventually , we switched their food
1	I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful they said up until 1 year
1	Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow
1	Granted , they do n't like it as much , but we humans like it a whole lot better
1	A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertastebr br In the 20 years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed
1	The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the yearsbr br I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here thanks Amazon
1	because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away
1	The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb much cheaper than I can find locallybr br This is a great tasting tea , which I am happy to recommend
1	If you like the Ceylon tea variety , you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this teabr br I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here thanks Amazon
1	and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20 years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed
1	The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the yearsbr br The current deal for the pack of 4 is very good cheaper than I can find locallybr br Highly recommendedbr br NOTE This listing 's description is confusing
1	I 've been enjoying this tea for years
1	My local store went out of buisinessThanks Amazon
1	I have done it in the past 25 years and it 's a habit of mine
1	Ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and I highly recommend it if you like black tea
1	I think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so
1	I have tried it out despite the other review and I found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either Russian or Italian groceries
1	I 've been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years , usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas , where many MiddleEastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas , usually at 57 for a pound box
1	So , you get a lot of tea for the money , but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags , they are not that much worse
1	If you want great packaging , forget it   they ship fast , and the kups are just tossed loose in a box
1	Once you 've tried some random sampler packs and now are overloaded with decafs , extra bolds , or teas , this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want
1	Received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what I ordered
1	This was my second order and I 'll be ordering this item again
1	a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavorsa few i ca nt find anywhere else so def worth the price
1	If used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack
1	I 've just been mixing a 14 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great , but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next
1	I think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well
1	I 'm excited to add more of the SuperFoods to my diet in this fast and easy way
1	Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem
1	I have been using this product for over a year
1	I use it maybe once a week at the most
1	I drink 12 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how I feel
1	IMO this does n't replace my am coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when I start to fade
1	I 've been drinking Guayaki Yerba Mate teas for years
1	I felt energized within five minutes , but it lasted for about 45 minutes
1	I could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money
1	Yes , it 's probably healthier than 5Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if you 're looking to avoid a caffeine overload , this is still not for you
1	I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL   probably lower than other unhealthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands bc they contain too much caffeine andor sugar
1	If you do not react well to caffeine , Guayaki is not a good buy either
1	I definitely feel an energy boost w 1 full Guayaki shot but not w out all the other caffeine side effects   irritability , nervousness , moodswings
1	Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee
1	Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your bodyweightbr br Side note   if you want to feel energized during the day , have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy , fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy
1	I loved the Roasted Almond , Roasted Pecan and the Peanut Butterbr br I will definately buy from this seller again
1	I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues
1	When I called to report the situation to the company , Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab
1	Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund , including shipping
1	This product has a strong aftertaste of Crayola crayonsbr br I am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes
1	Upon opening the plastic container , the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room , and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in itbr br I suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as I have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchasedbr br To date , my favorite coconut oil is distributed by Barleans
1	Had this shipped to my sister who follows a glutenfree eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets
1	These are healthy and my mixed Llasa , Tibetan Terrier adores them
1	And they are healthy and his breath does n't smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products
1	A great healthy chew for my 9 wk old beagle , Rio
1	He loves the taste and it sure beats my arm
1	Once I found it I look no further , it 's the only sugar I use
1	I have used and liked Sugar in the Raw for many years , after being introduced to it in a Starbucks
1	I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar
1	When they get a better crop , I 'll go back to purchasing Sugar in the Raw
1	Sugar in the Rawtm Please Harvest Cane wo Burningbr To be delivered to HCSbr Dear Sugar in the Raw folks , br br We who buy your product care about the environment
1	And we 'd like to know that you care too
1	When you burn the cane fields on Maui , it adds to the CO2 and worsens climate change
1	And the smoke from your burning is damaging the lungs of your workers , your workers ' children and the residents of Mauibr br We love your product and want you to change to noburn harvesting so we can continue to buy it , knowing we are n't contributing to Global Warming and lung diseasebr br
1	I also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar
1	I used to buy this sugar for years
1	I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar , and other brands in the local food store that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or somethingbr br HOW did i find out
1	I needed just a sweet water few days ago
1	The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS
1	U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as wellbr br I 'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice
1	But if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it , or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it , it is a great product
1	Use this in your coffee , cereal , etc for a week and you 'll never go back to white sugar , white sugar will taste terrible
1	Plus from what I 've read , this Raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our dietsbr br The product was delivered fast and wellpackaged
1	I wish I could find Raw sugar cheaper
1	I would be happy to buy in bulk , but this is the cheapest I have found
1	I thought this was a great buy , but as noted by Scott D , the molasses content was not up to par
1	Unfortunately what I purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and I have twelve 24 ounce bags
1	I guess I 'll watch for the next crop
1	We 've used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good
1	It did n't look like the box was damaged so I ca n't tell how it happened , but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I opened it
1	Not sure what the solution is and I 'd order it again , but if it happens again , I 'd switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag
1	My spouse and I buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious
1	Or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill
1	I 've had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty
1	I 've served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them
1	It 's also nice to have something glutenfree for friends who are borderline diabeticbut I would eat them anyway
1	I found these crisps at our local WalMart   figured I would give them a try
1	They were so yummy I may never go back to regular chips , not that I was a big chip fan anyway
1	I only buy it on special occassions because I know I 'll eat the whole bag
1	I paid 179 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today
1	I bought them because brown rice is a good carb
1	As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients
1	I wo n't buy these again   I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste
1	I use the Rotel Mild and I LOVE this product so muchit saves me on a daily basis
1	If you 're trying to cook lower fat , healthier foods and in a HURRY , this stuff makes it so much easier
1	It tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans , heat and eatbr br or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup
1	I also prefer this to most canned salsas , so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid offbr br None of my local grocery stores carry it at all , nor do they carry anything like it
1	So I have to pay Amazon 's inflated price to order this by the case
1	I do n't like that I 'm paying a higher price , but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the product
1	i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for 1
1	however , it 's only ONE dollar at the local grocery and    twenty eight dollars per twelve pack   these are running almost two and a half dollars eachbr br as i said , TOO EXPENSIVE
1	sigh   i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local costbr br take care , br lee
1	Nothing wrong with the product , but I sure had to mix it with lots of other ingredients to make it edible to me
1	In Texas I was called a babymouth   not into very spicyhot foods
1	1 can of this milder Rotel , mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes , was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips
1	For the record , I 've had 5 hour energy , and that tastes FAR worse
1	Red Bulls a day for the caffeine , and this gives me far better energy , and is much more subtle
1	My preference is black coffee , but I ca n't drink 812 cups a day anymore
1	Overall , Steaz does it right real organic ingredients in moderate amounts , and they create big results
1	I have to get up really early to work out before work and I get super tired by the middle of the afternoon
1	I was drinking one 5 hour energy , usually extra strength , each day
1	My husband got me to try this and I was skeptical , but for me it works as well if not better than the 5 hour energy and does n't give me that jittery almostheadache feelingbr br I do n't mind the tasteit reminds me of the inside of a fig newton mmm
1	At my grocery store they were almost 3 each , yikebr br And it 's organicso I can feel good about it , right
1	I bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there
1	He takes one in the mornings and works hard all day
1	I am a energy junkie and I 'm not sure if this works or not , but what I do know is that the taste is not the greatest
1	I do drink the steaz energy drink and I think I get the same results
1	If you want an organic energy shot , your choices are this one from Steaz and the assorted flavors from Guayaki
1	Guayaki Yerba Mate is actually in the Steaz energy shot and energy drinks , and they both use Sambazon Acai , so there are some similarities in ingredientsbr br Great energy burst for 4 hours on a Steaz Energy Shot , and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards
1	This will help me cut down on my iced coffees , which are not helping my calorie intakebr br Already ordering 12packs on subscribe and save , 2 per month
1	I was looking for a natural energy shot that works , and I found it
1	Steaz energy shot is my favoritebr br I recently had gastric bypass surgery , so tons of sugar is a nono
1	And I 'm also allergic to Sucralose Splenda so most other energy drinks are outbr br I tried Bazi energy shots and they did n't work as well as Steaz , and definitely did n't taste as well
1	These have a taste that 's almost like CocaColanot bad at allbr br If you 're looking for natural energy , give these a try
1	I had tried both of the Guayaki energy shots and I do n't like the taste of either of them
1	I like them cold for sure
1	My husband and I take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we do n't have to make stops for coffee
1	We normally split them
1	I 'm really sensitive to caffeine , even the natural kind so I get a little weird if I drink the whole thing but that 's the same for coffee too for me
1	You can feel good about putting this in your body
1	I 've been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon
1	So , I asked the nice lady at the counter of my local Whole Foods Market , for something that will give me that extra energy I need to get through the daybr br She excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle
1	Over three hours after drinking whatever that was , my brain is still working at unnatural speeds
1	To summarize my experiences I believe this worksbr br She did explain that I needed to drink plenty of water with it , which I personally feel helped the energy level
1	So if you 're feeling tired during the day and hate coffee , give this a shot   preferably before you eat anythingbr br Woot
1	It had a terrible aftertaste at first , but now that I know what to expect , I am getting used to it
1	I am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy I need without all the chemicals found in other beverages
1	It 's helped me kick my addiction to Diet Coke and other aspartamelaced caffeinated beverages
1	I 've tried 5hour energy , red rain , NOS , and other energy shots
1	Sometimes I wonder what I 'm really putting into my body with some of the other brands
1	I purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years
1	I first found Steaz Berry Energy Shots at a local organic market
1	I bought two bottles , which cost just under three dollars each
1	I am very sensitive to sucralose Splenda which is in so many energy drinks these days I also hate the taste
1	I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners
1	I have several medical conditions , including fibromyalgia , which saps me of energy and causes intense pain
1	I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done
1	No caffeine jitters , even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottlebr It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores , so I started looking online for a bulk price
1	I am so thrilled to have found the Pack Of 12 on Amazon
1	I signed up for Amazon Prime specifically for this product , hah
1	I have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all , its also the best taste , others taste like medicine , this one has a tea fresh taste
1	I drive OTROver the Road truck and this helps to keep me alert
1	I 'm on a autoship which i like
1	My wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style
1	I moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training
1	I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an AWESOME Energy Drink
1	I use this product daily , and it provides a steady stream of energy
1	I 've been buying and drinking this for over a year now , and the energy boost is excellent , with a continuous , 6hour effect
1	I like 5hr Energy , I find Rain ok and so I thought I 'd try this product based on the reviews
1	I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched really
1	But worst of all , within an hour I was yawning and drowsy
1	I wished I could have used it for more than one occasion , but it did n't last
1	I did use it to make 30 suckers for my daughter 's first birthday
1	I would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions , but for the price it did n't matter to me that much
1	You HAVE to try the VANILLA Tootsie Rolls
1	I did and I am quite addicted , it is too easy to prepare , it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with
1	If you like this type of Couscous like I do , then give this one a tryIt can be eaten hot , room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors , it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed
1	I cooked the Couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time
1	So I decided to try good ole Amazoncom and selected this product
1	I know how I normally cook Couscous so tried 34 cup water to 1 cup couscousbrought to a boil and let sit , covered for 5min
1	I would n't even think of buying this product unless I know the price per unit
1	I love ordering whole bean coffee on Amazon
1	I like this so much that this my first product review
1	I have to say that I 'm usually not a big fan of flavored coffee , but I thought I would give it a try
1	When my husband started grinding it up , I could smell it throughout the house
1	I do wish it came already ground as I do n't have a grinder and use a blender instead
1	This brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time   I 've believe the company is local
1	I 'm particularly fond of the Turtle Sundae but all the flavors are good
1	I ca n't say that I 've had a bad onebr br As it turns out , it 's less expensive to order it from Amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local Walmart to get it
1	Try it , if you like rich , flavored coffee , you 'll like it
1	I consume about a jar every two weeks of this , either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip
1	It is hot , but after awhile the medium Salsa Suprema was too mild for me I thought maybe I 'd cut down how much I ate by going to the hot Salsa Ranchera
1	The similarly hot Salsa Victoria is a duller taste to me , I guess earthy
1	I do n't like to go hotter than this because the sauces I 've tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot this happens to me with Tabasco sauce , for examplebr br A drawback is La Victoria does n't make a larger bottle of Salsa Ranchera nor Salsa Victoria , nor do they sell them in   or Sam 's Club
1	service was great , but I meant to buy Swiss Chalet chicken SAUCE not the Marinade br br Love the sauce   have yet to try the marinade
1	Use frequently as we like to do Asian dishes at least once a week
1	Put this in my husbands stocking for Christmas and it was a hit
1	You get what you pay for
1	I can stick them in my purse and take them to work
1	I usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee , but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because I wo n't allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup
1	I think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from Amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping
1	Even though we are International Delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product
1	I could n't believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups but many of the Amazon creamer options both Coffeemate and International Delight had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packagingbr br That was not an issue here
1	Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen , one in the bathroom we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig   best idea my husband ever had , and one at work , with a reserve for whichever runs out firstbr br If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options , this is your best bet
1	The only reason I stop ording is bacause I went to sugar free , and at that time he did not have it
1	But for those of you that do n't have to watch there fat in take , I would get this product from them
1	They 're great because they do n't require refrigeration
1	I found these new spring PopTarts and bought them on a whim
1	My kids and I were amazed and delighted at the fun , colorful , amazingly detailed artwork on these PopTarts
1	Tie with a ribbon for a bright thinking of you this spring gift
1	I went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee
1	I paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money
1	I had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it
1	I throw it right away , i coudl not drink it
1	It may take me a while to finish the entire gallon , but I will definnantly order again
1	Bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months , and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat
1	I cut up cantaloupe , apple , banana even used sweet potatoes a few times just whatever I could get at the restaurant and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat
1	It 's great because I did n't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks , and he got to try out new foods
1	My son started using it around six months , and he really enjoys it
1	He DOES get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon , but whatever
1	Anyway , I also had trouble cleaning it , until I tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush
1	It takes some time , but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender , or cut it up , then clean it up off him , the chair , the floor , the dog , me , well you get the picture
1	My daughter love itbr I do n't think is difficult to wash , I mean , is not like just toss water and that 's it but , come on
1	I could n't get the food pieces out to save my life
1	I tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests
1	I loved this product for fruits and other food that I did n't want my new baby to choke on
1	I also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething
1	I love , love , love the idea of this product and my little one loves , loves , loves to use it
1	She gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and I do n't have to worry about her choking
1	Bananas however , have pretty much destroyed a couple of them
1	While I love this product , I think that next time I will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags
1	While my daughter was interested in it for a little while , she eventually lost interest
1	I may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts
1	I know a few people with little ones that use these and they LOVE them
1	I ordered these for my coffee themed wedding
1	When they arrived I had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good
1	They were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables
1	Unfortunately , I keep them in a candy dish in the office and they are going fast
1	I have been following Weight Watchers and lost 50 pounds and am at my goal
1	Whole Foods carries this item and it 's been on sale there for 999 that 's Canadian dollars , too , as I 'm in Canada
1	It 's even cheaper on Baker 's Box 's own website , and they 're the company selling this product through Amazon
1	I thought Amazon was where you could find competitive prices
1	The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India
1	I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than I 'd original expected
1	Just add to your sugary concoction be it a baking good , a dessert or a drink to either give strawberry flavor or add to existing flavor , and presto , just about everyone will be licking their lips and maybe fingersbr br For those interested , I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid
1	For really high end desires , I go with the Apollo Olive Oils from California
1	I had n't tried or heard of till recently Weavers not it 's my favorite
1	I am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and have n't found one yet , they 're all so darned smooth
1	Having always been a strict Peet 's Coffee lover , I was reticent to switch brands but Weaver 's won my heart
1	Go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of Weaver 's Peru Organic Whole Bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee
1	And when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they do n't know better , take along a travel mug filled with Weaver 's coffee from home and enjoy a real Cup of Joe
1	As a Peets Coffee fanatics we learned that Weavers roaster was the roaster for Peet 's and we are hooked
1	I already reviewd the French and Organic blend , but I must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drinkbr Met the weavers team at the Warner Brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast
1	Since them we are fansbr You wo nt be dissapointed
1	I like eating these whenever I need an energy boostbr It has everything that I am searching for in a , To Go Snackbr Fiber plus Chocolate is never a bad thing
1	My fiance loves these dark chocolate and nut granola bars and all the grocery stores around us do n't carry them anymore
1	Once again , Amazon came through and he could n't be happier
1	I was buying Quaker Oats granola bars but these Nature Valley chewy bars are better tasting , they make a great snack when I 'm on the go
1	Now , I came keep the husband 's breakfast ready as he runs out the door in the mornings
1	Nantucket Blend coffee is one of my favorites
1	Green Mountain Nantucket Blend KCups make a very good cup of coffee in my a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB000AQPMHAKeurig B40 B40 Elite Gourmet SingleCup HomeBrewing Systema
1	This is a very smooth tasting brew that my wife prefers over the a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB0029XDZIKCoffee People , Donut Shop KCups for Keurig Brewers Pack of 50 Amazon FrustrationFree Packaginga I generally drink in the morningbr br These are good on both Small and Large cup settings as wellbr br Highly Recommendedbr br CFH
1	When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas , we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors
1	Of the 12 pods we had in the box , four were Green Mountain Coffee brand
1	I 'd never tried anything from this company before , but from what I had researched online , they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as wellbr br Unfortunately , I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee
1	We tried their Dark Magic , Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming , to say the least
1	I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogtherbr br We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of wastenotwantnot , I figured I 'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely
1	And I 'm glad I didbr br The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee
1	It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent unlike some of the other GM blends we tried
1	I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our goto Caribou Blend pods
1	All in all , this is a very standard cup of coffee which , while it is n't anything new or exciting , is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we 've been able to test out
1	When we run out of all the pods we 've accumulated , I 'll probably pick up a box of these as wellbr br Now that I know Green Mountain is n't completely disappointing I 'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB004I3Y4IEGreen Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast , KCup Portion Pack for Keurig KCup Brewers , 24Counta to try as well and see how it goes from therebr br If you 're looking for a goto choice , this is your cup
1	Green Mountain is my favorite brand
1	Nantucket is my favorite coffee from Green Mountain
1	I was looking for a replacement for Timothy 's Kona Blend which is no longer carried on Amazon
1	This coffee from Green Mountain is very nice , but not strong enough for me
1	If you like milder coffees , then this one is for you
1	One of Green Mountains best blends of coffee in my opinion , love it for your everyday blend , perfect stregnth , excellent blend
1	This is just Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup , the best I have ever eaten , with large hearty chunks of chicken , and vegetables and nice large noodles
1	I am so glad Amazon carries this product
1	I just ca n't find it here in Vermont
1	I have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking , I love the regular , I use it on everything
1	You wo n't be sorry you tired it , great for dipping bread and cooking omelet , and green beans
1	Like most people , I 've been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it
1	The refreshed taste of this Ketchup is a great update , and now leaves me disappointed when I 'm given Heinz while out at a restaurantbr br For you Heinz die hard fans out there , this is not the ketchup for you
1	But for those of you who wish you always knew what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste found in Heinz , be sure to give this Ketchup a trybr br Do n't forget the spiced variety
1	Purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first Sir Kensington experience is definitely the way to go
1	It is so good I have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy
1	I have been using porcini mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years
1	The Roland extra fancy porcinis that I purchased from you are the best that I have ever used , including the mushrooms that I bought in Italy and transported back to the USA
1	While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones , the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus
1	Additionally , I find the broth used to rehydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews
1	To save time and add flavor , I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without rehydrating them
1	The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroominfused waterbr br This was the first time I used the Roland brand got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse , and would certainly buy them again
1	If you are a peanut lover , these are for you
1	Six people on my Christmas gift list ask for these every year
1	They made an absolutely excellent cashew brittlebr br My order took just over a week to arrive , which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country
1	They came double bagged in clear plastic bags , and in two 5 lb portions
1	This was highly convenient since I could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until I was ready to work with itbr br Great value for the price
1	I mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they do n't have to look perfect anyways
1	For the price , they are a great deal about half of what I find them for in the store
1	I will admit , I was a bit sceptical when I ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good or bad the cashews would bebr br The order came in pretty fast   like 3 days
1	They were in 2 5 lb bags sealed with clear tape first I found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal considering the second pack stayed fresh till I opened them
1	The trick is to actually keep them in an airtight box so that they stay fresh longerbr br The only negative I can think of is that the price went up abt 500 for the 10 lb since I bought them
1	I bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that I have at a couple of restaurants
1	I actually ordered 3 cans instead of the gift tin , so he could take one to work , or his place , and stay fresh longer
1	Although I do n't think freshness will be an issue , they wo n't last longlol
1	My cat will go for a day , probably longer , have n't tryed it , but he 'll walk right by this stuff every time , even when I know he 's hungery
1	I swear he 'd rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it
1	I have used it in Ham and beans and seasoned greenbeans
1	I did not realize this when I ordered it and can not return it because it is a food item
1	Before I discover this mix on Amazon I always bought it in Whole Food Storebr I like this mix and when I am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffybr Just one small secret Try to add the Seltzer water instead of regular one
1	I appreciate the fact that I can buy this product online and have free shipping
1	Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake mix is my favorite mix
1	But we have a lot of fun with this Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake   Waffle Mix
1	We serve them as is with fried eggs and REAL maple syrup , a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB002483TSQButternut Mountain Farm Vermont Pure Maple Syrup , Grade A Dark Amber , 1 Pint Juga , or with warm strawberry jam and whipped cream , or Cool Whip , or add brown sugar to the mix to change the flavor and make a crispy waffle , or add 14 cup sugar and 14 cup malted milk powder a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB001EQ4HVCCarnation Malted Milk , Original , 13Ounce Jars Pack of 3a , for awesome gourmet pancakes and waffles like they serve at the Hilton
1	Its handy to have extra bags on hand , too , and you ca nt beat the Subscribe and save price
1	We are glad we found this mix as we make pancakes without eggs for my son who has an allergybr They taste fine for our family we like them many ways
1	I love the flour however Amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess
1	I had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth , it 's that bad
1	I 'm not even sure I would cook with this
1	It is subtle and sweetIt 's one of the better chamomile teasbr If you find it hard to sleep at times , a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may helpbr If you really like sweet taste try Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Teabr I highly recommend both
1	In the past I used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch , chocolate chips , Oreo cookies , caramel et al , because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale
1	Now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the Santa Cruz Organic Mint Chocolate syrup really stands out but does n't overpower the flavor of the ice cream
1	And because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste , I use it sparingly , so this 155 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups I used
1	There are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are
1	I use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half , tastes great
1	I sent a case to my Mother recently diagnosed with Diabetes , and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties
1	I ordered this product at the same time as the Kirkland Signature salmon
1	Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water approximately half a cup , it 's not enough for a good cup of tea , so I use two
1	Sometimes little out of the way stores have itBut i also love the chicken , pork chop bagsEvery store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market
1	Our local grocery went out of buisness and so I could not find this product till I looked here
1	All of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but McCormacks bland and tasteless seasoningsbr br This is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find
1	If you like Oreo 's or the Oreo cakester , then you 've got to try the Double Stuff cakesters
1	I was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when I told them I bought this
1	Last time I looked , it was 25 a 500 g jar in British stores in LACounty , or about 4x what it costs in England
1	The Amazon supplier was quick and efficient , and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year or would have , if I did n't decide to send one of the two jars to my son in Japan
1	I put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried
1	I am going back to Nature 's Path Buttermilk pancake mix
1	The only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast
1	The cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery storebr br I have no complaints but I also now have no more cookies
1	We ate them all
1	I was not expecting to like these cookies as much as I do
1	I like chocolate chip cookies well enough , but I really prefer a soft cookie to crisp ones
1	I have to say these Famous Amos cookies have pertty much turned me around
1	They are n't fattening and they 're good for you , right
1	Great if you are cutting back on fat , they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them
1	I have never met a Kettle brand chip I did not like
1	After buying bags one at a time at a hefty markup at nearby stores , I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon
1	I was very pleased with the price and the productsbr br These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy they have a slowbuilding spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag , which I 'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few timesbr br The chips arrived wellpacked and fresh
1	They had nearly a year of time before they expired , which is pretty impressive for chipsbr br Most importantly , the priceperbag was much , MUCH better than any local store could do , although I live near an expensive city , so that may play a role in the price differencebr br I would n't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out
1	one of the best chips that you can buyand i 've tried all the kettle varieties , and many others
1	Perfect with a sandwich or alonebr If you like being addicted , these are the chip for you
1	We eat Kettle chips by the truck load at my house , we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite , never enough bags to get us to our next shipment
1	I just wish Amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save
1	If you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself
1	I have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day
1	Kettle chips are the BEST nonbaked chips I have eaten
1	I decided to try the sweet onion chips , since I 've never had them
1	I will definitely reorder these , as I mentioned above , they are the BEST I have ever eaten
1	I can not say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips
1	Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors , and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water
1	I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB0048IFUSCKettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato , 2Ounce Pack of 24a and the Jalapeno flavor
1	They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I 'm fine with since I 've a vegetarian
1	I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I ca n't guarantee how many I will have left
1	My fiance and I love these
1	I love Kettle Brand Chipsbr I 've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavorsbr br Sea Salt   Vinegar Chips are TANGY , SOUR , and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time
1	br br Personally , the flavor is too much for me , but my mom   aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips
1	I absolutely love them
1	I like to buy these smaller bags because I ca nt trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good
1	I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change
1	I love these chips , I buy the 24 pack once a month
1	I could still do with more vinegar flavor , but I think this is as close as I 'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myselfbr br I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful
1	Additionally , as other reviewers have said , they have quite a good bit of potassium in them somewhere in the neighbor of 15 RDA per serving
1	I have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a yearI love them , but my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favoriteWill be ordering them
1	These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant
1	I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart no way
1	Honey Dijon flavor okay flavor , but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste
1	I 'm not a fancy cheese eater , and it lingers for at least an hour
1	I 'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5br br We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor 4 stars , which we both liked better , and they did n't leave any longlingering or bad aftertastebr br I 'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars
1	The chips are crunchy , but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips
1	For me , Kettle is the best brand on the market
1	I did n't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips , but these are my new favorite
1	I hope they come out with a low fat version their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors
1	These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly
1	What I like about thembr 1 Very thick chipsbr 2 No trans fat and all natural , according to the info on the bagbr 3 Flavor , but that 's a subjective thingbr 4 2 oz bags , which keep you from eating too much at one time
1	What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them
1	I usually love Kettle Chips , and love salt   vinegar , but these chips were way too vinegary for me
1	They do have the typical kettle chip crunch , but are too aggressively flavored for my taste
1	I have always been a fan of Kettle chips
1	When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality
1	These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the packagebr br The New York Cheddar chips have a very subtle flavor to them
1	You can taste the cheddar in them but it does n't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might
1	The taste lingers as well which is a definite plusbr br Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp , that crunch in your mouth
1	The flavor is great and you wo nt ' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover
1	These used to be my favorite flavor until I tried their Salt and Pepper kind but I 'm sure this is just a personal preferencebr br Crunchy , real potato chips
1	I subscribed to these   one case every three months
1	That comes out to about 5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want
1	Because it seems FritoLay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items FritoLay wants me to have
1	The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway for example which I find works very well   they 're large enough to be a good snack on their own , or you can even share a single bag over lunch
1	I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption
1	I took the plunge as I do like salty , and tangy flavors
1	No , I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price
1	They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date FEB 2011
1	Umm , I 'm in the middle on these chips , they are OK but not something I ca n't live without
1	They are a little too vinegary for my taste , which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hardboiled eggs and pickled pigs feetbr br I have n't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience
1	My husband and I LOVE these chips
1	I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store , Lunds , but they were on sale , so I bought a bag
1	Tried the Thai or asianinspired chips by Target , Archer Farms , and they were awful
1	These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesomeso much so , that I 'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon
1	As a professional potato chip muncher , I see these as thee very BEST on the market
1	These are handsdown the absolute best Salt   Vinegar chips you can buy
1	They have a great , strong flavor that has left me addicted
1	I highly recommend trying them
1	And they 're so hard to find where I am , and when I do find them , they 're usually 12 more per bag for less
1	When I buy a larger bag it 's harder to resist eating them all
1	In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips , from the best I 've ever had to big disappointments
1	If you have eaten the LantChips varieties , there is no way that they are not the best as a group the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products
1	If wou are strong at will , or having a large BBQ go for it , but as for me , i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days , had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it
1	They have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time I end up tearing down the entire side of the bag
1	We bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in Sonoma while we were on vacation
1	I was n't sure what to expect by the package , and at first bite I did n't know what to thinkand then all of the flavors hitbr Yum
1	They are n't sold everywhere though , I 'm still trying to find them somewhere close to where I live
1	I have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive
1	I ca n't stop eating them
1	Believe me , some chips are so salty , I ca n't finish a small bag
1	They sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands
1	These will be the only chips that I buy from now on and I thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time
1	I 'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors , so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt   Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber , carrot , celery and cherry tomatoes
1	Skip the dip balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetablebr br As an Oregonian , I 'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends , especially those living outside our state and who have n't experienced gourmet chips
1	I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beerbr br Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakablea light gold color , rich flavor and amazing crunch
1	The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosherbr br I also recommend a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB000G6MBV4Kettle Chips Honey Dijona and a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB000G6Q4GMKettle Chips Spicy Thaiabr br Annette Solomon , a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips
1	Solomon wrote , you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing
1	Other brands I 've tried use too much mustard flavor , which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairingbr br These chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans , coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat
1	Naturally , they also go down great with beerbr br As an Oregonian , I 'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends , especially those living outside our state and who have n't experienced gourmet chips

1	Solomon wrote , you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing
1	These chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school
1	They are by far the tastiest chips I 've had and it 's impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag
1	These are by far my favorite chips , they are extremely crunchy similar to other Kettle style chips , but it 's the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks
1	I 've tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close
1	They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut
1	I much prefer the salt   pepper just for the krinkle cut   they have a better texture
1	All around this brand is much better than FritoLay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping
1	These are similar to Tim 's or Zack 's chips in that they are very crispybr br On a side note , these are the hardest bags to open by hand
1	It took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you
1	They sure were eaten all up by my family and friends
1	The best thing was that there were a lot of brown chips in the bsg my favorite , so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends
1	I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty , and the onion flavor is better
1	If you have n't eaten Kettle chips before , I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk
1	We are always pleased with Amazon 's packaging
1	I love them
1	My children and their friends love them
1	Even my 4 year old loves them
1	They are hard to find in Vegas and are my favorite flavor
1	fantasticyou can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover
1	Once I would open a bag I could not stop
1	I do n't eat many chips , but these I love
1	Expiration date is a ways away , so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor
1	I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends
1	But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind
1	Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I do n't have to buy them from the store anymore
1	I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked
1	I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly
1	For some reason Amazon would not ship these to Alaskaso I sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them
1	They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy
1	They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture
1	I really love Kettle brand chips , but these are rather disappointing
1	I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste , a bit oily and overcooked
1	It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB000G6Q4GMKettle Chips Spicy Thai , 2Ounce Bags Pack of 24a
1	It is obvious the chips are flavored , but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor
1	And I love New York Cheddar
1	A good chip even when overcooked , but I do not plan to buy them again
1	I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring
1	Then all of a sudden , within seconds , it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy
1	We love Kettle Chips Lightly Salted and do n't feel guilty eating them
1	We used to buy them at Whole Foods but buying from Amazon has saved us money
1	A friend of mine brought these into work with the claim , these will change your life
1	While my life is fairly unchanged , I can not get enough of these chips
1	try these anyway , they may convert you
1	But if you happen to , like me , there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip I 've found in this country
1	I do n't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I 've ever had , but they do
1	They 're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c , which could be because they do n't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normalbr br And if you like these , all of the Kettle chips are great
1	i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them
1	i recommend them
1	How can you go wrongbr br Obviously , not for you if you do n't like spicy food
1	But , if you DO like spicy food , you 'll probably love these
1	Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet , savory and spicy everything you 'd want in a good meal or better yeta potato chip
1	They are , however , sliced just perfectly , not too thick , not too thin , so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off
1	If you like any spice at all , these really are not overly spicy , so most people can handle them
1	Okay , I should not eat potato chips , nor should anyonebr But these are so spicy , I would find it hard to eatbr very many
1	I do n't write very many reviews but I have to say that Kettle Brand chips are the best I have ever tasted
1	If you are feeling iffy about honey dijon , I would recommend cheddar beer , absolutely amazing
1	besides a lil fat I have eaten a lot of chips in my day and Kettle takes the cake
1	I bought these for the office and no one can put them down
1	I 'm ordering more today and it has only been 2 weeks
1	Did n't have to shop for them either , Amazon brought it to my door
1	It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me
1	They are my favorite because I can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt
1	Amazon 's suggestion for a 4 star review is I like it
1	That being said , I gave a 5 star review to the Spicy Thai chips
1	We like the ones that have Sea Salt
1	We also like Barbeque flavored
1	They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth
1	The sea salt ones , which are a favorite , have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chipsbr br Enjoy
1	They came when you said they would
1	Odds are that you will have them to yourself
1	If you like your fish and chips soaked in malt vinegar , you will love these
1	The best salt and vinegar chips I have ever had and I love this flavor , mind you
1	Since I have found that SV is palatable to only the most intelligent of our species I know that my afternoon snack is all mine , unless of course I run into another heavy brained , hearty breathed like mind
1	Summary If you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wo nt pucker at the sight of these handily bagged morsels
1	It is the first and only time I have committed to a whole case of chips and I will do it again
1	I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED
1	I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain
1	They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you can not taste any of thatit 's annoying
1	I do not recommend this flavorsalt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite
1	These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouthbr br For my entire life Sour Cream   Onion and in this case   Chive chips were my favorite
1	So when I found out they had sour cream   onion I just had to try thembr br As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk
1	I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery , chalky texture on a chip , with a rancid and onion flavor and I have a hard time believing that person existsbr br I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them
1	Everyone I 've let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste
1	I 've yet to find a Kettle chip that disappointed
1	I love these chips , which is why I bought them , to stock up for the entire school year
1	This is the first time I tried Sea Salt   Vinegar chips
1	You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before
1	so run like you stole something over to your computer and order the SPICY THAI CHIPS
1	even if you paid the going price of 3000 , you are still ahead of the curve
1	I keep sayingbr br You ca n't go wrong with these if you 're a fan of the salt and vinegar classic flavorbr br 2ounce bags are about double the size of the kid 's bags about the same size as the ones in the small gas station racks
1	These were nasty , they were so greasy and too rich for my blood , plus they lacked major flavor , no spicy jalapeno flavor at all
1	I was so dissapointed in these chips , I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you , yuck yuck yuck
1	I wish I could give these zero stars if I could
1	If you like spicy , then these are for you
1	I like spicy , so I enjoyed these
1	These are decent , but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip , try Boulder 's Salt and Malt Vinegar chips
1	Each chip has the perfect thickness   my teeth get excited every time I put one in my mouth
1	Everything about these chips is so perfect , it 's like they were made by God and delivered by Gabriel himself
1	Now that I know Amazon carries these , I do n't even have to leave my house to buy them
1	If you like a lot of flavor , you 'll love these
1	I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe 's with my daughter Mindy
1	I could n't believe how tasty they were the best chip I had ever eaten
1	It was love at first bite , and I 've been munching them ever sincebr br Other things in their favor they 're thicker than other chips , so do n't crumble as I 'm devouring them they 're delightfully crunchy and the saltandvinegar combination is heavenly
1	Is n't that poeticbr br As for health values , since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation , I 'm getting more nutrition , such as potassium and vitamin C My mother would approve of that , and the fact that they 're handcooked in small batchesbr br I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea , but they 're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch
1	Well , actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything   except sweets , of coursebr br My only problem is that they 're so delicious I ca n't stop eating them
1	That 's the reason I chose these smaller packets I figured 24 could last me almost a month , if I was a good girl , kept my appetite under controland hid them from the kids
1	It is n't easy , but br br Have I told you how much I love thembr br Reviewed by Betty Dravis , 2008br Millennium Babe The Prophecy
1	OK , so they 're still a snack food , but no salt and no transfats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get
1	And if you 're on a lowsalt diet like I am , having these available means I can eat chips , and Kettle are just the best
1	These potato chips are excellentThere are no trans fatsbr br They taste absolutely deliciousWhenever I am in the mood for potatoe chips , Kettles is the brand I buybr br A great product that anyone should enjoy and I highly recommend thembr br Enjoy
1	It feels strange to review chips , but I am compelled because these are my absolute favorite chips
1	Kettle has lots of flavors but I always go back to these regular lightly saltedbr br They are thicker and sometimes greasy at the bottom of the bag , plus they often looked burned
1	I love to open a bag and find some browned chipsbr br Lays and Wise have their place but I 've become a chip snob thanks to Kettlebr br Like Edy 's or Breyer 's ice cream , some products are worth the money
1	If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth dentures you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand
1	I am dissapointed with all other Salt   Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft andor the vinegar taste whimpy andor chemically
1	I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy
1	I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan
1	About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket
1	I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it
1	After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to
1	They were all uniform whitish yellow in color , flavor was way off , the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed
1	So I emailed Kettle with the following What Happened
1	I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste It tastes cheaper
1	I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor
1	I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering
1	I did receive a reply Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand ® Chips
1	It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections , and we apologizeOur potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in colorbut our chips should still taste greatThanks for providing us with the best before code from the bag
1	This really helps when passing on your comments to our staffbr We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand ® flavors or nut butters , believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase
1	In case you buy this product again , we suggest avoiding the same best before date if you still have it in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same timebr Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks
1	Please let me know if I can be of any more help
1	Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the bad bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost
1	I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company
1	Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same
1	Someone brought these to a party we had last month and I did n't put them out because the buffet was full and did n't think anyone would like saltless potato chips
1	Last week we had some friends over and these were all I had in the pantry so I put them out
1	OH MY GOSH THEY ARE SO GOOD
1	I was so wrong to think they would be bland they are full of real potato flavor , wonderfully crisp and very fresh tasting
1	I am here on amazon to buy a case , I only want to have these with dips
1	Some Kettle Chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch
1	They arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from Amazon Grocery have been
1	I have tried Herrs , UTZ , wise , pringles , lays etcbut Kettle tasted the best
1	The quantity of salt used is the optimum which is requiredbr br Although they say serving size 1 ounce , you will finish the whole packet in no time
1	The first time I tried these , I thought , WOW
1	but I quickly found they were just too darn spicy and tart Hard to enjoy the potatochippiness of them when your mouth is under seige
1	I was eating some out of the bag , when I looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed
1	Then I started looking at all the unopened bags and MANY of them had this type same hole
1	The box they shipped in had NO holes so they we 're packed this way
1	Needless to say I 'll never be eating anymore Kettle products and expect a full refund from Kettle or Amazonbr M
1	Chilling in the fridge seems to boost the flavor even more and using them , rather than corn chips , to make nachos will have your tastebuds singing like Janet Jackson
1	When originally produced in England these we 're the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty
1	after opening numerous bags I found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them
1	I was getting VERY worried , when I read some of the other reviews here
1	Specifically , the One Star reviews , to which I always go , to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying itbr br WOW
1	They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS , BACKYARD BARBECUE 9OUNCE BAGS , PACK OF 12 , that I had bought as 1 ounce bags , liked A LOT , decided to subscribeand then , for good measure , got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bagsbr br YesI love potato chipsespecially these KETTLE CHIPS , BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOURbut others seemed to really HATE themor at least , hate how they had changedbr But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS
1	Also , as we 're all potatochip lovers , but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing , we are , here a sort of United Nations of Potato Chip Loversall different , but all united in our love of Potato Chips
1	The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightlyknit , but everer , expandinggroup here , I think
1	   But   not at first realizing that thesebr different flavour reviews were all together , did cause me a little confusion and dismay at least to begin with Amazon should have mentioned that this is the Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum
1	  br br I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS , BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR , are totally delicious
1	They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever hadthat was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even mebr These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle , however , have just the right amount of sweetness , with honey powder , onion and sugar , to take the edge of the stonger flavoursbr paprika , chili pepper , cayenne pepper , and natural smoke flavour , of which there is less , they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners
1	But as far as the potassium , energy   good , too much   bad for the kidneys , and the sugar and natural smoke flavour , too much leading to cancer production   the only thing is to do what is good in everythingM O D E R A T I O Nbr br Twice or three times a month , I allow myself to go on what I call a Potato Chip Diet
1	I eat only one large bag , or the equivalent in small ones , of potato chips all day
1	I supplement this with tea , coffee , and lemonade , as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials , I like the Dark Chocolate flavour This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat , if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks
1	It also teaches me to eat slowly , because that one big bag , or many little bags , never lasts as long as I 'd like
1	Anyway , with excercise and sensible eating , the rest of the month , and keeping my scale nearby , and weighing myself at least twice a day , every day , I 've taken off ten pounds in the last three months
1	Except for those jalapino chips , which tasted good , but were far too spicy for my own taste buds , I have yet to meet a potato chip I did n't like to eat
1	These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips , with their combination of potatoes , sweetness , and spices , have truly become one of my top five favouritesif not the VERY first favourite , of allbr br Flavoured potato PERFECTION
1	They 're not necessarily bad but they 're the kind of chip where you 're only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty
1	I 've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning
1	Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazoncom and this was one
1	I could n't stop eating them
1	They did n't last very longbr br The reason I gave them 4 stars , instead of 5 , is because I think the bags are a little hard to open
1	I 'm not sure why they need to make a potato chip bag that sturdy , you may need some scissors on hand to open them much easier
1	They are as good as the Kettle Brand once was
1	I 'll NEVER buy anything from Kettle brand ever again
1	Unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual pinches of salt and drinking actual vinegar , i doubt you will like these chips
1	These are the saltiest   sourest chips I have ever had , and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because I paid for 2 full boxes and do nt like to waste food
1	Unless you are the rare kind that can take this kind of extreme taste , you will not like these chipsbr br I actually have a high tolerance for sour taste , so I can down a bag of chips with a bit of difficulty
1	I bought this brand as a trial since I am tired of the Pingosbr br It claims that it is natural
1	So I just throw away all of them
1	I do n't know if I was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same
1	They are good but wish they were also baked
1	I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORSbr SALT   FRESH GROUND PEPPERbr TUSCAN 3 CHEESEbr NY
1	CHEDDAR AND HERSbr br THEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME
1	IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZEbr br I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS
1	I purchased these because of the low salt , and they were indeed low in salt
1	I will never buy these again , and I would not recommend them to others
1	If you are looking for STRONG SV flavor these definitely are n't for you
1	I live in TX and I can tell you I 've tried ALL SV chips I can get ahold of
1	From a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch , but if you 're looking for SV flavor these have just a touch
1	I do n't know if it was the case of chips we received or what , but everyone we allowed to sample the chips in a buffet style setting agreed that these were slightly on the salty sidebr One person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow , due to the amount of salt in thesebr br We had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the Lay 's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips , but these Kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact oppositebr br Sorry folks , we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty sidebr br We are still looking forward to Amazon finally getting the Lay 's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips in stockbr These got a 2 star , because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique
1	Even if they are trans fat free , they need to be a lot less greasy
1	Do n't waste your money on any of the Kettle brand potato chips
1	DEfintely not as tasty as the Madhouse Munchies which are my family 's favorite
1	I love sour food but this one I ca n't bear
1	I have loved Kettle Brand Sea Salt and Vinegar chips since the first time i tried them
1	The fact that i was able to find them online for such a great price , was wonderful
1	THey are a quick and simple snack for lunch and it goes great with my cold sandwich
1	MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free
1	Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them
1	They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they didbr br The worst part though is that they taste horrible
1	Instead of crisp , oily and full of charactersay as if they were cooked in likea kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays
1	Other reviewers who bought around the same time that I did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chipsbr br The chips came in a sealed Kettle box , so it 's hard to say who screwed up
1	After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5 oz bags to arrive , upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse
1	When my son gets home , I 'm going to have pictures taken and email to Amazon
1	I will never buy these again from Amazon
1	I can not tell you how disgusted I am with this purchase
1	It makes me sick to think about itbr br I included pictures at the top of the page
1	Poor little mousie must have high cholesterol nowbr br Update I forgot to mention that I offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to Amazon but was told they did n't want them
1	I give the Lord thanks every day for delivering unto me such an incredulously delicious blend of ginger and spice , a veritable cornucopia of flavor
1	I have actually changed my diet to a strict regiment of the Spicy Thai   Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors , alternating days
1	I have already lost 5 lbs , not to mention the myriad of other health benefits I have been experiencing
1	She calls them her sour chips and wants them in her lunch all the time
1	I love the crispy kettle way they 're cooked
1	I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together
1	Also , they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming careful
1	I can not believe this , I received this item and EVERY SINGLE BAG WAS OPENED BUT 4
1	I 'm stationed in Afghanistan and this was gon na be a snack for my team while going out on missions
1	After reading some of the reviews , I got nervous and opened a bag from my recent order expecting the worst
1	Kettle Branch Potato Chips New York Cheddar These are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty , on the burnt side , and taste rancid , either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old
1	I am glad I was able to find these on this site
1	I love this flavor and they are so crunchy
1	They 'll totally know it was you
1	With that said , they DO make fantastic plain chips
1	You wo n't regret itbr br Some people say they are burnt but they are n't
1	From their website Take a quick look and you 'll see an immediate difference Kettle Brand ® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold
1	But they explain that on their website At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower andor safflower oil to make Kettle Brand ® products
1	We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are trans fat free meaning none were detected
1	You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging
1	For those of us watching our salt intake , the unsalted chips is the best you can get
1	I first came upon them when I visited a CostPlus World Market store in Opelika , AL , in the Tiger Town Mall , in 2007
1	I was n't a big fan of dijonflavored anything , but I decided to give these chips a try
1	I probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months ' time
1	I searched all over my part of Alabama the northwestern part of the state and could not find them
1	I later tried to find them at the World Market in Hoover , at the Patton Creek Shopping Center , and they did not carry this flavor
1	However , when I learned that they were available on Amazoncom , and also available for PRIME Shipping   I bought them as soon as I read Kettle Chips Honey Dijon , 9Ounce Bags Pack of 12
1	They last quite a while , but I will reorder , very , very soon
1	I suggest you buy them , in this bulk form , and enjoy them   you wo n't be disappointed
1	They go great with hamburgers and hot dogs   so they 're perfect for spring and this coming summer 's outdoor activities and cookoutsbr br Take my word for it , these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods
1	Buy some today , and fall in love like me
1	I have never been addicted to anything in my lifeuntil I tasted these chips
1	I have tried other brands of the sea salt and vinegar flavor and they are just not the same
1	I 'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors , so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt   Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber , carrot , celery and cherry tomatoes
1	Skip the dip balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetablebr br As an Oregonian , I 'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends , especially those living outside our state and who have n't experienced gourmet chips
1	I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beerbr br Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakablea light gold color , rich flavor and amazing crunch
1	The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosherbr br I also recommend a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB000G6MBV4Kettle Chips Honey Dijona and a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB000G6Q4GMKettle Chips Spicy Thaiabr br Annette Solomon , a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips
1	Solomon wrote , you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing
1	I bought these when on sale through Amazon
1	Definitely a great buy if you can catch them on sale
1	For those of you who , like me , had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally , you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed
1	I paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he did n't like the spicy thai , but these are fine for himbr br Yuck
1	I 'm not a big one for potato chips , so I am sure I 've come late to discover these
1	I think they are really good
1	They are thicker   more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we 've all come to know
1	I love these chips and now the whole family is hooked on them
1	If you like potato chips you will like these
1	Get em on sale when you can and limit your intakeif you can
1	If you 're looking at this you probably already know you like these chipsbr This is a great deal and I have not had any problems with them going stalebr The 1 oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid overeating
1	While I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive , I really think this one has gone too far
1	Skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these
1	I am surprised that they are still on the market
1	I have found this product , Kettle Chips Unsalted to be fabulous
1	I found them by accident on Amazon after hunting all over my local stores
1	When I saw the Spicy Thai chips , I knew i had to try them
1	I love spicy and I love Thai food , so why not
1	But if you absolutely hate sweet chips , I 'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet
1	Thank you Lord , for I have found another healthy snack food that is unsalted , and tastes great
1	The only thing i would ask Kettle to change is the texture
1	These are my favorite , but they are n't for everybody
1	They are a bit rich , so they are n't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking
1	Salt   vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so I think I 've tried every brand out there
1	I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy
1	You might , actually I 'm sure you probably wo n't like it AT FIRST BITE ' IF ' you have never had these before
1	If you love jalapeno chips then Kettle is a must trybr Nice and cruncy with the kick of jalapenobr Deliciousbr Addictingbr Recommended
1	My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago , and he and I have become addictedbr br First , Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc
1	But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would
1	Still , decent spicynessbr br All in all , I have been pretty happy with this product , in the few weeks since we first bought it
1	I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store
1	I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly
1	There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few casesboxes for just over 1000
1	I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there that way I did n't eat them all
1	As far as the pictures , if the person contacted Amazon , he made out ok Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon
1	If you like plain potato chips , you 'd like these
1	They are thicker than most brands , fresh out of box , very crunchy and not too salty for me
1	Part of the reason is that they are too oily some chips almost look transparent , if you know what I mean
1	If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice , except salt , as the name says
1	I do n't think I 'll buy these again
1	The best by date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October
1	I love this sea salt   vinegar flavor from Kettle
1	When I saw this one on the daily deal here for 1799case , I put my order without doubt
1	However , when I received the case , I found out that the whole case is expiring in December while I got it at the end of August
1	I tried one package and I can definitely taste the unfreshness in the chips
1	I was disappointed and then I found out this item is not returnable
1	Although I love this chips , I wo n't order from here again with the concern of close expiration date
1	This is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them
1	We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags
1	They have 0 fat , no preservatives , nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients
1	It 's simple Buy these chips , get them tomorrow , eat thembr Repeatbr br Whybr br Best old school BBQ flavor out therebr Kettle qualitybr Incredible price with Amazonbr br Did I mention delicious and a terrific bargain
1	I found these more than 10 years ago in a health food store
1	After I bought one bag I found myself stopping by that store once a week to get these chips
1	The New York Cheddar flavor is so good , you will have a hard time not eating a whole bag
1	I gained 5 lbs within a month of buying this 12 pack of full sized bags
1	They should warn you about this
1	When I finish my crash diet I will order another box case
1	They start off sweet , then as you eat more the spice builds up
1	If you do n't want to commit to a whole case , pick up a bag at your local Whole Foods first , then stock up here when you realize how amazing they are
1	On a side note , this brand Kettle Brand has many delicious varieties this is just my personal favorite
1	I also highly recommend Backyard BBQ , Honey Dijon , Sweet Onion , Buffalo Bleu , Salt and Pepper and Death Valley Chipotle
1	I 've eaten other brands of unsalted potato chips and they 've always been terrible
1	I did n't expect much when I bought these
1	But after I tasted them I was amazed
1	Kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips I 've tasted thus far
1	They are thick , has a bite to them and I love their creative flavors
1	My favorite Kettle chip happens to be the honey Dijon
1	I think it 's a great combination sweet , salty and tangy , perfect for one of those snack attacks when you do n't know exactly what you want
1	As an Oregonian , I make a point of sharing these Oregonmade snacks with friends who visit the state

1	Solomon wrote , you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing
1	I 've always liked Salt and Vinegar chips but most of the time the stronger flavor was at the bottom of the bag
1	My only concern is they 're very oily
1	I understand they 're kettle chips and they 're fried small batches and all but when you open the bag That 's another thing , very strong bag
1	They definitely are n't healthy , because I can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them , and I can see the grease at the bottom of the bag , toobr br They are highquality chips , and deserve to be put on your table
1	Kettle Foods , Inc makes the best tasting potato chips I 've ever eaten
1	With a variety of flavors , from classic Barbeque to their unique Spicy Thai you 'll find the right flavor for your mouth
1	And not only do they taste wonderful , but these allnatural chips are cooked in safflower or sunflower oil for zero cholesterolbr br But why is it a GoGreenMartMore product of the week

1	And during recent building construction , they earned a Gold rating from Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEEDbr br Now your mouth will thank you and so will the environment
1	I did n't have to give up totally something that I truely love to snack

1	When you just got ta have some chips , Kettle Chips Lightly Salted chips are the what you 've been searching forbr br There 's no cholesterol , no trans fats , no artificial anything   and because of the manufacturing process , they actually seem to have kind of a homemade qualitybr br This is an excellent product
1	The New York Cheddar flavor is my favorite of all the Kettle Brand potato chips
1	Unfortunately , it may do the opposite to your backside , so do n't do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroombr br I still give it a 5 of 5 starsbr br Also , the online price at Amazon is better than anywhere else I 've seen them
1	Combined with Amazon Prime you 'll be getting a great deal on these chips
1	I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one
1	They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like thesebr br Price wiseI do not see that they are that much of a deal here
1	I purchased them for 299 at the grocery with no shipping
1	I ended up eating a whole bag a day for a while cause they were so good
1	I am glad that they do not have any dextrose in them like lays do
1	if you like honey mustard then you will definitely like this once you eat it you wo nt stopaddicting stuff
1	I do nt know if they were fresh or if they were supposed to taste like they did
1	I checked the expiration date it was current but still tasted kind of stale to me
1	But I love them
1	They are n't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually nonexistentbr br Here are the original and new ingredient listingsbr br Original Ingredientsbr Select Potatoes , Safflower andor Sunflower Oil , Honey Powder Evaporated Cane Syrup , HoneySalt , Garlic Powder , Jalapeno Pepper , Ground ginger , Onion Powder , Habanero Pepper , Dried Parsley , Citric Acid , Cilantro Extract , Ginger Oil , Cayenne Pepper , White Pepper , Lime Oilbr br New Ingredientsbr Potatoes , safflower andor sunflower oil , sugar , dried cane syrup , salt , maltodextrin , yeast extract , spices , garlic powder , onion powder , dried parsley , jalapeno powder , citric acid , natural flavors , lime extractbr br I 'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner , Blue Diamond
1	They might want to get rid of Great Taste Naturally from their bags as I do n't consider maltodextrin to be very naturalbr br Great job Kettle
1	I Was sent 3 week past Fresh by date stock
1	unfortunately I put a chip in my mouth before I saw the holebr br Very bad form amazon
1	I try to be good , but when I feel like indulging in some delicious , gourmet potato chips , these New York Chedder potato chips are the first flavor I like to go for , when I see them at the natural food store
1	I order these by the case of 12   and when they are good , which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip , THE BEST
1	and then I get a case of the worse   the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again , expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best   the last case is what prompted me to write this   the potatos were weird   like they were almost sour as in going bad   and I even wrote the company that makes them   SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try againbr I , myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring
1	I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle
1	I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that
1	Anyways , my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price
1	You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging , also
1	The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I did n't mind but they had tons of flavor
1	These chips do n't have any sour to them at all , and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste
1	If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first
1	They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants
1	We 've long enjoyed this brand of chip , so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find thesebr br   Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I 'm a confirmed saltaholic , generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans
1	The chips are a little greasy , and that 's why I 've given them 4 stars instead of 5
1	Kettle lightly slated chips are my favorite on the market
1	Thick , super crunchy and full of flavor , they are the best
1	They seem as salty as any regular potato chip , and they also seem excessively greasy
1	No trans fat , no cholesterol , no artifical stuffbr Low in sodium and high in potassium , which is great for people like me with HBPbr Only problem is Amazon is out of stock some times and price is high
1	Some people may not like thatbr br I reccomend them
1	My 8 yo is a Kettle chip addict so I was so happy to find snack size bags for his lunch
1	I could n't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing
1	Well , I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key
1	I do n't eat rippleridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth
1	This may sound rediculous , but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettlebrand jalapeno chips
1	At the time I placed my order , I could n't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked , and the Kettlebrand chips were packaged in a similarlycolored bag
1	But , it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettlebrand of jalapeno chips , and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games
1	When I run out probably sometime next year
1	, I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips , and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettlebrand chips
1	Imho , Kettlebrand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip ' affectionados'br br Sincerely , br br   § homiedog §
1	I 'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie 's are better IMHO
1	I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil which are both GMO , and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy , but darnit , these things bite back
1	On the plus side , the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many
1	I vastly prefer Lay 's texture , but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and cornsoy
1	I wish they 'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth , though
1	I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips
1	But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor at the bottom of the bag in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010
1	So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces
1	I knew my family already liked these chips so it was a no brainer to take advantage of a great price for good chips
1	The price per bag ca n't be beat if you order with subscribe and save and the good thing is you can always change the delivery interval if you notice you go through them quicker or slower than you anticipated
1	This is a delicious teabr br I 'm just now becoming a tea geek and really exploring the stuff I like , and Earl Grey is amongst the top , especially with bergamotbr br The problem I find is the amount of bergamot added is usually too little , or too muchbr br This one is perfect
1	I do n't add anything to this tea , just a part of a teaspoon in a cup and in 23 minutes it 's readybr br Tastes like an expensive tea but priced like Lipton
1	I bought this tea as an alternative to very pricey Teavana Black Teas
1	The tea tin is guarding the aroma very wellbr The taste is beautiful the Malva flowers do soften the taste and the amount of bergamot is just rightbr The first time I used too much tea and soaked it for too long I used as reference Darjeeling FTGFOP First Flushbr Since then I save on the quantity of tea leaves and soak the tea for only two minutesbr A delight the best Earl Grey I ever had

1	After a lifetime of tea drinking , I can honestly say that this is the best Earl Grey I have ever tasted
1	Do yourself a favor , if you like Earl Grey , and treat yourself to this tea
1	We love them
1	We would order them again
1	I have a German Shorthair Pointerand these treats are her favorite the organic peanut butter cookies are for smaller dogs , but she loves themand for weightcontrol I like them
1	My male Maltese dog had been enjoying the Old Roy 's Puppy Biscuits from Walmart
1	Then I could n't find them
1	I ordered six bags of the peanut butter and crossed my fingersbr br They arrived , and my little guy loves them
1	When he hears me touch the bag of treats , he beats a path to his crate in high excitement
1	They are a BIG hit with my him
1	They are high quality and I can even smell peanuts in them
1	It has helped make my husband feel lots better even though he is in early renal failure
1	I was depressed I was stuck with 4 bottles of this
1	It sat on my shelf and I forgot about it
1	Last weekend I tasted a Zevia cream soda and was not pleased with the flavor , it tasted weird and smokey like the LorAnn oil I had gotten
1	The odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeelbr br So I wanted to see if this would help the LorAnn oil too
1	Then I added ONE DROP of the oil , it is very strong , and stirred it in   IT TASTED SO MUCH BETTER
1	I whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treatbr br Now I will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream
1	We make up a coffee creamer with 14 part commercial coffee creamer , vanilla , butter creme , almond and Bavarian Creme flavors and the rest milk
1	I 'm from Detroit , and I was raised on Vernor 's ginger ale
1	Once I moved to California , though , I found it difficult to find Vernor 's
1	I guess without advertising , it just never found a homebr br I prefer the plastic bottles , but the ideal size is the 169 oz 500 ml or the one liter
1	The problem with the two liter size is that it takes one person me too long to drink it , letting it go flatbr br In any case , Vernor 's is unique in that it is aged in oak for three years , I think
1	That imparts a great , unique flavorbr br I wish it would catch on again , and become available more widelybr br Recently I did see it on sale in Redwood City in California 's Bay Area , south of San Francisco
1	I like Vernor 's , and drink it all the time
1	They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the costcutting mega soda companies use , rather than the cane sugar they used to use
1	The soda is also known , like other ginger drinks , for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomachbr Vernor 's is a regional soda , and there are many areas of the country you ca n't find it in
1	They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon , at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment
1	Search at Amazon for ASIN B001JK2SEG to see what I mean
1	I use Madhava 's agave nectar in my baked goods all the time , and am always pleased with the results
1	At the time I 'm writing this , Amazon was out of stock as a vendor
1	A little goes a long waybr br Using agave nectar Use 13 to 12 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener depending on your taste and the recipe
1	Most bakers might already know this , but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients unless beaten with butter firstbr br Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do , so you wo n't be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy
1	It makes everything moisterbr br If you are looking for less caramel flavor , you 'll need to use the light version of this product equally good in all applications
1	Very tastybr br However , I was expecting 46 fluid ounces , not 46 ounces in weightbr br I find that 46 ounces in weight makes about 32 fluid ounces
1	First time I 've ever used Agave Nectar   and it is great
1	Now if I could only figure out how to make tequila I would be set
1	The taste is the same , but it seems a little less sweet because I find I have to use more of it to get the right sweetness in my coffee
1	It does n't pour well , so I have to pour it into a better squeeze bottle , so that I do n't have a sticky mess on my counter every day
1	I continue to have it shipped to me every other month
1	It works great for cooking , baking and as a substitute sugar in my Chai lattes
1	I really like this product and taste great with the coffee or tea , and I have lost weight by cutting the sugar and replacing it with the honey and Agave nectar
1	We have been using 17Day Diet guided by LowGlycemic eating for about 67 months , with fair success
1	the one thing I have not tried it on still using sugar is making kombucha   I still use sugar , as I 'm not sure it would be a good idea to introduce a raw element into kombucha
1	But actually , that may just be my own overcaution and nothing related to actual chemistry or circumstancebr br Our primary uses are sweetening yogurt , using it in the little baking I do , and use in salad dressings , fruit desserts , etc
1	Because we are limiting our sweets consumption , we do n't use a lot of this , but it 's nice to have when we need it
1	I plan to try using it in some homemade jams later this season
1	I buy it on subscription , and the cost is about 33 less than the local WalMart and more than 50 less than the health food store on this same brand
1	Best by date on the bottles I received in May is 2015
1	I am so glad I was introduced the this brand of sweetner to replace sugar , this is so much better
1	I really like how it sweetens my herbal sweet teas without having to use too much , and how it can be used in place of pancake syrup too
1	Learning how to use it what the first thing I had to learn , once I learned how to use it , I became hooked
1	I highly reccomend if you want a clean fresh taste and feel to your foodsIf you do purchase this sweetner , take advantage of ship and save , it will save you lots of money in the long run
1	It is the best natural sweetener I have ever tried , and I have tried many
1	You can use also as pancake syrup or as a substitute for honey on your peanut butter and honey sandwich
1	I have been using Agave Nectar for several months now and have found it to be a staple in my home
1	Substitute this to sugar and you 'll be doing your body a great favor
1	I got mine very soon
1	I like the taste of Agave , cross between honeymaple
1	thank you for this product   we use it all the time and appreciate your promptness and the price was excellent
1	I am on a low glycemic index diet to help control my blood sugar and hormone levels
1	My nutritionist recommended agave nectar as a sweetener since it 's GI index is in the low 30 's as opposed to honey in the low 50 's and sugar in the mid50 's
1	It 's used like honey   substitute 23c for every 1c sugar and reduce liquids by 14thbr br I also use it in a carrot cake recipe equal substitution instead of sugar where I substitute whole wheat flour instead of white flour and I do n't decrease the other liquids
1	It 's delicious and you 'd never know that 's it 's actually good for you
1	I am very disappointed with this product because I could not see how many calories it has at the time I ordered it
1	I received it and now I can see it has 60 calories per tablespoon
1	I was out to dinner with friends   family at The Saloon in Rte 46 Entertainment Complex in Sanford FL
1	Besides having an awesome staff ask for Keith and fabulous food the escargot is a MUST they serve China Mist tea
1	This is the 1st time I chose the Tropical Organic Green   I have no doubt it is the best flavored tea I have ever had
1	If you 've tried the conventional Kettle crinkle chip verson Salt and Peper , you CAN'T compare these to those
1	I have become allergic to tomatoes , but I love tortilla chips
1	I prefer to eat them plain
1	They also have just the right amount of heat to make them flovorful , but not overpoweringly spicy
1	I have not had potato chips in approximately two years as it has been difficult to find organic chips
1	Amazon lowered the price on these , and I finally had a chance to order them
1	I most definitely will be ordering them again
1	My family and I love them
1	Try them you 'll like them
1	thesedon't like hot food they might be a bit much for you
1	Of course , Kettle Chips are just good chips   they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty
1	I also like that they are ridged chips   those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me   I do n't want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness
1	If you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips
1	Just the right amount of spice to make them hot and they are also sweet
1	My family and I are offically addicted
1	I think Plocky 's brand as a whole is a cut above in quality but I found these to lack in taste somewhat and be a little greasy
1	Everyone in our family loves them
1	I definitely enjoy the Kettle Sea Salt and Black Pepper
1	I just wish they were bigger bags
1	I ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service
1	If you like barbecue flavor , this is a nice sweetMexified barecuebr br I also like that it 's organicbr br I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes
1	But dang , if they 're not sinfully deliciousbr br Granted , 5 oz is not a whole lot it was skimpy for the price , which is often the case when it comes to organic , but it was 750 calories at a pop
1	At first you think that these chips are n't all that Spicy , but the spice will grow on you with each bite
1	I ca n't say enough good things about Plocky 's chips
1	I have purchased this flavor and the black bean flavor a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB000GWKO7GPlocky 's Tortilla Chips , Black Beans ' N Rice , 7Ounce Bags Pack of 12a and I love them
1	I have never eaten a tortilla chip that did n't make me feel guilty afterwards
1	I actually prefer these eaten by themselvesno dipsand I keep a bag in my desk at work
1	I have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something
1	I bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too
1	I am a fan of Plocky 's chips and will continue to purchase them on Amazon
1	My aunt gave me a bag of these and I was immediately addicted
1	I love the zip , agreed they are awesome without salsa , and no trans fat
1	I was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued Kettle flavor , but was disappointed when I opened the box and found this substitution
1	I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor
1	They can be eaten alone , since they are so crisp and tasty or with a dip
1	Every one that we have introduced the chips to , loves them
1	And the expiration date is for 8 months from now , so ordering 12 bags did n't come near to them going stale
1	I bought these chips , and wanted to try if they were tasty
1	But I liked this very muchbr br I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips
1	Used to get them at Henry 's in San Diego , CA before we moved out of there and have been ordering them from Amazon since
1	Ca n't always get them in local stores , they do n't keep them stocked even though we are always buying them out
1	The first time I ate these was at night and then even after brushing and flossing I could taste them in my mouth the next morning
1	So just be careful about when you eat them , especially if you will be hanging out with people later in the day
1	The first time I ate these chips was in Aruba in 2007
1	I could n't find them in our area CT so you can imagine my joy when I found them on Amazon
1	I love these and hope you continue to carry them
1	I pay 299 in Aruba and they run about 246 a bag when I buy the case of 12 through Amazon
1	Only problem is , now everybody wants them here and they steal my bags when the case comes in , but that 's oksharing is good
1	If you like salt   pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch , then you ca n't go wrong with thesethey are the tastiest bag I 've come across
1	The sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt , in fact I have trouble cutting myself off midbag even though I normally enjoy a low sodium diet
1	I would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 89 oz bags
1	I used to buy these at the local supermarket , but they are no longer carried there
1	Finding them on Amazon I purchased a box and found they were fresh and delicious as I remembered
1	I definately will buy them again
1	I shared a few bags with my daughter in Iraq
1	She said Ummm they are Good
1	They are good for you too
1	We like Plockysbr They like usbr Plockys Plockysbr Mean no fussbr Taste so goodbr And healthy toobr Plockys Plockysbr Grab a bag or twobr Thank you Plockys
1	I Love these potato chip they r soooo good
1	The best potato chips I 've ever had at the best price I 've ever paid
1	They are with out a doubt the best chips that I have ever had
1	They are the best chips I 've ever had
1	We ordered these only because the Black Beans and Rice , which we really
1	After about a week , we finally opened up a package and then kicked ourselves for not having tried them earlier
1	There is a little kick to them after you swallow them to let you know you have had a hint of hot pepper of some sort
1	We took them to a pot luck that night and came home with an empty bag
1	I used them , from another bag , as a garnish on a salad that I took to the pot luck and we came home with an empty salad bowlbr We will definitely order these againa hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB000GWLUGUPlocky 's Tortilla Chips , Red Beans ' N Rice , 7Ounce Bags Pack of 12a
1	I was first introduced to the Red Rice   Beans chips in my hometown of Bethlehem , PA
1	When I moved to North Carolina I was unable to find these chips in my local area
1	On my trips back home , I would buy a bunch of bags to bring back with me to NC
1	Then I discovered that I could order them online and life was great
1	These chips are my all time favorite and everyone that I serve them to loves them just the same
1	You just got ta try them   you 'll be hooked
1	If you do n't want to get addicted , do n't try Plocky 's Red Beans and Rice Tortilla Chips
1	My husband and I started with one seemingly anodyne bag from a store
1	Now , we 've just received our second case
1	My husband who , being Mexican , is very picky about his tortilla chips and I absolutely love these
1	He actually usually prefers a very hearty , cruncy chip Like El Ranchero , but the flavor of these is so fantastic that we 're both thilled with them
1	The bean , rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful , and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that
1	We go through an embarrassing amount of them
1	I never , ever like plain chips , but these I can eat without anything else , although they 're particularly amazing with a fresh salsa
1	a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB000GWLUGUPlocky 's Tortilla Chips , Red Beans ' N Rice , 7 Ounce Bag Pack of 12a I first tasted these chips while visiting relatives in KY
1	They are not available where I live , so I ordered them from Amazon
1	My friends and family are all addicted to them
1	They are even great by themselves
1	We will order these as long as they are available
1	Thank you for making them accessablebr br   Shelly Kenyon
1	I 'm a huge Tabasco fan , and I love unconventional snacks
1	But these do n't taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they 're made from I did n't find them to have much of a kick at all
1	Even with my strong aversion to wasting food , I had to throw out or give away most of the case
1	Kettle still advertises their products as containing No MSG while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities
1	You 'll be glad you did as they disappear fast
1	I love these chips and ordered them after I had some in Florida
1	Needless to say most of the chips were broken and I would not order them again
1	I received this chips in a gift basket and absolutely loved them
1	I searched high and low , but was unable to find them until I saw them here
1	I love them with dip , in chili , or just plain
1	Once you try them , you 'll be hooked
1	They 're light , crisp , great tasting , nice texture , AND they 're all natural AND low in fat and sodium
1	I recently bought a bag of them at a regular grocery store , and could n't belive my taste buds
1	That 's why I excited why I saw them here on Amazon , and decided to buy a case
1	They 're made with lots of whole grain and beans , and make a complete protein , so I have no qualms about feeding them to my kids as snacks
1	The only problem I have with them The bag is too small
1	They did a very good job with shipping the order quicklyNothing like Ace Hardware who took a week to ship
1	We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand , this is my favoritebr br BUT as noted by another reviewer   these contain MSG in the form of Yeast Extractbr br It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things , as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersomebr br Also , the bag is not very large , but half of it is air
1	I bought thi9s for my dad for a surprise birthday present because he could not find them any where else
1	So surprised to find the Taiwanshaped pineapple cakes , they are so cutebr I 've never found any pineapple cake like this at our local Asian supermarkets , so I ordered some from here
1	My friends and I think it is a good idea to order them again for our MidAutumn Festival party
1	You can even taste the fibers from pineapplebr br I opted for the traditional pineapple this time
1	I will be interested in trying out the Longan or mango variety next time
1	I purchased this 24 pack of Big Ass soda and only got 23
1	I highly recommend along with other soda , Voltagesbr br Malcom
1	Well being the big red fan that I am , I bought some of this
1	First of all let me tell you the price is amazing , I mean where else can you get this type of deal in Saudi Arabia
1	edible , not real enjoyable for the price I paid , One of the best pretzel 's I had whenbr i purchased them from Publix
1	They stopped carrying them , I must find another addiction
1	It 's moist and tender and a great little sweet treat when you want something that is n't terribly bad for your diet
1	Unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously , I neglected to not look for the word supreme in this offer and since I was then receiving free shipping had 4 delivered
1	We that is my husband , guests and meknew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed
1	BUT , currently Amazon featured the supreme babka and now I am awaiting to receive these
1	I opened the can and immediately became concerned when I saw what looked like dried white crust , rather than fluffy frosting
1	The best I can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in Better of Dead no raisins in it though
1	When lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knifebr I opted for making my own frosting instead   very easy
1	A little Sprectrum palm shortening , a lot of powdered sugar , a tiny splash of vanilla , a tiny bit of salt , and rice milk as needed for consistency , beat for 5 minutes , and I had the fluffy ' butter ' cream frosting I thought I 'd get from Cherrybrookbr br I wonder if our can was overheated in the store whole foods or somethingbr I 've read positive reviews of their frosting mix , so maybe I 'll try that next time
1	I 'm so mad at myself for wasting my money , and not trying to make it from scratch at home
1	I love Cherrybrook Kitchen and have tried almost all of their products
1	I was excited to try the Ready to Spread frosting , as I do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting
1	Save yourself the time and   I paid 499 and make your own frosting or go with another brand
1	I am glad I found this on the reduced rack for 99c
1	The taste was not bad but no way I could frost my cake
1	I too thought I had gotten a bad batchMy GDs birthday cake looks like crap
1	I recently purchased this on sale at my local grocery store now I know why it was on salebr br This is not a fluffy , creamy white frosting you 'd expect to find when opening the jar
1	Now , I was n't expecting it to be just like Betty Crocker , but it was pretty bad
1	I can honestly say this is the worst frosting we have ever bought
1	And since we were in a time crunch , we did n't have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting , so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it
1	By the time we were done decorating , we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family
1	I work in college Financial Aid and keep a bowl of these on my desk for the students
1	I used to buy them in the grocery store then learned I could get them for less online 17 for 3 lb bag and thought that was a good deal   until I found this GREAT deal
1	The sausage I used in dirty rice , the hamburger I used for taco salad , the chicken with wild rice , and the pork with stuffing
1	the turkey I gave to a neighbor because I do n't eat it
1	There is a mild spamlike texture and taste to the meatsbut way better than spam any day , almost a brine or something , that 's why I heavily seasoned it

1	My personal use is to add this to kombucha , maximizing it 's longevity that way , I 've tried many but this one is the best for kombucha
1	They say an 8 oz glass has 2 servings of fruit on the Lakewood website
1	Considering the price of Goji berries I really like their inclusion in this drink , albeit at a lesser levelbr br BTW Amazon had only 1 day wait before shipping
1	For that exotic unique acai experience try Zola or Samzon brandsbr br I 'm not saying that this Lakewood juice product is n't nutritious
1	To add that wonderful rich smooth cheese flavor that accompanies mac and cheese , you will have to add your own organic cheesebr br The cheese packet falls flat on flavor and it does not contain a sufficient amount to coat the pasta
1	If this flavor lasted longer than it does , I 'd probably die of starvation for lack of wanting to take it out of my mouth
1	My husband and I were very disappointed in this coffee , very weak , watery cup of coffee
1	For me , the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman 's full middle flavor is a plus
1	I prefere Kikoman , especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct
1	But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor
1	I have n't tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor , which is how soy sauce is usually usedbr   Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce
1	If you want a unique Kentucky gift for an Asian friend , this is different than the standard bottle of Bourbon or box of chocolate
1	I watched an episode o How Things are Made on Discovery Channell and saw Bluegrass Soy Sauce featured
1	My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised and liked it very much
1	In the past , I made many trips to the Far East and developed a real liking for Soy Sauce where virtually all of it is made
1	My bottle arrived just in time for a sushi dinner and game night planned with friends
1	I 'm going back to order more right now , and I 'll be ordering 3 extra bottles because they are going to make a great little gift that 's affordable and unique instead of the traditional bottle of wine that so common it 's boring
1	If you enjoy the flavor of soy you will really like thisbr br Plus its hand made in the good ole USA
1	Thanks to Amazon , we were able to find it again
1	Saw this on How it is made , which was a very interesting processbr Decided to give it a try , I really enjoy the flavor it addsbr Looking forward to trying it on several more dishesbr Thanks to those who brewed it
1	most soy sauce is from Japan but they are having problems with radiation in their soy bean fields
1	yea You pay more but decided not to take a chance on Japan
1	I 'm pleased with these was n't sure how they 'd be able to replicate the autumn classic flavors of caramel apples , but figured Werther 's was a good bet
1	I 'm diabetic , so wolfing down a real caramel apple when the mood strikes just ca n't happen as often as I 'd like to do so
1	But these are tasty enough to get me through until I can ' carb budget ' the real thing
1	These are made with sugar alcohols , so it 's wise to limit how many are eaten in a day unless you 're going to be near home and have turboflush on your toilet
1	This item , WERTHER 'S SUGAR FREE HARD CANDY , if consumed , will give you   or your friends , loose bowels
1	I purchased 12 bags and discovered more than a bowel problem You ca n't return them
1	I have ten unopened bags you can have   for free
1	I usually brew   drink Organic Sumatra Mandeling from BJ 's
1	I use this blend exclusively , so to get a cup that rivals the complex flavor from my Tassimo brewer is fantastic
1	We 've tried many Tassimo flavors
1	Our normal cup of coffee is Starbuck 's house blend out of a Cuisinart pot but one or two days a week we use our Tassimo
1	I do n't understand the current price over 20 for 14 disks and hope that it will be lowered on Amazon
1	I also adore Amazon , but they need to negotiate a better price for their Tassimo Disks
1	and I always get 20 off which brings it down to 800   they were 750 before the 20 off readily available coupons until about 3 months ago
1	Again , this is an excellent blend with full flavor   not bitter   I think it 's my favorite
1	I have tried about 75 of the available TDiscs , and the Kona Blend is one of the best regularunflavored coffees for Tassimo
1	I will buy it again because it 's a nice , mellow blend , and my favorite daily coffee , Nabob , must now be shipped from Canada
1	However , on my first order to the Canadian company , it 's taking a long time to be delivered still have n't gotten itbr br The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this Kona coffee is actually only 15 Kona
1	If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc , you can see that information , and there 's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description
1	So it 's my fault for not reading more carefully , but I was happy to see what I thought was 100 Kona and was n't careful
1	I 've bought the 15 Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs , but I just read the product title and orderedbr br As I said , the coffee tastes good , the amount of coffee is the usual amount , neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size , and I would recommend the coffee
1	Of all the coffee 's available for Tassimo this Kona has the richest flavor and fantastic aroma bybr far my favorite
1	I think these are my favorite cookies ever
1	Too bad you can no longer find them anywhere for less than twohundred count
1	I do n't think I need THAT many
1	It is a smoother , creamier basic chocolatebr br I fully recommend the Milka Naps Mix Gift Boxbr br Anthony Trendlbr editor , HungarianBookstorecom
1	I ordered for my dad for fathers day and he ate the whole box within two daysbr He said it tasted really good , now I want to order some for myself , haha
1	It was smaller than I imagined it and I thought it was expensive for how small it was
1	However , I am in Germany and can get it easier here
1	Great product and fun for our USA family to receive
1	I eat mustard with everything , this is hands down THE BESt mustard I have ever tried , in fact everyone I tell to try some , falls in love with it as well
1	Spicy , tasty , real qualitybr If you like spicy mustard , you will love this
1	The laddoos turned bad in a few days after we received it
1	I would buy again once I need more
1	Our ferret loves this rabbit it 's a nice high protein treat in addition to his regular Evo ferret diet
1	He did n't have the patience to be precise about the water temperature and when , half an hour before it was done , it appeared not to have risen at allI feared for the worse
1	Fortunately we had lots of deli meats , since the whole loaf disappeared within the hourbr br We 've had all but the sourdough peasant bread so far I 'm sure that will be delicious as well
1	Used them for a beethemed party , and now we use them as to go packs of honey for our coffee and tea
1	I was very happy with the quick shipping as i needed it for a school product for my daughter but when it came in the roof was broken and the corner of the house was broken

1	My son is a SB fanatic so I was so excited to find this for the 2010 holiday season as every year we do some version of gingerbread
1	I knew by reading reviews that there would n't be enough yellow frosting so I whipped up so edible glue water and confectionery sugar to hold the levels of gingerbread that make the pineapple and save the yellow frosting for the outside   this worked great
1	My 5 year old did like making it though
1	I am a preschool teacher and do a G is for Gingerbread unit every January
1	I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found
1	I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week
1	So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday
1	I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme
1	I called Amazon , they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them
1	I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come broken
1	I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100 's of orders
1	I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed
1	I was pleasantly surprised to find this item had been delivered the day after my order , my speediest delivery to date
1	These cookies were fun to paint but not too tasty to eatbr The kids did not really care much , but it might have beenbr more fun if they could have eaten thembr br They really had fun coloring them
1	I was disappointed in this product because I thought it would be biggerbr Also , it did not come with enough icing
1	I had to use my own
1	I think it would be fun to make and a cute decoration , but my son is going to want to eat it
1	It invigorates like a puncture wound , and the only revival is that , after drinking , you discover that you are still alivebr br Well , one tea bag was enough for me
1	If she likes it , she can have the whole box
1	I am a huge fan of Twinings teas , and was very excited to try this new blend
1	I thought one of my ingredients must be rancid
1	I hunted around for almost four minutes before I realized it was the tea
1	i have it every morning
1	I love the aroma and the taste of the fruit and vanilla combo , and the addition of ginseng for an added energy boost rounds this tea out nicely for me
1	Their actual stores are rare , but Kroger , WalMart , Martin 's formerly Ukrops and a long list of other grocery stores and many malls stock their productsbr br I have never encountered milk chocolates with caramel filling to surpass the quality of these
1	You can eat them quickly , or take your time and savor every moment of eating every one
1	They did n't believe they deserved receiving these , but I know they did deserve to receive these
1	Do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight   you will end up an addict like mebr   The Ghiradelli product is far better than the CaramelloHershey product in every way
1	Of course , we all know how delicious Ghirardelli chocolate is
1	Unfortunately , after I purchased two of these gift bags online , I found them in a local store for half the price
1	I gave it to my girlfriend as a surprise gift and she absolutely loved it
1	the first time i ordered this it came all melted but amazon was quick to remedy the situation by sending me another of the product and it was great thank you
1	These soups are a nice fill in when you do n't want too much but do n't want to be hungry for a few hours
1	Had I known that I would not have purchased the set
1	I really was looking forward to using the cute looking mug on a daily basis
1	These small chocolate cups are a specialty party item that I have never been able to find in the past when I wanted them
1	Adds a touch of class to your event and elevates you to host supreme
1	I could not find these in any local store , so was happy to find them onlinebr Most people are unaware of them , so they are impressed when I serve them a little cordial or other liquor in a chocolate cup
1	Besides that mentioned in the title , the only other remarks I have about it is the price is hard to beat , the taste is akin to a Flintstone strawberry vitamin for those of you that have tasted them , and taste lasts for not very long
1	I love this flavor and I ca nt find it on the shelves anymore
1	If some other yahoo deems it ok to give give a suck review to this stuff because he does n't like the taste , I feel I must assert that in this as in all matters of taste De Gustibus Non Disputandem Estbr br I really love this gum
1	It has a wonderfully smooth consistency about halfway through , but then it gets tired , stuff , and squeakybr br You 'll forgive the squeaks perhaps when you find , as I did , that this stuff is a wonderful dietetic aid
1	By obsessively chewing this product I filled my gut with odorless room air and so helped me lose 25 in 3 monthsbr br Also , it does n't lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight

1	My father could no longer take care of his beloved 6 year old Cocker Spaniel , so I decided to take her into my family
1	When I brought her to NYC she had ear and eye discharge
1	After a check up with a vet that ruled out infection , I decided to try Royal Canin based on the numerous good reviewsWithin a week her ear and eye problems were gone and she dropped a good amount of weight
1	This is going to be the only food that we will be feeding her
1	Our Spaniel has tried several foods in her 6 years , and this is the only one she will eat by itself without any people food being added of course , we still treat her occasionally
1	When we went in for our 12 month toothcleaning appointment , the vet told us to take her home as her teeth did n't need any cleaning for another 6 months , at least
1	Royal Canin was recommended for my dog , but since this line of dog food is specific to breed , it was difficult to find in stores
1	This is food especially designed for Cocker spaniels who have a range of health issuesI have been using this product with three of my dogs and all of them are very happy with it
1	I tired many different dog foods over the 3 yrs I have my cocker spaniel
1	I then came upon this breed specific dog food   figured I 'd try it
1	My dog loves this food and always finishes his food
1	I 've used this for over 1 yr now   he has not tired of it
1	I have seen a significant change for the better in him , he 's more active and doing wellbr br I only buy this brand food for him nowbr br Buster gives it 2 paws up   I give it 5 stars
1	I bought this for my one year old Cocker
1	All their coats look better , they all shed less , eat less , use the bathroom less , my Cocker used to have this one chronic ear since the time I have had her as a puppy that it just gave her problems
1	Her eyes give her less problems
1	And my 7yr old Yorkie he eats less , he used to throw up all the time had the most sensitive tummy
1	Our black lab mix , hot spots and she would just lick her fur off
1	I do mix it roughly 5050 with Naturals dog food blend
1	They are doing greatbr br Sept 2012br I love this breed specific food , however I just went to place my next bimonthly order and I am shocked at the price hike in just over a month
1	I paidbr 4179 on Aug 3 for a 25 lb bag and here it is Sept 20Th and the price has is now 5394 , a difference of 1215 in price
1	This is a huge amount to go up considering that I am assuming this is a price gouge due to the speculation over crops   I will look to my local vet for this product
1	I can get a large bag now less at Petco as well with the discounts they offer
1	They will order a larger bag if you ask
1	fast and great service , my Cavashon Loves this low fat dog food
1	Arrived in great condition , thank you thank you thank you
1	We are Chocolate Moose   Mickey Moose , br br Our nice owner bought this great food for us
1	We love it very much , I have gained 5 lbs
1	because I eat all of Mickey 's food when he is n't looking
1	My 7 year old Cocker Spaniel loves this food and it 's good for him   he needs to lose a few pounds and this is doing the trick
1	Glad I found it on Amazon
1	My 50 lb bag of oatmeal seemed like way too much , but as time went on I found more and more uses for it
1	I have so many recipes that I make weekly that I 'm running out
1	I am using them to make a product designed to increase and enrich the milk production in lactating mothersbr The oats were shipped to me in a timely fashion and the amazing thing is I only paid 499 shipping for 50lbs of oats
1	I encourage anyone who likes oats to order Honeyville Rolled Oats
1	The US made version of this Cadbury chocolate has a distinct taste from the UK version of the chocolate which I have been eating since childhood
1	To all my friends from India   buy this chocolate if it is either made in UK or India otherwise you will be disappointed as I was
1	This version by Hershey is not what you expect from England , Australia or New Zealand Cadbury
1	It does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differentlybr br If you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non Hershey versionbr br Hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality Cadbury chocolate to USA
1	My first taste of this tea saved my trip home from Santa Cruz , when both the hotel and a restaurant had stale powder in the tea bags
1	How I needed my fix
1	A tourist stop with a giant artichoke beckoned , and this Chinese Breakfast   Yunnan Black Tea set me straightbr br Other reviewers have said it tastes odd
1	We love it and it really starts the morning off right
1	The taste is wonderful without any additions and it will remain our tea of choice in the morning and often throughout the day
1	The resealable bags work well , and unopened they protect my large stash , making it easier to manage my subscription
1	I only make it for when I am in the hurry and will not be able to fully enjoy my tea anyway
1	I 've used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious , consistently good quality black tea
1	Mainly I use it and several other Numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha
1	I grew up on Yunnan tea as a child   it was always my mother 's favorite   so I was happy to find an economical source of it of a quality that was great for a large volume habitual tea drinker like me
1	Yunnan is nice in that it will brew dark so you do not need much at a time
1	If you want something that is flowery yet more subtle than Earl Grey this Yunnan or a Keemun may be a nice option to explore
1	I have drunk it pretty much every day for the last five years and I never get tired of it
1	I like a little stevia in it , as I 'm a wimp
1	You can see by the leaves once they are soaked that it is a premium tea
1	I read the other reviews before purchasing am pleased that I did
1	I have purchased other Numi teas and gave generally been happy with all of theri products
1	Having eaten and reeaten my way though all of the DAS caramel range , this remains my alltime favorite , and the one that usually gets the most rave reviews when I share them which is n't an easy thing to do   just try one and you 'll see what I mean
1	I 've been a caramel fan for ages , and while Werthers Butterscotch will do in a pinch , nothing has come closer to what my mother used to make than these
1	They are chewy , buttery , and the little crunches of salt are spectacular OK my mother did n't put salt in hers , this is an improvement
1	Although I did enjoy the other flavor I ordered a tiny bit more , the Chocolate with walnuts one , this was still a very enjoyable flavor
1	I 'd order this or the Chocolate and walnut flavor again for sure , along with more of Das Food 's gourmet salt
1	I will certainly buy them again
1	I missed the mix of rich , buttery , dairy flavor with caramelized sugar that I expect in caramels
1	being an old chemist with a spectrophotometer I am pleased when the chemical is what they say it is this is what they advertized
1	I use it to make my body more alkaline , so it 's great for changing your pH level in your body
1	I recently started using Bob 's Red Mill Baking Soda
1	I 'm very pleased with it 's performance and I can be sure that it is not contaminated with aluminum
1	If you are concerned with an aluminum free product , then this is the product for you
1	Save your hard earned money and buy Bob 's Red Mill regular baking soda
1	Arm   Hammer is great for general cleaning purposes , but for natural beauty and health care , this brand is perfectbr br Just thought you 'd all like to know
1	I almost fell for it myself until I did a little digging around
1	br br PS So as not to let all of amazoncomland feel I am one of those haters who do n't really know what they 're talking about , I LOVE Bob 's Red Mill Co and shall continue purchasing their excellent products
1	However , I will continue to buy this product regardless as it is quality oatmeal at a good pricebr br Edit I 'm on my 4th bag , quality continues to be high
1	I will admit , as a single person I bought these oats with my boyfriend for breakfast food it lasted us for the yearbr br Otherwise it 's an excellent buy
1	I ca n't eat these oats , they have a funny taste to them
1	My kids also think they taste funny
1	My husband thinks they are OK , so he has 50 pounds of oats to eat on his own
1	Of the many purchses I made on Amazon this past December , I was most pleased with the Pocky Chocolate Cream Covered Biscuit Sticks Pack of 10
1	They arrived on time , and they were a ' hit ' as a surprised gift
1	Got these for my kids as Christmas stocking stuffers
1	They love them
1	I 'm not sure how you review something that 's as subjective as taste , but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker , you 'll like this it does n't taste exactly like either of those , but that 's the closest analogy for me
1	The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind , dipped in chocolate , with one end left just normal cracker to you do n't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eatingbr br Here 's some of the nitty gritty details   each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets , that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks
1	The packets themselves are really cleverly designed , with a little slit cut in the folded part , you just grab both sides and pull , and it opens up the package without any hassle   got ta love Japanese product design
1	It does contain milk , wheat , soybeans and sheanut   so if any of these are an issue for you , then you 'll want to pass
1	It also says on the packaging that the facility they 're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts   the product does n't use either of them , but the disclosure is nice if you 're particularly sensitive to eitherbr br Overall a great snack at a great price   the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets , so that 's quite a few snacks
1	One note , if you live in a hot climate , do n't order them in the summer because they will melt together in shipping
1	The product and the concept is good but you will be better off buying it from a supermarket or directly get it from someone visiting Japan
1	First of all , I love the packaging making it heatproof but it would n't have been a problem because I ordered it it winter and they were freakishly cold
1	I also want to thank VeryAsia for the free sample of mi gorengit was delicious
1	I bought these back in January and never got around to reviewing them
1	I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out
1	I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me maybe it had to be imported but when it did , it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever
1	I 'm definitely considering restocking on this in the future if I ca n't find a local storebr br EDIT Oct 11 , 2012br br Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchasebr br So I decided to restock after I could n't fight the craving anymore
1	What I received was not the picture shown on the front page 2 per pack japanese pocky , it was a 1 per pack pockyish thing from Thailand
1	Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door
1	The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth , this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouthbr br Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor
1	I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a not eat everything at once and b avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items
1	I can honestly say that I wo n't be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much
1	I wo n't change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3
1	If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received
1	That includes our 3 year old
1	I discovered these snacks at an anime convention though I 'd heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them
1	They are very , very slim sticks of biscuity stuff the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels that have a charming tiny popping crispness
1	The chocolate flavor , a nice nonbitter , nondark , generically pleasing chocotaste , seems to be the most popular given how fast they sell out at cons , but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream
1	We all know it 's supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet
1	Unless you 're really prone to bingeeating or ca n't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number
1	10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat , 3 of them saturated
1	In fact , just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effectbr br If you love the flavor of coconutchocolate together like Almond Joy try the coconut chocolate ones
1	Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout ' caramel delights cookies which are , in turn , similar to the old Yes Yes cookies from the seventies or sobr br Anyway , if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those sticklooking treats , or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats , this is what they were eating
1	  Fun treatsbr br However , with this crazy hot summer , I 'd recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall 's cooler weather
1	You might get a sticky , clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather
1	In South Florida , Tate 's Comics has them in a variety of flavorsand FRESH and NOT MELTED
1	Pocky is an incredibly good snack , but more than that , I was impressed with Very Asia 's packaging
1	I had stupidly ordered something as easy to melt as chocolate in the dead heat of summer
1	TT So of course I was expecting all the pocky in my 10 boxes to be melted away , but they took the special care to put the pocky in a box reading PROTECT FROM HEAT and my pocky arriving in perfect condition
1	I love Very Asia more than anything now
1	I think the Pocky did not get stored rightly
1	Many of them stick together , and whenever I want to split them up , it just becomes very messy
1	Now I need to clean up my desk every time after I have it
1	Everyone loves Pocky and if they say they do n't they are lying lol
1	These where great could nt stop eating thembr Lowest priced anywhere and will buy even more next timebr Ca nt say enough about these , they where shipped faster than what I paid to have shipped alsobr Thank you so much
1	I had bought Pocky when on vacation and enjoyed it but living where there are no Asian stores I have to shop on the internet
1	Then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about 60 the length of a normal snack bar
1	If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25 of the space inside the boxbr br As far as taste goes they are soso
1	Celiacs , who are used to inferior products , wo n't be disappointed in the taste of this onebr br I 've also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging
1	But when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarterbr br I really want to like this company
1	I bought their granola many times , always wanting to like it , but it is some of the worst food I 've ever had
1	The clusters are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for gerbils than peoplebr br All in all I would not recommend Enjoy Life foods
1	This was the first peanut free product I bought for my son
1	I thought they were tasty
1	For some reason they think they are strawberry bars
1	Amazon has a wonderful price and I just wish it could be a subscribe item
1	I have recently stopped eating a number of allergens dairy , soy , nuts and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions
1	I threw them away
1	I would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free
1	My daughter had extensive food allergies as an infanttoddler and we bought these bars consistently
1	She still has the nut and egg allergy so I like that I can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe
1	Unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars all varieties they have been hard as a rock and my daughter wo n't eat them
1	I have tried them myself and thought I might break a tooth
1	I had them on subscribe and save which I have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat
1	I want to love these bars and I love everything the company stands for and actually really like their cookies , but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing
1	I hope they address the issue and I will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture
1	I find that they have a good berry taste
1	i love them
1	HOWEVER I DONT APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT I OPENED MY NEW BOX AND THE CUT 14 OF IT OFF
1	I AM NOT A TODDLER I NEED A REAL SIZE BAR PLEASE
1	I was extremely disappionted when I opened my shipment of Enjoy Life On The Go Bars Very Berry , Carmel Apple , and Cocoa Loco
1	I then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes I still had at home
1	Next , I tastetested , and let my 3 year old help
1	He would n't eat the new onesand I ca n't blame him
1	My 10 year old son ate one and did n't like them
1	I ate one and agreed as did my husband
1	We do n't have any negative reactions to the ingredients and though we do n't buy many pre packaged foods , these work for ' onthego '
1	Our family tried several varieties and I prefer the Cocoa Loco Bars they 're almost like a Tootsie Roll to methough I ca n't eat Tootsie Rolls , so this is a great substitute for that occasional craving
1	My family prefers the Very Berry Bars because they can eat those when they miss breakfast , need a healthy snack , or my son will take them on his cross country running meets
1	They are very dense and fillingnot a ' soft bar ' and we always eat them while having some liquid to drink at the same time
1	My 6mo son was diagnosed with some severe FA and since he 's still breastfed , I had to drastically alter my dietbr br Before learning about this brand , I was stuck eating chicken breasts with potatoes for every meal
1	So when I stumbled upon this at my local Whole Foods , I was very excited to try itbr br Overall , I really like them
1	It 's not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box which really is n't that bigbr br I know alot of people complain about the sizepackaging and I agree somewhat
1	I like the Berry flavor the best , it 's the closest to real , non FA specialty flavor
1	Overally , I 'm grateful for these bars because now I can tote several in my diaper bag and car and know that when I really need a quick snack , I wo n't be left stranded
1	This is an item he loves and is a convenience for me
1	I feel good giving them to him and they taste great
1	If you are looking for a great gluten free snack you wo n't be sorry you chose this product
1	Yeah , we 're gluten free , so our food is a lot more dense than other food , but honestly , can we not have normal sized , good tasting granola bars
1	They are OK , but my husband only eats them when we are in car
1	We keep them there for a celiac snack
1	He wo n't eat them otherwise
1	They are definitely raspberry , but are kind of drybr   We have never tried any other snack bars , so in all honesty they may be the norm
1	I do n't knowbr   We DO like Enjoy Life 's other productsbr   They are GF , have no MSG or related products or aspartates
1	They are a little smaller and you may still be hungry if it is for a meal
1	I give one to my 5 year old son for breakfast and he is still a little hungry for more
1	Either that or they taste so good he wants more
1	Recently diagnosed a glutenintolerant , I have been looking for products that allow me to resume a semblance of my former life
1	My son Loves these fruit bars they are smaller than your typical wheat fruit bars
1	My suggestion it to get your child to like these first before you try the chocolate ones Now my son favors them chocolate ones MORE than the berry ones
1	If you want a really good snack bar try these , they are healthy and taste as good as any granola bar , but without the gluten
1	Then scoop it up and put it in your mouthbr br That 's how disgusting this bar isbr br I have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful , IT HAS NONE
1	I 've done nutritional coaching for 30 years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellentbr br This neanderthalera gluten free bar is so bad I want to go to my local grocery store , take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store perhaps , if there 's a trash compactor
1	just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this productbr br Save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything elsebr br Enjoy Life bars
1	My brother bought me a pound of this coffee for Christmas
1	He told me that weaver was the original roaster for Pete 's coffee , he eventually split off and started his own roaster
1	Well let me tell you the stuff is delicious
1	I 've never been married to a brand of coffee , usually would buy the Starbucks 25 lb bag at Costco , or whatever looked good at Trader Joes , but Weavers is in a class of it 's own
1	I 'm subscribing to guarantee I can have this stuff delivered to me regularly
1	I must say you wo nt be displeased with your purchase , this is a must buy
1	I run The American Pavilion in Cannes and Weaver 's was by far and away our most popular coffee sponsor
1	We did a booming business this year
1	You 'll be so happy you did
1	Better packaging might solve thisbr br If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells , or are entertaining and want a conversation piece , then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list
1	My husband , son and I often share this wonderful tea after dinner
1	However , I do have issues with the product , namely , me and my family members ca n't take the smell
1	The taste is horrible so I put it in a lotion cream and rubbed it on my skin
1	This was a few weeks ago and though I 've since changed my sheets , the scent is still in my bed
1	Ultimately , I stopped using it because it made me smell in a way I did not like
1	We introduced it when they were 7 months old and now they 're 10 months
1	I 'm glad they are eating something green because we could n't get them to eat the one with peas when we tried at 7 months , but we got them to eat the peas later at 9 monthsbr br Their favorite vegetable is sweet potato and we 've also tried sweet potato with cinnamon
1	They love all the fruit varietiesbr br I 'm glad they love this one because lentils and brown rice form a complete protein , although a view of the ingredients shows that lentils is not one of the prime ingredientsbr br This one also has carrots and I 've heard all babies like carrots
1	I do n't know if they would like it without the carrots
1	I have n't seen this one   lentils and brown rice   in our local stores , so I 'm glad to get it here
1	I 've ordered an unbelievable number of cases of jars of different types and only had one jar arrive brokenbr br Ingredients per label Water , organic apples , organic carrots , organic brown rice , organic lentils , organic canola oilbr br This has 70 calories , 10 protein , 100 vitamin A , 4 vitamin C , 2 calcium and 4 ironbr br I 'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult
1	My twin 10month old babies treat this one as dessert
1	Their first Earth 's Best jar they loved was straight sweet potatoes
1	I recommend this flavor brandbr br Ingredients per label Water , organic sweet potatoes , organic apricot puree , mechanically separated organic chicken , organic brown rice flourbr br The rice flour absorbed the water and gave it a real nice consistency , and the sweet potatoes gave it a nice colorbr br Nutrition per label 80 calories , 15 protein , 90 vitamin A , 2 vitamin C , 2 calcium and 6 ironbr br This one had the most vitamin A of all Earth 's Best jars I 've tried
1	I 've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult
1	I liked getting this one for my twin 10month olds because it has such interesting ingredients , particularly the zucchini and the garbanzo beans
1	I like the fact that it 's vegetarian yet I believe it has a complete protein since it also has brown rice
1	They have liked everything that has carrotsbr br I have the subscription for this one as I really like the ingredients and the fact that I 'm giving the babies food that is naturally greenbr br Ingredients per the label Water , organic corn , organic zucchini , organic green beans , organic brown rice , organic carrots , organic garbanzo beans , organic canola oilbr br This has 70 calories , 8 protein , 40 vitamin A , 10 vitamin C , 2 calcium and 2 iron
1	I 've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult
1	Baby loved this one , but as he has progressed I had to cut this one out because it is too runny and if I have to move the spoon quickly out of the way of his grabby hands , it is all over
1	I think they could use a little less water maybe a little more potato to make it more the consistency of the turkey dinner one
1	You can add cranberries if you want to take it to the next level
1	I just ca n't find nonsweetened and nondried cranberries even at the better food storesbr br Apples , carrots and turkey taste good to my 10month old growing twin girls
1	The whole barley flour absorbs the water to give it an acceptable consistencybr br The ingredients per the label Water , organic apples , organic carrots , mechanically separated organic turkey , organic whole barley flourbr br In addition to 12 protein and 50 vitamin A , it has 6 calcium and 4 ironbr br I 'm very pleased my babies like this food and are being introduced to so many foods through Earth 's Best
1	I 've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult
1	I wish it came in larger portions since my 10 month old always wants 2 jars
1	For me I love that i can get lentils , there are n't many stage 2 or 3 vegetarian choices
1	The other posters say they notified Earth 's Best about this in August and they are still selling it without checking or recalling
1	No more earth 's best for my little guy
1	I am taking my business elsewhere and I am very sad that organic company is selling baby food with plastic and bpa in their jars
1	They got ta do better than this to get my business
1	I like the Earth 's Best baby food line because of the organic ingredients
1	Amazon has great prices especially if you subscribe and free delivery to your doorstop , which is convenient when you 're a busy mom
1	As other reviewers have stated , it 's a bit runnier that other EB 's stage 2 foods , so I add some oatmeal to it
1	She had problems with constipation for about 25 months , sometimes going up to 10 days before we had to give her a suppository , and then I discovered that this food makes her poop every time I also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber
1	I think I purchased 50 jars so far
1	I do n't know how everyone else got these broken , but when I received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap , not a single jar was broken
1	My son loves them and the price was great and I had no issues at all
1	I would love to say that I have the time to make my son 's food everyday
1	Honestly , I do make it most of the time , but some days , you just do n't have the timeenergy to get it all done
1	Before I bought this baby food , I read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it , its like a dessert , yadda yadda yadda
1	We love earth 's best organic baby food , but this is not the tastiest one
1	Soft smooth texture   my little one devours this oneit is one of the best meatveg dinners we have found
1	I can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what I wanted to mix in there it was horribly runny , like spooning formula into his mouth
1	My daughter was not a big fan of baby food , especially any with proteins , but she did LOVE this one
1	My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor , so it 's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you do n't know a particular baby 's preferencesbr Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth 's Best , especially for having chicken
1	I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture , and she liked that just fine , but it is an extra step
1	I have twin girls , they both loved the Vegetable Turkey Dinner
1	I normally love Earth 's Best products as does my son
1	However , tonight after I 'd given him half the jar I thought I would try some since it was a new flavor and I realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it
1	As this is my first child and I do n't have any experience with this kind of thing , I called poison control
1	They said he would be ok and once I knew he was fine , I got really angry
1	I looked it up online and found that Earth 's Best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it
1	My son really enjoys Earth 's Best lentil
1	I introduced my daughter to Earth 's Best Organic Turkey Vegetable Dinner at 4 months
1	A bit early , but she 's advanced , as she was 6 weeks overdue
1	But , I bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite
1	Of all of them , this is also my least favorite
1	We received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today
1	I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature I put them in a bowl and microwave for 69 seconds and taste ok
1	When I tasted this , I made a face because it was so yucky
1	To her credit , my 8 month old daughter ate some bites , but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors
1	I 'm not a fan myself , but I 'm not the one eating it
1	Any time I can get a variety of vegetables into my baby in one sitting , I 'm a happy mom
1	The Rice and Lentil dinner is our son 's absolute favorite
1	I do n't know why but he gobbles this up every time
1	He enjoys most of the Earth 's Best foods and we have only found a couple he does n't eat anything with too much apple which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination
1	My 712 month old absolutely loves this oneby far , it is her favorite jarred baby food
1	I like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food , and I 'm not ready to introduce her to meats yetbr br I do subscribe   save , which brings the price down to 080jar
1	The bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find   I have to go to Whole Foods
1	My regular grocery store and Target carry Earth 's Best , but not this blend
1	My daughter likes it so much , though , that I would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices
1	I always try the food before I feed it to my daughter and this one is actually pretty good
1	She gets all excited when I make it for her
1	From 6 month to 12 month , my son barely ate any solid food
1	We tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that he 'd actually finish the whole jar
1	I did n't expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it , but I guessed it wrongbr Now he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater
1	His current favorite seems to be tofu , but he still loves corn , zucchini , brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this
1	I highly recommend to try this baby foodbr br Also , Earth 's Best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well
1	My son does n't really like any snacks from Gerber brand , but he likes most of the products from Earth 's Best
1	Reviewing baby food is objective since all children are different , so I hope letting you know the consistency and texture help
1	This tastes so good that apparently our cat thinks so too   he 's constantly poking his furry face around every time we pop open one of these
1	I know some people have complained about the poor packaging but I believe that must 've been fixed bc I 've not had any problems at all   in fact , they securely bubble wrap these , then place them in an aircushioned box and it all arrives perfectly every time
1	I have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review , but they like all the flavors , the textures are great , and the jars open easily
1	My son started eating this when he was around 8 months old he 's now 14 months old and it 's one of his favorites
1	Unfortunately , they do n't carry it at the local grocery store they carry other varieties of Earth 's Best just not this one or his other favorites , SpinachPotatoes and Spaghetti with Cheese they do carry it at some of the Whole Foods so I buy them there
1	I 'm so glad to find them on Amazon
1	I get TIRED of ringing up a gazillion little jars at the storebr br We use this as a base and mix in other things   bits of cooked broccoli , small pieces of meat
1	I 've also started adding spices to introduce him to new flavors
1	My baby loves Rice and Lentil and is one of her favorite things to eat
1	If we are going somewhere I wo n't be able to warm the food she will eat this one cold
1	We tried 3rd foods on her and she does n't like the texture of them
1	This is really good for her and she likes it , so we keep buying it
1	My son loves the Best Earth 's baby food and his favorite seems to be the Vegetable and Turkey
1	He smiles at every mouthfulbr br I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for healthy feeding the organic way
1	All the food I feed my son is through Earth 's Best
1	I usually make my baby 's food it 's so easy , steam fruits   veggies and puree but sometimes I do n't have enough time to cook and I buy Earth 's Best baby foodsbaby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but did n't like this one
1	When I tried it I understood why , I would n't eat it myself either it tastes nasty my poor baby immediately I made her a homemade potato , zucchini ,   asparagus puree and she loved it
1	My six month old baby loves the Earth 's Best 2nd Sweet Potato Chicken Dinner   it 's his favorite
1	He seems to love all the Earth 's Best 2nd foods   fruits , vegetables , and dinners
1	After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge , it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out
1	It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has , especially zucchinibr I had to update my review today , because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food
1	I notified Earth 's Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing , but I am not giving my baby this food any more , even though she likes it , that 's it for us
1	The earths best he eats the most , this one is a little thicker than his original chickensweet potato favorite which is very runny
1	I 'd continue to buy but I 'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jarsshattered too many
1	I did n't eat any but my baby liked it
1	She said it was savory but sweet and it reminded her of fine dining in Tuscany
1	Also I like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste
1	And if you do n't recycle then you and I have nothing in common and you should stop reading here
1	Nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy
1	You just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day
1	I just wanted to post here that I found small bits of plastic in this food as I was feeding my 9 month old
1	So please be careful if you buy this or are considering itbr br My daughter LOVES this food it 's actually her favorite
1	This is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over 2 months
1	I am a true Seattle coffee addict , and I have never had a better coffee candy
1	Sent this basket to my father for his birthday
1	I needed something in a pinch and it came even earlier than expectedSO THANK YOU AGAIN
1	I got it for my Girlfriend for her Birthday
1	I love dark chocolate , so I loved the dark chocolate almonds
1	Next time I 'll give the Organic version of this product to someone close so they share with me
1	As a child my facorite memory was drinking Sassafras tea made from fresh sassafras with my Granddad
1	I found that to get the taste I remember I needed 2 bags per cup
1	I grew up in Ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful
1	I ordered this online and received it in just a few days 3
1	I purchased this tea for my neighbor as a present , she has been looking for sassafras tea for a long time , I did n't realize it was so hard to find
1	I heard some great things about Sassafras and wanted to try it
1	I was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated
1	for about 2 years he would complain to be about how he has n't had this tea since he was about 9 finally , after many nights of drinking my tea annoyed , i bought him the tea so he 'd shut up
1	After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea
1	I looked online and found it at Amazoncom
1	As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags
1	I thought I 'd order a box to try
1	It also did n't have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras rootbr br I 've never had real Sassafras tea made with the root so I do n't know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not
1	I did not care for this product at all , I thought it was the same tea my sisters and I use to drink when we were in elementary school
1	I found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree
1	I purchased this because I read that it was a natural cure for hivesUm , how about NOT
1	Luckily , a coworker of mine loves this stuff reminds him of his grandmother and I gave it to him
1	For example , if you order these in April and the batch you receive has a June use by date , it may be a stretch to consume the 300 bags before the seeds start going rancid on you
1	Since they 're roasted in oil and unsalted , these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety , even if refrigerated upon receiptbr br Amazon does n't seem to specify use by dates for the food products they sell , so it 's a gamble for the purchaser
1	I 'm assuming that Amazon wo n't ship stuff that has expired , but they probably ship out the oldest stock first , and the use by date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice
1	I love Panang Curry but would rather avoid the white rice that most restaurants serve with it
1	So decided to try making my own , and with this product , I get exactly what I want , hot tasty Panang Curry adding lots of fresh veggies , tofu and brown rice
1	I purchased this for a friend who loves to cook only to find out that I paid 3 times more than what I should be
1	1395 for 4 cans is highway robbery now that I know that I can purchase one can for around 109
1	A horrible horrible mistakean expensive mistakethey advertised it as peanut butter cookies which is why I bought them since everyone else had peanut butter chocolate cookies when I just wanted plan peanut butter cookieshowever when I received them I found out they were the chocolate peanut butter ones but I thought okay I 'll try them and omg I almost threw up from the taste
1	If they had a zero before the stars I would rate it a zero instead of 1 star
1	I 'm not from the south , but live in SoFla where sometimes we get a southern influence
1	The gravy mix I am reviewing , PIONEER COUNTRY GRAVY is DELICIOUS
1	I 've tried others Publix brand , Mc Cormick , ect , but this is the BEST
1	I chose to mix 12 water 12 milk ,   2 cooked , chopped sausage links , and it was phenomenal on my
1	I heard you can put it on potatoesveggies and chicken , make soups and add for seasoning
1	I have used Pioneer Gravy for a number of years
1	Its great to be able to get sugar this wayIts not good to eat but if you are going to use sugar at least this is not processed to an unhealthy state on top of what sugar does to your body , and i am helping the fair trade farmersIt is a good thing all aroundI am happy i can get it in Amazon
1	I am a coffee fanatic but have always stayed away from these because I never liked instant coffee and my assumption was that this would be similar
1	I really enjoy the Starbucks VIA instant coffee   but I drink so much , it is rather expensive so I thought I would give this a try
1	Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the taste
1	I bought my first 38 pack at my local grocery store for about 7
1	That seemed a little high but I figured I would check online to find the best price
1	As I started calculating all of the online prices , they are charging about 7 bucks for the 19 count
1	I would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper
1	I do n't think these coffee bags are as good as fresh ground fresh brewed coffee , but they taste far better than instant coffee
1	I highly recommend it to any coffee lover when you have access to very hot water but do n't have access to a coffee maker
1	Individual wrapped and sealed bags allow you to take one tiny tea like bag with you in your pocket or purse to your early morning meetings
1	I keep Regular bags and Decaf bags in my home at all timesbr Never have to drink old coffee
1	Especially when I need to stay up late to study or to wake up after 2 hours of sleep
1	My primary point with this review is to note that this packaging is less expensive than the other size offered by Folger
1	You get more coffee for less moneybr br   I recently started drinking coffee again after a lapse of many years
1	Since I did n't know how many cups a day I would use , I wanted to avoid the fuss of a coffeemaker
1	I was delighted to find these Folger 's bagsbr br   They brew a very nice tasting cup of coffee
1	I 'm not any kind of coffee expert , so I do n't know what special terms might be used
1	All I know is that if I let the bag seep for a bit more than a minute , it sure tastes good
1	Thanks to my very much better half , I 've also learned that each of these bags will produce at least two good cups of coffeebr br   Very convenient , very easy , very tasty
1	I intend to take some of these with me when I travel as an alternative to the inroom coffee makers or yeck
1	We ca n't have any kind of coffee maker at work , so we 're forced to buy at the inhouse coffee shop or Starbuck 's across the street
1	These are great for at work , just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee
1	I gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit
1	And I 'm glad I did
1	This tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green matcha tea I 've had , and I look forward to experiencing any of the purported health benefits of rooibos that I 've read about
1	I tried this before having normal red tea so I waited to review
1	I decided to give Pure Matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive
1	The quality of Pure Matcha 's products surpasses that of all others I have tried stays fresh , has a consistent texture and tastes great
1	I highly recommend Pure Matcha and will continue to purchase
1	This is the very best marinade you can buy as far as I am concernedof course , everyone to his or her own tastes , but all in all , I think anyone will like itI give it five stars
1	It does n't compromise of taste either , I use it as a Soy Sauce substitute and have found it to have superior taste and it looks and acts just like any good marinade should
1	If you are Celiac or Gluten intolerant , or even just watching you salt intake , this product is a way to have your steak and marinade it too
1	My poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try andbr our family really enjoyed it
1	You can smell the flavors immediately when you open the bottle
1	I put this on everything and tend to go through one bottle a week
1	I was never much of a hot sauce fan until I tasted Black Market Hot Sauce
1	I was listning to the radio one morning and the createrowner was giving an interview , It sounded interesting
1	Happy to see I can buy it online at Amazon
1	I have loved going out to some of my favorite resturants in town and seeing that they are offering this great productI really enjoy putting on my my breakfast burritos
1	They have this in a local diner that I eat in regularly
1	I use it on all kinds of foods and I love it
1	I was surprised to find it on Amazon just stumbled across it
1	I was browsing around on Amazon looking for gifts and was very pleased to see my favorite sauce on here
1	I will just order and have shipped to my friends
1	Habanero is my favorite , I love the heat and the tangy spiciness
1	I buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have
1	So far I have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing
1	My fiance and I use them nearly daily and I just picked up 3 more
1	BLACK MARKET HOT SAUCE IS WONDERFUL My husband Loves this Habenero sauce , its very very flavorful with a nice kick to it
1	We used it for everything and you can use it with any mealbr br I like the fact that there are so many different levels of spicyness
1	We love the medium   habenero
1	Thank you for your hard work guys
1	the owner is a cool dude , He 's dropped off free bottles to me in my mailbox
1	i stole the first bottle out of a friends fridge after i tasted and been hooked since
