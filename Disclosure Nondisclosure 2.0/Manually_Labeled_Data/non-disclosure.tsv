0	Plastic bottle
0	It does have a convenient squirt top
0	But overall , not very hot or tasty , and made mostly from jalapentildeos
0	The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better
0	Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanutsthe peanuts were actually small sized unsalted
0	Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as Jumbo
0	This is a confection that has been around a few centuries
0	It is a light , pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts   in this case Filberts
0	And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar
0	And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven
0	Not too chewy , and very flavorful
0	I highly recommend this yummy treat
0	The flavor is very medicinal

0	Good for their digestion
0	Also good for small puppies
0	I do n't know if it 's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients , but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind
0	One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other did n't
0	The higher food sits going stale
0	They both really go for this food
0	And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week
0	I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different

0	This offer is a great price and a great taste , thanks Amazon for selling this productbr br Staral
0	There is no escaping the fact , however , that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation
0	Still , the McCann 's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal
0	It 's even better than the organic , allnatural brands I have tried
0	All the varieties in the McCann 's variety pack taste good
0	Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff
0	Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy , tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum
0	But this is a convenience product
0	Maybe the guar gum is why , after sitting in the bowl a while , the instant McCann 's becomes too thick and gluey
0	This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand
0	It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup , so not only does it have a better sweetness , but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you
0	The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too
0	Plus they do n't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart
0	Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl
0	McCann 's regular oat meal is excellent , too , but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning
0	For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store
0	br br Thanks , br Abby
0	What else do you need to know
0	Oatmeal , instant make it with a half cup of lowfat milk and add raisinsnuke for 90 seconds
0	More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something
0	It 's still just oatmeal
0	Mmm , convenient
0	FOUND IT TO BE VERY TASTEFULL WHEN MADE WITH WATER OR POWDERED MILK
0	IT GOES GOOD WITH OJ
0	She has this almost every morning and likes all flavors
0	br a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB001EO5QW8McCANN 'S Instant Irish Oatmeal , Variety Pack of Regular , Apples   Cinnamon , and Maple   Brown Sugar , 10Count Boxes Pack of 6a
0	Convenient , healthy , very quick , excellent quality , and extremely cheap
0	McCann 's makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur , whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour , to the sloth addled instant , which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes
0	Tastes great and very healthy
0	McCann 's Oatmeal is a good quality choice
0	For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes , this is excellent
0	This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands , but it is somewhat mushy and does n't have quite as much flavor either
0	Good oatmeal
0	I like the apple cinnamon the best
0	The flavors are good
0	I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor
0	The regular is fine with brown sugar added
0	The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK
0	This is a very quick , easy and satisfying breakfast and I 'll order this brand again , but not the variety
0	I 'll get all Maple and Brown Sugar
0	This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores
0	There is nothing healthy about it
0	It is just carbs and sugars
0	Save your money and get something that at least has some taste
0	This oatmeal is not good
0	Its mushy , soft , I do n't like it
0	Quaker Oats is the way to go
0	So i m here to buy more , and noticed there were no reviews yet , well now there is
0	Perfect for us
0	This was n't in stock the last time I looked
0	They are hot
0	It requires a beverage as advertised , a glass of very cold milk , and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run
0	He 'll be so insulted
0	we 're used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy
0	doubt very much habanero is used at all
0	could take it up a notch or two
0	These beans Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura seem to be wellsuited for this method
0	The first and second cracks are distinct , and I 've roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time
0	The aroma is strong and persistent
0	The taste is smooth , velvety , yet lively
0	We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill about 13 of the bag at a time
0	The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too
0	More importantly , the coffee is smooth no bitter aftertaste
0	Deal was awesome
0	Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters
0	I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store 's candy
0	It is chocolate , what can I say
0	Great variety of everything our family loves
0	With a family of six it goes fast here
0	Perfect variety
0	Kit Kat , Reeses , take five and more
0	Great product , nice combination of chocolates and perfect size
0	The bags had plenty , and they were shipped promptly
0	The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies
0	The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many
0	Watch your prices with this
0	This bag of candy online is pretty expensive , it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores , other than that , its a good combination of my favorite candy
0	
0	Same for desert racing in the buggy , the camelbaks were always laced with the powder
0	Now we have the Fizzwhat a great product
0	Firstly , its Hammer 's endurolyte product so it 's great , endurance athlete 's the world over use their products
0	Second its convenient , handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz
0	Third it tastes great
0	The camelbaks always get the Fizz now
0	I can not recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough
0	This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides
0	Pop 1 into each water bottle and you 're set
0	Flavor is fine and goes down easy
0	I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue
0	Gatorade was n't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a lowcarb alternative
0	The zero carb sports drinks did n't help so what to do
0	There is no hint of sweetness , and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice
0	The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I 've tasted
0	But in retrospect , the price is a little ridiculous esp
0	when you add on the shipping
0	this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds
0	my fault
0	These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality
0	The bears even have little faces
0	At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff bears , rings , snakes , balls , worms , whatever are about 10 lb
0	These twin packs of 45 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I 'm concerned
0	I 'm probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin ' things
0	Consumed
0	Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area
0	I love grape flavored candysoda and these are pretty good
0	There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion , but these are well worth it for the price
0	I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink
0	The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles , and the gummy bears are awesome frozen
0	They are delicious
0	It arrived fresh and intact
0	Very good size
0	I froze half for later use
0	The pastry was soft , the jam was really good and the taste was great
0	They were gone in no time
0	My guests were really impressed
0	Buyer Beware Please
0	This sweetener is not for everybody
0	Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body
0	Nausea , diarrhea   headaches can also be experienced
0	The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before
0	I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping
0	As the symptoms passed , this too was very unpleasant
0	Thank goodness I 'd eaten only a little
0	I still ended up with all the same sideeffects but for a much shorter duration
0	Some people can use maltitol to their heart 's content but others , like me , can have a bad reaction to it
0	It is okay
0	No tea flavor at all
0	Just whole brunch of artifial flavors
0	It is not returnable
0	I wasted 20 bucks
0	These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix
0	Unfortunately , they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate
0	These taste really good
0	I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture
0	There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items
0	Order in cold weather and buy enough to last
0	
0	The taste was great , but the berries had melted
0	May order again in winter
0	it tastes crisp
0	This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat
0	Great gift for all ages
0	I have been looking for this for a while now , not for food science , but for something more down to earth
0	I also bought lowfat noninstant milk powder and regular milk powder
0	The noninstant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant lowfat milk , but does not dissolve good in cold water   which is not a problem for hot coffee
0	Also , I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it 's own
0	Take the time to experiment
0	Maybe you do n't use any lowfat milk
0	Or do n't add any flavorings
0	It is up to you
0	I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients
0	Awesome dog food
0	As soon as I changed to a different formula , the scratching stopped
0	So glad Natural Balance has other choices
0	My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food
0	Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food
0	Great food
0	I love the idea of one food for all ages   breeds
0	Ît 's a real convenience as well as a really good product
0	My 3 dogs eat less , have almost no gas , their poop is regular and a perfect consistency , what else can a mom ask for
0	
0	I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food
0	This food is great   all ages dogs
0	They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick
0	What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties
0	This is the same food we get at pet store
0	But it 's delivered to my door
0	And for the same price or slightly less
0	I 've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food
0	Since switching I have n't had any issues
0	It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for largersmaller sized dogs
0	I 'm sold
0	
0	Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods
0	This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the foodbr This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved
0	This was the second one we tried , and it has been working ever since
0	It 's for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food like chicken or beef
0	We will not be buying this again
0	It 's also super expensive
0	The only draw back , shipping cost
0	These are very heavy
0	Arrived slightly thawed
0	My parents would n't accept it
0	However , the company was very helpful and issued a full refund
0	The crust on these tarts are perfect
0	These are absolutely scrumptuous
0	The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are
0	What a nice alternative to an apple pie
0	Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing
0	Easy to prepare
0	I like Creme Brulee
0	I loved that these were so easy
0	Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil
0	They look amazing and taste great
0	I will be ordering more
0	not what I was expecting in terms of the company 's reputation for excellent home delivery products
0	I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite
0	These are even better than the ones from the Amish market
0	They are fantastic , and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom
0	They wo nt go to waste
0	I love asparagus
0	Up until very recently , I had never had pickled asparagus
0	I 've got 2 jars left
0	Gon na need more
0	
0	I wanted things that were tasty , nonfat and low in calories
0	I came home with about a dozen items
0	That 's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus
0	This Tillen Farms brand is really , really good
0	It 's the best I can recall
0	There 's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in the bottom of the jar which I 'm looking forward to eating
0	I ca n't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says only 60 calories per jar
0	I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix
0	I have been drinking this tea for a long time now
0	I used to have to purchase it at a doctor 's office because it was n't available elsewhere
0	Wonderful taste
0	I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping
0	I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits
0	Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier coffe and other drinks do not   the only healthier drink is quality cold water
0	This green tea has a beautiful golden color , the taste is bright and fresh
0	I recommend adding a tiny amount of YS
0	Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too
0	The one shipped displays NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea , whereas the Amazon package displays CAFFENE FREE
0	The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag
0	So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it
0	this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted it 's clean , bright , freshbr br great deliveryagain quality just try it
0	I love , love this green tea
0	I will definitely order from this seller again
0	Thanks
0	I love this tea
0	This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or midday snack
0	Great routine and treat for kids
0	The female , younger one took to it right away , and the older male , who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc in it , and would usually refuse a diet change , actually liked it too
0	He is a posh cat after all
0	Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal
0	Is that right
0	She 's tiny , but happy and agile
0	Mainly , he loved the taste even more
0	That is also according to my holistic veterinarian
0	It stopped her problems
0	It aids in digestion since theok sorrysmells are gone if ya know what I mean
0	Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food
0	The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well
0	It 's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me
0	Innova 's manufacturer was recently purchased by ProcterGamble
0	I began looking for a replacement
0	It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters
0	My holistic vet recommended this , along with a few other brands
0	The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear
0	One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef
0	This formula is one of the few she can eat , and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet
0	Both of my kitties are very active , have soft shiny fur , and neither are fat
0	Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth , also
0	Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food
0	They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great
0	They are fit and not over weight
0	This vendor ships extremely fast
0	Too bad it 's way too expensive here on Amazon
0	It is n't hot at all to a chilihead like me , but it sure is good
0	Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor
0	I do n't find this to be the case with this soup
0	Any flavor is killed off by the burn
0	I really loved the spicy flavor these had
0	I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite
0	I love this flavor of ramen
0	It 's unbelievable
0	It 's fibrous like the real ginger , has that spicy kick to it , but it 's perfect with the sugar   calms it down
0	It 's very worth the 40 for 5lbs of it
0	Delicious
0	Now I can enjoy it without traveling
0	I keep trying other brands cheaper brands
0	Stupid me
0	This ginger IS soooo worth the money
0	Tender , moist and never a let down
0	What a surprise
0	He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it
0	This product was a God send for him
0	Thank you all for it
0	Because it 's bite size it 's easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick
0	My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping
0	I love thesevery tasty
0	Savings are about a 100 a bag
0	I use subscribe and save on these and several other product
0	I love subscribe and save
0	
0	If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children , then be sure to try these
0	We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack
0	Great item , great price too , highly recommend
0	I might be mistaken , but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size
0	If they did do that , it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal , having so many pieces after all
0	The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience
0	As it is , you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size it is not the same
0	This is one of the best tasting salsas I 've ever had
0	My daughters love it too
0	The salsa is not too sweet , just sweet enough and although it 's mild , it has a nice little kick to it
0	At this price , it 's a steal
0	Therefore , the bottoms were broken on all three bottles
0	NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER FED EX IS CAREFUL , IT 'S GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE
0	ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER
0	BARBARA L S
0	This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack
0	The other two that come with it are not worth your money
0	This is the best cornmeal
0	I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding
0	Also fried some oysters with this meal , it gave them a great texture and flovor
0	This is a fabulous marinade
0	DEFINITELY worth the price
0	Super cheap and super easy
0	Love it
0	Works with chicken fish beef or pork
0	Fast easy and makes it taste excellent
0	Plus buying in bulk is more than 50 off from box stores
0	It actually tastes pretty good
0	These singles sell for 250   336 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles
0	Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite , but truly this is not a good buy
0	AWESOME
0	I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful
0	This jello is wonderful
0	Great made as regular Jello too
0	Yummy
0	What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use
0	This box should last our family the year no problem
0	Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will
0	Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket
0	We love it
0	Shakes well , no clumping and flows freely
0	The tuna , tomato combination is delicious
0	The taste of the tuna was not pleasant , too much basil and other spices for me
0	I 'm not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict , gave this a shot
0	The tuna tastes like it 's good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland
0	It 's better than something plain but it did n't pack the punch I was hoping for
0	It 's still a great option for a low calorie , low fat meal
0	I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there
0	Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come
0	There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack
0	You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor
0	It 's dark , syrupy , sour , and a little sweet
0	A dab of this and I forget about dessert
0	It 's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone
0	Yum
0	I 'm going to try making fesenjan next
0	Used this in Moroccan recipes , as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water
0	Wonderful , wonderful stuff
0	I ca n't even return these or ask for a refund , because food is not returnable
0	Will find a different brand to use
0	For now , I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away
0	Besides being smaller than runts , they look the same and have the same consistency
0	Yucky stuff
0	Trying to return with vendor
0	Also when I received the item , the packaging was not great
0	The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope
0	They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy
0	I purchased 5
0	I love this stuff in milkbr It 's much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk
0	Check it out
0	This 88243 Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only 1895
0	It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top , before serving
0	The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling
0	The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake
0	The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor
0	It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong
0	The stronger it is the less you use as well
0	The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost
0	This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like
0	One of the best lemon juice that I have tried
0	I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product
0	This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen yearround
0	It has a powerful flavor and you do n't need much of it to zest up a dish
0	Fast delivery and good product
0	This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it 's really handy to have around to add to sauces , dressings , etc
0	Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it , nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with
0	This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice , but it is good
0	It has a slightly odd flavor , perhaps from a preservative
0	Sure wish I could order the frozen juice
0	Could n't believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was
0	Seriously , drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime
0	I like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price
0	This is an great product
0	The taste is great , and it works exactly as described
0	Superb natural sleep aid
0	AMAZING
0	Yes , we 'd probably be better served taking a yoga class , but this is a good second choice
0	This helps you fall asleep and stay asleep
0	The product arrived with 2 broken bottles , which at this price is a 6 loss
0	The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the smallbubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box
0	Big packing fail , but the product is awesome
0	The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned
0	Our friends could n't discern any difference from classic CCCs
0	The texture , body , and elasticity meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other glutenfree flours is nice and chewy   the same as CCCs made with regular flour
0	This is great stuff
0	Made some really tasty banana bread
0	Good quality and lowest price in town
0	This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts
0	I am about to make one for a pie auction at church , after a friend requested that something strawberry should be offered
0	You can make the most amazing and relatively healthy fruit tarts by baking a base , layering it with uncooked , fresh , sliced fruit , then pouring over the madeup contents of one of these packets
0	I 've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes , to hold a fruit topping in place
0	To do this , slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it 's still in the springform pan
0	Pour on the glaze , let it set up and then remove the springform
0	You 'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake
0	Just blindbake the muffin tins lined with pate , then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits berries are great and pour over the glaze
0	The smell is kinda strong , but not bad
0	It 's tolerablel
0	I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants
0	I did n't expect it to taste good , but it actually does
0	
0	The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright
0	There is just a slight vitaminy taste , but it 's not overwhelming
0	It 's also a bit pricey for what you get
0	This coffee is great because it 's all organic ingredients
0	No pesticides to worry about , plus it tastes good , and you have the healing effects for ganoderma
0	Like the other people mentioned , this coffee has a great taste
0	I 've tried different instant coffees before , but this one is one of the better ones
0	Tastes great , and gives me energy without the jitters
0	Love this productbr However , I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a ziplock pouch because the ziplock ripped off and quit working after awhile
0	But the product is fantastic , just not crazy about the packaging
0	These little guys are tasty and refreshingbr br I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath
0	Cheers
0	it 's a real mintbr br Cons none
0	LOLOLOL
0	
0	These mints are really strong and have a great taste
0	They are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse
0	This is a huge supply of them
0	I 'm still working on these and have plenty to spare
0	Much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 711 every time you want a mint
0	These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a ripoff
0	Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares
0	Or how about the cereal ploy , they were filled at the factory but settled in transportbr Can manufacturers be honest in their dealings
0	Also line with felt to keep earrings
0	Perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and LOVE the mints
0	Received as shown
0	The tiny Altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability
0	The packaging is small for convenience , and the Altoids are smaller as well with a square shape , blue hue , and even more delicious taste in my opinion
0	Highly recommended
0	Fresh scent and taste
0	Easy to eat one tin in few hours
0	Hard to find the wintergreen smalls sugar free as stores only have the red smalls peppermint such a common flavor
0	The wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious
0	To me , these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not breath mints
0	They are pleasanttasting little candies in a cute convenient tin , and that 's as far as it goes
0	The mintiness is just not strong , and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis
0	At this point , I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints
0	These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters
0	They loved the Iams
0	After a certain age , we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods and lower carb foods , because the catties were fatties
0	We tried a few types of food
0	Some evinced no change
0	Some made the litter superstink
0	No problems to speak of
0	It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose
0	The cats love it
0	The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing
0	And here 's the kickerbr After feeding the cats Felidae , their demeanor improved
0	Their coats are super soft and lush both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food
0	She 's an older cat , somewhat overweight , and had a grouchy temperament
0	I do n't agree with the previous reviewer that cats do n't like it
0	Clearly , mine does
0	That is what the vet told us ten years ago
0	The youngest is a blob
0	Too much of a good thing
0	By this time , the cats could n't keep it in or down
0	What a mess
0	We 've moved on
0	As with canidae , Felidae has also changed their formula
0	Cats do not like change when it comes to their food
0	And they just had to change it without putting it on their label
0	We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell
0	If cats get upset because of a change in enviorment , or a loud noise they can stop eating
0	It depends on the cat
0	Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight
0	It was n't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick
0	Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it
0	This is just horrible
0	Do n't buy just a few of these
0	I order these by the case
0	I order these olives a lot
0	They are unlike any other olives out there
0	The subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses
0	One of my favorite appetizer treats for guests
0	Hey , the description says 360 grams   that is roughly 13 ounces at under 400 per can
0	No way   that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can
0	At 7 lb
0	in a retail store or a little over 9 with shipping from an online merchant , I think it 's great
0	Most of them were over 30 lb
0	with shipping
0	Has everything I 'm looking for in a strong , fullbodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring
0	I love strong , full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam , irish breakfast or early grey tea , but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging
0	So I have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that was n't bitter at a more palatable price point , and this certainly fits the bill
0	And unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another , ie
0	iced vs hot , this tea is excellent in both forms
0	I would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that does n't cost an arm and leg
0	One reviewer is right , I think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma
0	But this is black tea , and this aroma kind of remind me the ' softness ' of white tea
0	It 's full body like a good cup of Assam , which by no means overpower the delightful , clean taste of Darjeerling , complete with a long lasting note of bergamot
0	I enjoy it best in the evening
0	It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy daybr br For those interested in the specifics I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug , let it steep in 208F water for 23 min , take the infuser out , and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication
0	This is an excellent tea
0	One of the best I have ever had
0	It is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar
0	Herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste
0	It is only for people who like herbal taste
0	I do n't
0	Makes a tasty , super easy meal , fast
0	BUT high in caloriesbr br The instructions say to saute the veggies first but I recommend cooking the chicken first
0	The chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess
0	I made it with snow peas and carrots only
0	I do nt like the little corn
0	Added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice
0	It came out wonderful
0	Dinner on the table in less than 30mins
0	Most have too much sugar or worst , corn syrup
0	This mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty
0	It does have a little kick
0	Enjoy
0	Might be a little spicy for some , but this stuff rocks
0	Took me one or two to get used to the pickle taste
0	But now aim hooked and have to keep a bottle on hand
0	This candy is not as described
0	The middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as describedbr Looks and tastes like it 's way past it 's expiration datebr Would never reccommend this
0	Paid a good chunk of cash for nothing
0	I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste
0	It also has a natural sweetnessbr br The ingredients include Organic WuLi Cliff Oolong Tea 700 mg , Organic Black Tea 600 mg , Organic Green Tea Extract 100 mg , Proprietary blend 600 mg , plus some Ginseng panax , Orange Peel , Lemon Grass , and Guarana
0	Other Ingredients Natual Orange and Citrus flavorsbr br My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee
0	I 'll be coming back to this one
0	just try it on red juicy watermelon , wonderful experience
0	Terrible
0	Artificial lemon taste , like Pledge Lemon Furniture Polish
0	Do n't do this to yourself
0	Just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest
0	These things are huge
0	I love the way the crystals crunch , and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle
0	This lemony flavor is my favoriteit 's good on almost everything
0	How misleading the packaging of the box is
0	The photo on the box I bought these in store makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads expanding the length and width of the box
0	Wrong
0	FAIL
0	Not ecofriendly at allbr br Would I buy these again
0	No   I feel ripped off
0	This is the ultimate puppy food
0	The kibbles are great for small breeds
0	High in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use
0	Less waste results from the high quality ingredients
0	Never have I seen such gas issues
0	Both of them consistently had foul gas
0	Consistently
0	But , they continued to have gas
0	No more farting
0	I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies
0	They just need that in their diet
0	Yeah right , you try dealing with gas for that long
0	Much better
0	Fresh , a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories
0	They taste just like chocolate pudding
0	Each packet of tea weighs 500 grams , which equals 11 pounds or 176 ounces
0	This tea is good mornings , afternoons or evenings
0	I use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot
0	Hi , I have to have black tea everyday
0	Ahmad Tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea
0	Great flavor with no lingering aftertaste
0	I 've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea , with enough aroma and taste , and beautiful reddish color , perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own , but a decent base for mixesbr This tea , however , is nothing of the sort
0	Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell , and the brewed tea is weak , flat and tasteless
0	Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore
0	I love love love this deal   it 's way fun to pick from so many
0	Teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees
0	The other outfits that assemble samplers are boring   they do the choosing , and from a much narrower range
0	The sellers here are very nice , also , and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method it 's easy
0	Who cares
0	good products and fast shipping equals a happy me
0	WOW
0	This product is very impressive
0	I bought the 8 oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging , price and shipping
0	The powder dissolves instantly
0	Even in water
0	This product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries , especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away
0	I definitely will being trying the other flavors soon
0	The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry
0	Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme
0	Five minutes in , one tentacle was bitten off , ball inside cracked in half
0	Not durable enough to be a dog toy
0	Disappointed
0	So is the dog
0	I am chemical sensitive as well as sugarfree
0	Once in a while I drink a full bottle before a workout
0	Compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there I highly recommend this
0	This product is clean and does n't leave nasty chems behind in the body
0	Try it before you judge from a review   everyone 's body reacts differently
0	I paid 399 for this drink
0	Most energy drinks can not be made w out a high dosage of caffeine
0	But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safebr br Now you 're NOT sensitive to caffeine , then it 's a great buy
0	It 's not loaded w sugar
0	The taste is easy and pleasant
0	It 's not loaded w a bunch of chemicals like 5Hour shots or Starbucks drinks
0	And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours
0	These Nature Valley Nut Lovers Variety Pack was perfect
0	Although I was n't sure about the peanut butter bar , it was excellent
0	Quick shipping and very fresh
0	It reeks like a chemical rubber smell
0	This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid
0	Unbelievable
0	The product is faulty
0	Period
0	I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership
0	The flavor is fantastic
0	However , they do not supply a gallonsized tub , and Dr Mercola has the best product in that size category
0	Also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs
0	Stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking , too
0	Good product , good value
0	A great healthy product
0	I really enjoy this product
0	I had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store
0	Thanks so much
0	My most recent purchase , however , was disappointing
0	The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 14th of the regular size
0	Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw
0	It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes
0	They have had many complaints of a similar nature
0	This , they claimed , also reduced the crystal size
0	They said this problem should go away with their newer crop
0	The representative said that the newcrop sugar will have a 610 digit date code without ANY spaces that ends with a 1 and no letters
0	The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar
0	My recent badpurchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a 51A
0	Bottom line their current product is not much better than much cheaper products
0	Love this sugar
0	Recommend
0	Product is exactly as advertised
0	What a savings
0	At least half the retail price
0	Easy to store because of the individual packaging
0	I do not eat much sugar , but still
0	This sugar is called turbinado sugar , but is misleading
0	I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass
0	What a shame on the producer
0	It 's just sugar in the raw , it 's flavor profile is much better then white sugar and it 's suppose to be better for you or something
0	I just wish the bags were resealable
0	This is a delicious sugar
0	It has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma
0	But the granules are quite big , however   bigger than plain refined sugar
0	This makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together
0	It would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer
0	I only use raw sugar , it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good
0	Will buy again
0	This sugar is very good
0	My only complaint is the price
0	I loved the higher molasses content Sugar in the Raw
0	I really love this sugar and pricewise it 's much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else
0	Love this sugar
0	It tastes so much better and is n't as overly sweet tasting as regular sugar
0	The price that Amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff
0	Ca n't say anything bad about Sugar in the Raw
0	I like it better than the other natural sugars
0	Better consistency and   I know it does n't matter   but better color
0	Unfortunately , one of the natural paper bags got torn a bit in the box
0	Great service
0	Items arrived faster than expected
0	Very efficient
0	Will use this seller again
0	I highly recommend this seller
0	Thank you for the excellent service
0	Please ignore the onestar comments , if you check the bag the main ingredient IS in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower
0	With anything that is gluten free you have to add another binder which is where the corn flour comes in
0	For someone who has celiac disease and can not have Sunchips , because they contain wheat a key binder to any chip , cookie or cereal this is an excellent product
0	Best flavor ever
0	I 'm addicted
0	They are all good but these are by far the best
0	I could live on these
0	And there is no need for anymore to say
0	So many healthy products do n't taste very good
0	The only problem is I can eat the entire bag in one sitting
0	I give these crisps a big thumbs up
0	This is one of the best tasting crisps I have ever eaten
0	The name is deceptive   these have Masa corn flour listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste
0	Ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird tin can taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever
0	For some reason this product does n't have that
0	I also make indian dishes with this , and spicey spaghetti sauce
0	the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores
0	dissapointing
0	howdy y'all , br br the actual product is VERY good   i 'd rate the item a 4 on it 's own
0	br br For comparison , I 'm comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa
0	I used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though
0	This is a fantastic product , and I wish it was readily available in most stores
0	It 's taste is not the greatest , but it 's a 25 oz
0	shot , and it 's gone in a second
0	It tastes , more or less , like a concentrated sweet tea
0	I will put up the taste for the results
0	It 's got 150 mg of caffeine , which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters
0	I ca n't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes , and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it
0	The sugar is at 9 g , which is n't horrible
0	I used to drink 4 16 oz
0	It worked well , but gave me a jittery feeling , almost headachy but not quite
0	And the price is ok , on Amazon anyway
0	It 's all about me feeling good
0	Good stuff
0	I like this products because it is more natural then the others
0	Plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work
0	Great value
0	This one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better
0	Especially on the turnpikes where it 's just way too expensive
0	It 's worth the   per shot
0	My husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost
0	I would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there
0	I 'll be ordering again soon for sure
0	I purchased it because it was on sale
0	In terms of the energy it provides , it works , but the taste leaves something to be desired
0	I tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable
0	As a software engineer , this is entirely unacceptable
0	The energy shot truly does work
0	I always have some water handy as a chaserwhich helps
0	Yay
0	
0	This is my favorite in terms of taste and effect
0	Plus , it 's somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used
0	If you 're looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals , this is a great option
0	The taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters
0	I fell in love instantly
0	The drink is delicious   I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice , like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea
0	The rush it gives me is slow and even
0	I love it
0	It has no sugar high   no crash
0	The price is very good
0	I 've seen it over 2 bucks in the store
0	Products takes pretty good , and it does n't leave you gittery
0	With subscibe and save as well as Prime membership I pay below   2 a shot
0	I do not get jittery or crash
0	It also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant
0	The most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well , or perhaps I 'm getting more used to it
0	I do n't drink it for the flavor , but it 's not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other , nonorganic energy shots
0	This is the first time I 've really been misled by other reviews on amazon
0	Boy am I sorry
0	And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards
0	8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it
0	Unless you really like things that taste of a weird teaflavored cough syrup and do n't work , do n't buy this
0	I do n't know what to do with the other 11 bottles
0	big fail
0	I loved this mold
0	But there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that
0	It served it 's main purpose
0	The regular chocolate ones are good , but THESE are the BEST EVER
0	
0	Try this you might like it
0	The price is really good and well worth the purchase
0	I will be back for more
0	This tricolor couscous is really goodfull of flavor and fun to eat
0	I love the texture
0	I cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs parsley , cilantro , along with some red pepper flakes
0	At the end of cooking , I add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dishHighly recommend
0	I tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck
0	It is so goodadd a few herbs and it 's a great side dish , or add more and make a pasta type saladso very good
0	I am hooked
0	Great flavor and so easy to prepare
0	The package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions
0	It was mushy and tastelessWe have thrown out the rest of the container
0	How can I compare other items online or in a store
0	Sometimes with flavored coffees , the smell is there but the taste is n't
0	However , not with this one
0	I 'm now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try
0	I love this coffee
0	But it 's worth it
0	Many flavored coffees I 've tried only seem to have a flavored odor that does n't reach the coffee , but this one manages both
0	I 've been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it
0	It 's a no brainer
0	It is hot
0	I love it , tasty and a little sweet
0	I usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot , but this one lives up to its billing
0	It 's hot enough that people who are n't used to it will say That 's hot
0	br br Flavor bright and forward
0	This salsa is much brighter in the mouth
0	To get a good deal you have to watch for sales
0	Love this product
0	Fast shipping , as usual
0	Would buy again
0	These individually wrapped pieces are delicious although I wish there were a few more
0	Mildly sweet with no sugarfree aftertaste , even a traditional marzipanaholic should enjoy these
0	I was amazed at how quickly it arrived
0	It is a cute stocking stuffer , but only OK as far as user appeal
0	Toy was typical quality I expected
0	I got taken for a major ride on the shipping
0	So we cancelled the order
0	It was cancelled without any problem
0	That is a positive note
0	i love the convenience of the singles
0	The best creamer aroundTaste is just like the big bottle
0	These creamers come in 4 packs of 25
0	I have taken one to work and opened one for home so far , and have n't found a single broken or leaking creamer yet
0	We had no problem with the shipment , but the creamer itself is thinner than International Delight
0	Other than that we are happy D
0	Besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers , I liked this item specifically because of packaging
0	The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each as shown in the photo those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes
0	Thus , none of my cups were broken , no waste and no sloppy drippy mess
0	As a bonus , the auto delivery price is very reasonable
0	This seller is very nice
0	And the price is very good
0	I purchased these coffee mate singles to use at work along with the coffee tea bags
0	I received the items in a timely manner
0	Upon receipt , I removed a pack to consume
0	The poptart was STALE and left an awful taste in my mouth
0	Fantastic for after school snacks , lunch boxes , and school treats
0	The only challenge is finding more in stores
0	Way to go Kellogg 's   fantastic product
0	Yes , I am having a cup right now
0	Highly recommend
0	Taste like it is stale
0	Will not order this again
0	This stuff tasted NOTHING , like the Douwe Egberts at the hall
0	This is possibly stale coffee
0	Serveice delivery with the seller was excellent
0	The product was not
0	Will not order again
0	Bad taste
0	Iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes
0	This is honestly THE BEST seasoning salt in all the land
0	It tightens up any dish not spicy , just perfectly seasoned
0	It 's perfect , hence , my purchase of this 35 oz
0	mamma jamma
0	The order arrived as advertised
0	I have had only a few chances to use it , but it is awesome
0	The flavor is exactly what I hoped for
0	I like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly
0	Great quality , flavor and aroma
0	Ca n't beat that its organic
0	I would n't hesitate to buy this again
0	I have a slightly different version of this   different brand
0	That works pretty well
0	What a GREAT idea
0	br Absolutely recommend it
0	This product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned
0	It worked great for this , as well as for the food
0	I did n't like bananas in it thoughimpossible to get clean
0	The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out
0	Granted , some foods are more difficult than others and some do n't cause that much of a problem
0	The Munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product , it 's kind of like sucking on food through a cloth
0	This product is amazing
0	Super easy to clean and use
0	When ordering these , I was under the impression that there were 2 per packageFYIthey're not
0	Only one per
0	I literally had to hide the box to the wedding
0	It was a great tasting product for the lowest price I 've seen
0	These are delicious
0	The chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose
0	Crunchy and not bitter
0	a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB00067AD4UChocolate Covered Espresso Beans 5 Poundsa
0	The product was exactly as advertised and fresh
0	We need to reorder to keep up with demand
0	These chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful
0	The chocolate is very dark and rich and the bean inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing
0	Popchips are so good
0	These Popchips are my salty crunchy indulgence
0	They taste so good ,
0	I 've purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix which is a great product , by the way
0	This is the highest price I 've seen
0	For a twopack they should be charging 20 or less
0	What gives
0	The Sugar was sweet , that can not be denied
0	As advertised , It did n't melt when baked either
0	However , it will not do for your Liege WafflesGaufres what the larger pebbles of Belgian pearl will do
0	These grains are smaller , think pretzel salt , or seed pearls
0	That 's exactly what I was looking for to bake some chouquettes puffs with small sugar pearls on top
0	Works great , yum
0	
0	This is what I was looking for and was missing it
0	Definitely recommend it
0	A common problem in some fruit wines
0	br br This is , indeed , good strawberry flavor
0	Great stuff and dependable , especially when there are a million brands out there to choose from
0	I love the stuff
0	But I buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again
0	No bite , no after taste , a little pricy but still worth it
0	No worse price wise than starbucks or peets
0	Will keep running through the list here and see what happens
0	Love them all so far
0	The taste is clean and strong , the ethos is correct organic , baby and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate
0	Be still my caffeinated heart
0	Er , Weaver 's
0	A very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream andor honey
0	Definately not my cup of coffee
0	Oh , did i say it was bitter
0	I m learning that Latin American and South American coffees have this distinct coffee caramelish finish

0	These are my favorite bars ever
0	The combo of raisons and dark choc is wonderful
0	Very filling
0	These are hard to find in the stores
0	I 'm thankful for subsrcibe and save
0	Chocolate , peanuts and raisinsit does n't get any better
0	Hard to get husband to eat breakfast before school
0	He takes two bars now and is very happy to do so
0	It is often hard to find flavor in local grocery stores
0	So again , Amazoncom came through with a reasonable price
0	I often like to have a bar in the evening as a night snack
0	I was suprised that it was a single box
0	every time I ordered before it was a 2 pack
0	My fault for not reading closer
0	I will not order any more at this price for 1 24 count
0	Almost
0	Very smooth flavor
0	Not too strong and not too weak
0	This soup is just so full bodied , and is seasoned just right
0	Oh my gosh , is this good
0	Then Hubby brought a jar of this home
0	The tomato flavor is amazing
0	I will never buy store ketchup every again
0	Sir Kensington 's did a great job of updating the classic ketchup with this wonderful product
0	This is ridiculous
0	The best gourmet ketchup I have ever tasted
0	It is pricey , but wowlove this stuff
0	It would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup
0	Yummy
0	The tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor
0	It is clean and really fresh
0	Perfect on an avocado chicken sandwichbr br The spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup I have ever tried
0	The spicy version of this ketchup is n't bad , but it is too expensive
0	The regular version is sweet as dessert
0	Horrible
0	Annie 's Organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less
0	Even Heinz organic is a better deal
0	I gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass , not plastic
0	These condiments are overpriced and terrible
0	The classic is disgustingly sweet
0	The spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant
0	I was pretty pleased with these mushrooms
0	They were mostly large pieces , rehydrated well and had good flavor
0	I 'd estimate about 25 of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces , most likely due to the shaking about in transit
0	Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes
0	There was a small amount perhaps an ounce or so of very smallmincedsizedustlike pieces
0	Still useful to add into gravies and the like
0	Nothing gets wastedbr br The label says it is a product of China and Italy
0	Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each countrybr br I 'm quite fond of dried mushrooms
0	Really helps meld all the flavors together
0	I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta
0	Highly recommend
0	Much larger than cocktail peanuts
0	
0	The cashews were nice and big , with the vast majority being whole
0	There were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag , but that 's pretty expected with so many cashews
0	Although there were several shriveled ones , they taste just fine
0	I ordered these after a fair bit of searching online   even ordering the smaller 13 oz bags
0	The cashews were fresh and whole   with like 10 broken pieces
0	These nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty
0	They are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can
0	Plus , he likes nuts , pecans , almonds peanuts
0	He loved these
0	ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST
0	
0	Got this free with another order I placed
0	I could n't believe how much the cats loved it
0	I will buy again for sure
0	This is a great ham soup base
0	Great flavor
0	I have n't used the ham base
0	It is loaded with MSG
0	This is a great all around mix that is very good with a wonderful texture
0	Thanks again amazon
0	It tastes great , cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make
0	Although it can be made using water , I think it 's better made with milk
0	I love it with pure organic maple syrup
0	The pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my son 's egg allergy
0	It 's also great for camping or any time you 'd like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available
0	HEY
0	These are GREAT Waffles and Pancakes
0	We have to add 50 more mix , tho , as the recipies on the bag are VERY thin
0	This mix is 70 ORGANIC , too
0	Customer sevice took care of the problem however it was a foolish way to ship the product
0	This mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping
0	Nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box
0	3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top
0	There were no tears in the packages
0	Just awful
0	I thought food was supposed to taste good
0	Perhaps the worst bottle of wine I 've ever had
0	It is thin , no body , and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot
0	The taste is just bitter   not the complexity that I expect from a pinot noir of any price
0	Just not what I 'm looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir
0	Maybe my bottle was n't sealed well and went to vinegar   other reviews for this wine are favorable
0	A good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition
0	Everyone get the munchiesis this is a good alternative to eating potato chips
0	This is a wonderful warm flavored tea , especially now in colder weatherbr This tea has a sweet , soothing chamomile fragrance
0	This is one of the best mint chocolate syrup I 've ever had so far
0	The others pale in flavor by comparison
0	There are only seven ingredients in this sauce , including organic natural mint flavor
0	There are only 110 calories
0	This is a simple product and it is simply good
0	It is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup , so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out
0	This will be great for people who like mint , it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate
0	Sometimes simple is better
0	A grande item
0	Delicious fish with the ultimate flavor , best ever in a can for all purposes
0	The Raincoast Trading Co salmon is very tasty , equally as good quality salmon as the Kirkland
0	However , the Raincoast arrived in perfect condition , the Kirkland cans were dented badly
0	I recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon
0	This tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an Indian restaurant
0	It 's much better than getting a teabag and making it the English way , with a lot of water and a bit of milk
0	This is very creamy and tasty
0	My only criticism is that there are n't enough sachets in the box
0	Only 10
0	That means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea
0	But it 's a delicious afterdinner drink
0	I would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box
0	i love this product ca nt find it locally
0	This is the best way to cook a roast
0	Please continue to keep this product available
0	It 's always a pleasure to find French 's products on the web
0	These are the best
0	Side note shipping was very slow , but maybe your chances will be better
0	But out of the can ready mix with a little salt , pepper , spinach , and some cheese and it 's a great easy meal
0	The thing about Marmite is that those who do n't like it hate it , and those who love it ca n't live without it
0	It 's very much an English thing and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor as in Victoria Beckham is Marmite meaning that those who do n't like heretc
0	Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price
0	Good job , Amazon
0	A vile , miserable pancake
0	I do n't know if it was their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste
0	Only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix
0	The buttermilk , baking soda SLS and sea salt are not
0	This one went straight into the garbage
0	What s there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie
0	Hope these do n't go the way of the dinosaur
0	These arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap
0	The cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients
0	The chips are real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing
0	These are truly great cookies
0	That 's what I heard , at least , from an admittedly unreliable person
0	Extremely dry and hard
0	These chips have a great loaded potato flavor , which are flavorful
0	I like the sweet onion chips better , but these are also at the top of the list for greattasting potato chips
0	Kettle chips are great chips fthe money
0	I buy mostly for vending , so the size of the bag is important
0	Kettle 's 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full
0	Salt   Vinegar flavor is satisfying , about an 8 out of 10
0	Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full
0	It 's hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well
0	Sometimes they are too wide
0	or too plump with air
0	Bag size is good
0	BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10
0	There 's only a slight taste of jalapeno , and they are delicious
0	See you at addicts anonymous
0	The title says it all
0	Great flavor , hint of spice , excellent crunch
0	
0	WOW
0	I now have a FAVORITE
0	If you like onions , this is a MUST buy
0	The flavor is GREAT
0	The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in
0	I love that these are n't filled with nasty chemicals
0	While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better
0	The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches , or handing out in gift bags , even just for portion control
0	Now , I have n't done a sidebyside comparison , but these chips still taste like the real deal
0	These snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store I work for
0	Portion control AND reduced fat
0	Yes , please
0	With the Subscribe   Save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store
0	I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon 11 WHAT
0	These chips are thick and crunchy
0	The taste is perfect
0	I enjoy these chips
0	I think those are better but only slightly , like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering
0	The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag
0	The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags
0	The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor
0	These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I 've had
0	These are my favorite glutenfree dairyfree flavored chips
0	Many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so it 's nice to find ones that I can eat
0	The vinegar flavor is really intense and good
0	The ingredients listed include garlic powder , onion powder , parsley , jalapeno , and spices
0	I 'm not sure what other spices there are , but it sure tastes like lemongrass to meyum
0	These chips are thick cut and very crunch
0	They come in a seriously heavyduty bag
0	The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic
0	I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it
0	Sure enough , there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions tear here
0	So easy
0	Why did n't I think of that
0	The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese presumably some folks like this
0	They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods
0	The flavors are pure and real
0	They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive
0	Salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip
0	I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste
0	Just set a limit of 1 bagbr br Consbr As another reviewer said , there 's a lot of oil in them chips
0	Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off
0	It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off , but it 's true
0	And at least this way , you 'll get rid of some of the oil
0	These are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many , a handful or two does the trick
0	Very crisp and savory
0	On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase
0	The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven
0	Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain
0	This is n't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and does n't ruin the bag at allbr br Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic
0	Tried many varieties of BBQ chips and hands down these are the BEST on the market
0	These R not too salty or greasy
0	Great crispy crunch
0	Plenty of good BBQ flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of
0	Every bag after bag is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st
0	
0	Kettle chis are the best ever
0	These chips have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste
0	Chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning
0	I like the 2 oz size bags , just the right amount of chips
0	The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh   no chip clip neededbr br The only problem
0	Definitely have to hide the case from the kids
0	OK , I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful
0	I love the crunch , the color , NO TRANS FAT
0	This was the best deal ever
0	The delivery was fast , the chips are delicious and very fresh
0	Love it
0	Personally I think the flavor is perfect
0	Try them for yourself
0	The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect
0	Just spicy enough , a hint of sweetness , just a little smokey
0	The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial , but not hard
0	This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers , hot dogs or brats , chicken or just about any casual entree
0	I 've found that going beyond the simplyflavored chips , like cheddar or vinegar , usually results in disappointment
0	The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate
0	The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chipsweet , salty , spicy
0	Was sour in there too
0	I do n't know , but this is a wellmade wellbalanced chip that is addicting
0	Rich taste and flavor
0	Almost impossible not to finish the entire bagThe true meaning of decadence
0	These are certainly my favorite chips
0	Oh , I love these chips
0	Great that these are so cheap here at Amazon
0	I LOVE these chips
0	It is a little weird to review potato chips
0	But these chips are great
0	The crunch is just right , plus they have just the right amount of salt
0	Not to salty not too bland
0	They are a little oily but that 's ok
0	The best thing is the 2 oz package
0	This 2 oz package allows for a little portion control
0	Be sure to use your scissors to open , 'cause these chips are packaged for freshness and do n't open easily
0	Enjoy
0	Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors
0	All in all , its good to have choiceAmazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice
0	these chips are good , and bad , and create moral dilemmas constantly
0	BEWARE
0	Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss
0	Some of their flavors are terrible
0	But this is very simple and delicious
0	Probably one of their best flavorsbr br Pros Thick , crunchy potato chips with light salt that does n't compromise on taste , ecofriendly business that is n't just giving us lip servicebr br Cons The occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open
0	Use scissors instead
0	They are a bit spicy , but nothing overpowering
0	Just lots of crunchy , sweet , spicy goodness
0	It 's crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt
0	Just perfect
0	But this one
0	I just keep on eating
0	These are some of the best chips that I have ever had
0	They are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time
0	Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands
0	Kettle Brand chips do n't have trans fats , MSG or artificial flavors and colorings
0	These chips are spicy , so you would want to select a semisweet white wine
0	Also , a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger , lime , garlic and cilantro without overpowering them
0	Classically , a Germanstyle Riesling fits these parameters perfectly
0	These Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty , tangy , sweet and crunchy
0	Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands

0	Also , a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger , lime , garlic and cilantro without overpowering them
0	Classically , a Germanstyle Riesling fits these parameters perfectly
0	I have to use a knife or scissors everytime
0	These are delicious
0	The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches , definitely more than a serving
0	I recently tried this flavorbrand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are
0	I am a little disappointed that there are not , so far , very many brown chips in these bags , but the flavor is still very good
0	They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag
0	Chips are never crushed or broken , always fresh
0	We really liked this brandflavor of chips
0	Very tasty
0	These chips are some of the best I 've tasted
0	They are not filled with chemicals
0	You taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato
0	Not greasy
0	Perfectly crispy
0	If you do n't like salt and vinegar tanginess , do n't even bother to try
0	These definitely have zip
0	These chips were a great deal
0	Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips
0	Shipping was very fast , sooner than expected
0	Eat at your own risk
0	Good and salty
0	Great buy and arrived quick and packed great
0	I love brown russet , hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee
0	  My experience with a lot of cheesefavored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side
0	Bought this box of chips as a Father 's Day gift because Dad loves them
0	They are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips
0	These chips are quite tasty and the price is right
0	Packaged very well , would buy again
0	So I do n't know why these were differentbr Will never buy these chips from here again
0	They are very good chips
0	Amazon should rethink the shipping to Alaska thing
0	I would order groceries online
0	My husband likes these a lot
0	Not bad , though
0	Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health
0	They do have about 12 the calories in fat , however
0	Just got this order and it is ok A bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me , if it is there
0	There is very little sour cream or onion flavor
0	Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning
0	The flavoring included Parmesan , Cheddar , Blue Cheese , garlic and other spices
0	As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get
0	These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming
0	The flavoring included garlic , ginger , jalapeno , cilantro and other spices , and it just felt great to eat these
0	I will buy these again
0	These were a treat
0	I agree with the other review , these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums
0	The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the saltvinegar combo
0	Unfortunately , every bag I received in that case was over cooked
0	They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag
0	They definitely need to improve that
0	We have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery
0	
0	
0	
0	and I do not even like kettle chips
0	For the most part , I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy , but the flavor of these chips is amazing
0	The are the type of hot that is refreshing
0	If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things
0	
0	
0	These are the best potato chips I 've ever tasted
0	It 's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping
0	The texturecrunchiness is just perfect , as is the salt and vinegar combination
0	And , judging from the nutrition facts , they seem to be healthier , too
0	they are really amazing
0	i love cheddar too , but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor
0	This is easily the best potato chip that I have ever had
0	Look at the ingredients Ginger and 3 types of hot pepper
0	They have that hotwithahintofsweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of Thai food
0	Since these are kettlecooked , the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit overbrowned
0	The flavor is tremendous , although I would n't describe it as Thai
0	It 's more of a vague , sweet and tangy flavor with a kick , and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger
0	The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher 's snack cupboard
0	That makes them an indulgence thatbr rescues some people from overindulgence
0	Every flavor is dynamite
0	And they 're healthy
0	Enjoy , and do n't eat them too fast
0	Wo n't order this brand again
0	Great chips otherwise
0	Perfect
0	These chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip , but whose taste buds do n't appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor
0	The only thing I REALLY dislike about these chips along with the rest of the flavors is that the serving size is HALF the bag
0	Really
0	Who can eat half and save the rest for later
0	Not me
0	These are a favorite at our home
0	These are not ruffly chips that have ridges
0	These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes
0	They also have a great taste
0	These are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many
0	They have the best potato flavor
0	Great chips , great price
0	They are spectacular with deli sandwiches or on their own
0	Mmmmm vinegar
0	Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot
0	And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful
0	It tastes like rancid milk
0	Not just sour , but like sour cream that when rancid
0	The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing
0	I basically hated these chips
0	Hopefully they 'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips
0	Kettle chips now look , feel and taste like Lays
0	These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty
0	Now , no longer my favorite
0	Great price for an excellent chip
0	At about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip
0	The chips taste great , and packages were all sealed and in good condition when the arrived
0	The box on the other hand was in tatters , with holes and complely squished
0	I do n't know if that was a result of customs or the voyage , but to receive it was a bit disgruntling given it was falling apart
0	Luckily , there were no victims within
0	All the chips are as they should be
0	Not my taste
0	Make sure you like salt   vinegar before ordering
0	I 'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips
0	TOTALLY ORGASMIC
0	these chips are the best spicy chip i have ever tasted
0	signed up for the subscribe and save option
0	the case contained 15FIFTEEN , FULL SIZED BAGS OF CHIPS
0	the price per unit equals 173 per package
0	that is not even the cost of plain chips
0	if you add the free shipping and the fast delivery , this deal is a steal
0	ps
0	ENJOY
0	Seriously , now
0	Tasty , tasty , tasty
0	Fresh , toobr br The only problem is that you have a pack of 24 and that can lend itself to wanting to make multiple trips to the cupboard for more helpings
0	Or , grabbing multiple bags to begin with
0	Pace yourself
0	It 's really a good size for an adultbr br It 's a somewhat healthier snack than a typical bag of fried chips , but it has 300 calories per bag
0	Again , not too bad , but something to think aboutbr br Bottomline Delicious
0	Despite coming in an extremely large box , I found this to be great value
0	All the bags were preserved with a reasonable expiration date that is months away
0	I 'd definitely recommend
0	Give me pain chips any day
0	Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips
0	They 're also crunchy , as kettlecooked chips should be
0	THOSE are awesome
0	Being a saltfree product is why I purchased this , but the chips are quite greasy
0	These are the best potato chips that money can buy
0	There is just enough salt to taste it , but not so much that it masks the lingering potatoey awesomeness after you 've wolfed down a bag of these beauties
0	I may never eat anything else again
0	These things are just too darn cheesy
0	Otherwise , you will overdose on their cheddary goodness
0	I tried to create an original line to describe this palatepleasing taste treat , but could n't beat what the manufacturer said tonguepuckering tang and crunch
0	For the sake of fewer calories , I try hard and have succeeded so far
0	You do n't need salt to hide the taste of potato chips
0	And these chips prove it
0	The taste of the potato comes through , instead of being masked
0	They are not actually burned
0	It has something to do with how much sugar is in the potato that makes it dark
0	These are the best of the best
0	I have tried a lot of SV chips and these are the best
0	Real sea salt and REAL vinegar
0	Mouthwatering flavor   crispiness
0	Not for the faint of heart   the flavor is very authentic
0	
0	Kettle brand chips are very crunchy
0	I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the soft end of the softcrunchy spectrum
0	Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest , but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy
0	Otherwise , you 'll love these chips
0	The Sea Salt   Vinegar chips are super TANGY
0	I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time
0	Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt   Vinegar has a gourmet flavor
0	The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy
0	I do n't know how else to put it
0	I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product
0	Did I just get a weird batch
0	Well the next bag was good
0	So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle
0	Acquire company with high quality brand recognition , sell product to mass merchants , lower qualitycost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand
0	increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors
0	Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand
0	Truly delicious
0	These Backyard BBQ Kettle Chips were a great deal with the promo code
0	It was nice to have a larger size bag
0	Great flavor and All Natural
0	Total calories is 300 for 2 ounce bag
0	This is slightly on the higher side
0	But still it is ok , as they have not compromised on the tastebr br Only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips , which taste bad
0	Kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are therebr br Thanks to Amazon to get 24 bags for just 12 bucks with free shipping using their coupon
0	Chips are not as tangy as I hoped or expected
0	Poore Brothers is a better choice for the hardcore Salt N Vinegar fans
0	These bags had a lot of overcooked brown pieces
0	also felt very greasy
0	Had to keep wiping my fingers on a napkin
0	Got these Kettle Chips Sea Salt   Vinegar 15 5 oz bags and was not impressed
0	Tasted kind of flat
0	Some bags had multiple holes
0	One bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it
0	So much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired
0	Martin
0	But without any of the associated wardrobe risks
0	  HIGHLY recommended
0	Hard rather than crispy , are much thinner than they used to be and lacking any flavour , a real shame
0	completely plain and gross
0	how does this even happen
0	Amazon , in it 's deep wisdom , has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE , and other brands of
0	potato chips , TOGETHERbr br Of course , this DOES have SOME advantages , because most potatochip lovers , like me
0	, enjoy eating several flavour , and brand varieties
0	So , comparisons can be made easily
0	At least they are in the oneounce bagshopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same
0	These are definitely chips for ADULTS , however   andor children whose strongerthanadult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips
0	br br The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS , in the 1ounce bags , and hopefully , in the 9 ounce bags as well , is as followsbr br Potatoesbr Vegetable Oil , Safflower and Sunflower Oil , br Honey Powder , Dried cane sugar , honey , br Rice Powderbr Sugarbr Saltbr Onion Powderbr Tomato Powderbr Paprikabr Torula Yeastbr Garlic Powderbr Chili Pepperbr Citric Acidbr Cayenne Pepperbr Paprika Oleoresin , Colourbr Natural Smoke Flavourbr br Naturally cooked , natural ingredients
0	The combination is a true taste treatbr br Of course , as with all ptato chips , moderation is the keybr Potatoes contain a LOT of potassiumwhich gives energy and othr good thingsbut too much of which can damage kindneys
0	The vegetable oil is great   but too much oil , as well as too much starch , from the potatoes , can hurt the eyes
0	Natural smoke flavour is SO yummybut it , as well as sugar , has   in very large amounts   been linked to cancer productionbr br As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go , thisbr can be ameliorated , a bit , by drinking TEAwhich is good for the eyes
0	  br br These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE , br are totally scrumptious
0	These chips are okay
0	Personally , I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange
0	Keeps you from eating too many
0	Unedible
0	Beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case , not expired but stale and unedible just the same
0	These chips are VERY GOOD
0	Kettle Brand chips used to be so goodoily , crunchy , flavorful
0	I suspect the company has been bought out and the recipe has been changed for the worse
0	Now they 're no better than any other big name brand chip
0	Try the Good Health Kettle Style Olive Oil chips instead
0	RIP , Kettle Brand chips
0	
0	you can absolutely forget about these
0	Confirmed by other reviewers , these chips are now total garbage
0	Like chewing on styrofoam packaging peanuts
0	Positively awful , no hyperbole or exaggeration
0	From a reportedly once great premium brand , literally any mass market chip I 've ever tried tastes better than these
0	Stale and rancid tasting , and virtually no salty taste whatsoever
0	Completely awful
0	These chips are nasty
0	I thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag , no the chips were just soaked with grease
0	Nasty
0	
0	The brown chips are especially bad , besides being salty and sour , they also taste overcooked and burnt
0	But normal people , please do not try this at home
0	I have no argument on this
0	But the point is that more than 50 in the bag is overfried and in brown color
0	I really suffer eating the overfried chips
0	I open some other bags and it looks like the same
0	But for sure I will never buy this brand any more
0	Have not found baked no salt potato chips anywhere
0	If there are any I wish someone would post
0	These are better in England
0	I do n't know why
0	Maybe it 's just nostalgia on my part
0	However , many , many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil
0	I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands
0	It was very unappetizing , and who wants all that oil
0	Very mild in comparison to many others
0	The best of the best are HEB storebrand and World Market
0	Bob 's and Zapp 's Are n't bad
0	These chips are greasy and taste burntthere is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it especially at the bottom of the bag
0	I bought a case of these , and a case of the cheddar and sour cream
0	Both cases ended up in the garbage can
0	Kettle 's are darkburnt , more broken bits , taste greasyoily and not the light crunch
0	Oh well
0	Too strong sour taste and even when you open the bag , the sour smell is too strong
0	I do n't like it
0	Unless you really really really like vinegar   AVOID
0	Those chips should have been called Vinegar and Sea Salt   not Sea Salt and Vinegar
0	I would definitely make the purchase again
0	Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time
0	Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage , a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label yeast extract
0	The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancidbr br What a shame , no more kettle chips for me
0	It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method
0	Do nt be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore
0	The chips were greatfor the first few bags
0	However , after the first bag or two , I noticed that the remaining bags were damaged
0	There were holes in each bag and black , sticky stains on the outside
0	But someone somewhere screwed up
0	These chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag
0	Now
0	It 's like a game of roulette
0	Do n't know if it is still in the box , but it is outside on the porch
0	The outside Amazon box was intact , so it had to be either from the Kettle Chips people or the Amazon warehouse , do n't know which
0	Kettle Chips are the best potato chip God has ever invented
0	Get your life back   with Kettle Chips
0	My daughter that has autism craves hot , spice and pungent foods
0	These are her absolute favorite chips
0	I am a great fan of potato chips and of Thai food
0	What a concept These chips are spicy enough , without burning a hole in your tongue
0	Once in a while , this is a treat definitely worth indulging in
0	Terrible
0	I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box , gross
0	And the box is filled with grease stains
0	Idk if it was from the airplane ride all the way here , but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper
0	I 'm very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers can not enjoy now
0	No worries here
0	All bags are in great shape and expiration dates are n't until June
0	Chips , at least from the first bag , taste like they are supposed to and all is good in the world
0	By the way , fifteen bags for under thirty dollars is a ton less expensive than the going price around here at the local grocery store so , yay team
0	I want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then
0	But , after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips , these just do n't hit the spot for me
0	The box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs
0	Most of the bags survived in tact
0	These chips taste awesome
0	And unlike most other flavored chips , they actually make sure that plenty of the flavory salty goodness gets on each individual chip
0	Just do n't pass gas near any pretty ladies after consumption
0	With Kettle Chips , you really have to be careful
0	Some of their flavors are nauseating
0	Thick cuts of potato , fried to a dark golden brown
0	They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt
0	I ca n't recommend these chips enough
0	During cooking , the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize , creating chips from light gold to a deep amber
0	The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors , and an artisanal display in every bagbr br Some have also said that these chips are oily , which is true
0	Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way
0	That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being usedbr br You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor
0	I 'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips
0	Period
0	These are among the best chips I have ever eaten
0	I was hooked
0	br br You get a pretty big box , filled with 12 bags of these delicious morsels
0	You 've got to stick with this blue bag of chips
0	Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands
0	Kettle Brand chips do n't have trans fats , MSG or artificial flavors and colorings
0	These chips are spicy , so you would want to select a semisweet white wine
0	Also , a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger , lime , garlic and cilantro without overpowering them
0	Classically , a Germanstyle Riesling fits these parameters perfectly
0	Nice crispy thick chips
0	They are just like regular potatoe chips
0	
0	I 've found a new taste treat
0	The processing   ingredients list is actually pretty goodno trans fats , etc
0	So , if you want an indulgence , these are A
0	They are much more flavorful
0	Never had a honeydijon potato chip before
0	Incredibly good   a flavorful combination of sweet , tangy , salty
0	Also not overly hot or spicy
0	Excellentbr br If you want a snack , have something REALLY good
0	It 's got to be worth the caloriesand these are
0	This is a real good productI love these chips and so does my customers ca n't go wrong wit these the best
0	These are the only chips I eat
0	I do n't know what to say that others have not covered
0	Only 5 mg sodium per serving , chips are crisp
0	I sometimes will dip in a low salt ketchup and that adds a bit to the flavor
0	They are crisp and tasty without all of the salt
0	First off , these chips are not super spicy
0	They actually taste sort of sweet at first , with many degrees of flavor
0	The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards
0	I 'd say these are definitely a good , unique chip
0	Smiles
0	I almost gave up on finding a potato chip like this
0	It 's slightly hardcrunchy , but not a problem at all
0	I would just prefer it to be softer
0	Kettle if you do make that happen , please keep everything else the same
0	Thank you
0	In a way , they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen , but with a kick
0	For me , how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger
0	Because this is a case purchase , I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case
0	The 2 oz size seems to be no longer available , which is a shame I can eat the entire 5 oz bag
0	These are by far the best
0	They seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste
0	Package arrived DOUBLE boxed , wrapped , and the inside boxthat holds the goods perfect not a single dent or rough mark , outstanding packagingbr br The Productbr br These are the best chips on the planet , Salt ' N Vinegar flavor is beyond among the best chips I 've ever had
0	But try it againbr br Not to mention , this particular flavor has held up in numerous surveys and comparisons against other manufactures
0	than many other chips , as one peruses the dietary informationbr br Second , individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at thembr br Third , the jalapeno has some kick not overly hot , of course
0	Too many products labelled as spicy are not , have no kick , and are as bland as can be
0	Here , you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno
0	My preference
0	A bit more heat
0	
0	
0	
0	After looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box , I had to write a review
0	The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag
0	Thanks for a great tasting product , good price and quick shipping
0	I 'll buy these againsoon
0	There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips
0	One bag has a lot , I generally can not finish it by myself
0	The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me
0	How convenient
0	The Kettle chips were in a 2 oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal
0	The chips are so delicious , baked not fried and lightly salted with Sea Salt
0	What more could you ask for in a great tasting chip
0	How to achieve potato chip nirvana
0	But you will enjoy ever step
0	Damn it
0	Tastes awesome though
0	
0	These are the best spicy chips I have ever had the pleasure of eating
0	They are fantastic
0	Got my case right here , and loving every bite
0	Lays ai nt got nothin on Kettle Brand
0	
0	I have never enjoyed unsalted potato chips before these
0	They have a natural potato flavor with thick , crunchy chips
0	The only bad thing is the bag is a pain to open
0	Use scissors and save yourself the aggravation
0	I especially love the curled up chips for extra texture and crunch
0	These 2 oz bags are perfect for anyone who has a problem controlling portions like me
0	
0	Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands
0	Kettle Brand chips do n't have trans fats , MSG or artificial flavors and colorings
0	The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosherbr br Annette Solomon , a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with Spicy Thai chips
0	These chips are spicy , so you would want to select a semisweet white wine
0	Also , a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger , lime , garlic and cilantro without overpowering them
0	Classically , a Germanstyle Riesling fits these parameters perfectly
0	The Honey Dijon chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans , coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat
0	Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands
0	Kettle Brand chips do n't have trans fats , MSG or artificial flavors and colorings
0	These chips are spicy , so you would want to select a semisweet white wine
0	Also , a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger , lime , garlic and cilantro without overpowering them
0	Classically , a Germanstyle Riesling fits these parameters perfectly
0	Kettle chips are thicker and crunchier though greasier at times than other chips , and the honey dijon flavor is great
0	They do n't have the overwhelming salty taste some cheaper chips have , and the 2 oz size is great for an adult size snack
0	Not with these , the vinegar is overflowing right from the first chip and does nt stop until you 've finished the bag
0	These are very addictive
0	If you like salt and vinegar , these are the ultimate chips
0	Nothing else compares
0	Tasted good
0	Spicy
0	Those that do n't like spicy should stay away from this
0	For the price paid , very good buy
0	These are seriously delicious , especially if you like plain potato chips
0	Need scissors
0	there 's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves
0	I suggest a blotshake on some paper towels before consuming
0	Either way , they have a yummy potato taste , and very satisfying crunch
0	Delicious
0	This bags are very difficult to open with the aid of some tool , such as scissors , do n't even try without scissorsbr br They are crispy and taste like chips that are n't advertised as being salted
0	Kettle Foods , Inc is a Green Giant , a company highlighted for their environmental practices
0	They convert waste oils to biodiesel to power some of their company cars
0	Not only are their efforts for the future but they care for the present by rejuvenate a neighboring 2 acre wetland ecosystem
0	These really are amazing chips
0	Do n't be put off by one of the cheeses being blue cheeseit is so subtle that even blue cheese haters like mewill enjoy these
0	These chips are delectably delicious
0	I am on a low sodium diet
0	There is just a kiss worth on a chip , but beleive me , it is a total makeout
0	
0	Not too salty like regular supermarket chips , this is a snack that will not overwhelm you with guilt
0	I agree with the company motto A Natural Obsession
0	I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent
0	The flavor of these is very strong , so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor , like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread
0	Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food
0	These are flavorful and crunchy and will make your mouth happy
0	These are my new favorite
0	I would have given the product 5 stars easily had it not been for the price
0	The taste is fabulous   you wo n't be disappointed
0	These chips were good
0	these are the best chips out there nothing can beat this taste
0	
0	At first I was thinking , cheese flavored chips
0	The herbs they used are just delicious
0	The cheese is not overpowering
0	They are yummy and crispy
0	
0	The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market
0	However , Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used , with ginger being the most important that is now missing
0	Notice that they removed ginger with attitude from the bag
0	Sadly , the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me
0	Way to ruin a great thing
0	Chips are noticeably not fresh in taste
0	Wo n't order againbr br EDIT And just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it , black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat
0	The chips are tangy and crunchy and satisfy your potato chip fix like no other brand
0	and THAT is the problem
0	I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price
0	Well being used to the cheaper chips I was n't expecting how mellow these things are
0	So , for the price and how many you get , these chips are definately worth it
0	I recommend these , 4 stars
0	I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to bootbr br   How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt
0	For those who love salt and vinegar potato chips , this is the one to choose
0	The flavor is zippy and tart , with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less natural versions of this snack
0	The 2ounce bags are just right to share at lunch
0	I do n't care for the fancy flavors and these are salted just right
0	These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a low salt item
0	By comparison , Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy
0	Fantastic tasting potato chips
0	I love the individual bags , great for kids and adults too
0	The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips
0	The bags are very strong   much thicker than , say , Lay 's potato chip bags
0	Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips , salted just right
0	Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion , some are cooked more than others , which gives it a more authentic , nonmanufactured feel
0	Great quality and much cheaper than in the stores
0	Will definitely be buying more
0	Yes , they are good
0	However , they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff , which is initially satisfying then becomes too much
0	And certainly is n't good for the waistline or general nutritional issuesbr br AND the package ca n't be opened without a sharp implement
0	I do n't normally carry a knife or scissors and do n't have rodent teeth
0	Even then , the bag was wow thick and toughbr br On the package it says these are Krinkle Cut chips
0	Turns out that means the corrugated kind , not what I wanted
0	So this information is importantbr br These are good but so are other brands with which I do n't have these problems
0	Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available
0	On the minus side , a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it
0	Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy
0	What 's wrong with simply light and crispy
0	This kettle chips taste Good , Crispy   Crunchy   too
0	U will enjoy it also
0	Moreover , it 's thinly cut   sliced
0	I really like the balance in the flavor
0	Definitely recommend it for fans of Earl Grey with a kick
0	I have a cup every morning , very smooth refreshing tea
0	The price is very competitive
0	I have ordered it a number of times , and each batch is consistently excellent
0	I have even given it as a gift , as its container is superb for keeping loose tea fresh
0	The metal canister has an inner lid that is lifted with its own attached knob , so the tea stays dry and fresh for the length of time it takes to use it up
0	These biscuits are delicious , not too sweet , with just enough crunch
0	Quick delivery
0	Very satisfied
0	Excellent , lofat , lo calorie treat for dogs
0	I was desperate to find a treat that would measure up
0	He gets one heartshaped biscuit at bedtime
0	He sleeps in a crate
0	They are well worth the price
0	This product does a great job of clearing out the kidneys
0	Love this with a bag of shrimp 34 pound , some stir fry veges and a little onion chopped
0	Not too hot but very tasty
0	So I got this and tasted it strait out of the bottle , it tasted like smoky flavored milk   YUCK
0	I tried to doctor up the soda with a little SF Vanilla Torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream   IT TASTED AMAZING
0	I put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it , it tasted fine
0	It was such a happy accident to find out how to use it
0	When added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in creambr br It is VERY potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting , if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch
0	It tastes wonderful and is half the price of storeboughtbr br It is excellent
0	It would pop up here and there , and then disappear
0	The next day , it was gone
0	It is old fashioned drink from Michigan , since 1866 , and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character
0	If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste
0	Vernors has a strong vanilla presence , is smoother and more moist , and sweeter than a ginger ale
0	It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale , very good
0	A ginger ale is more dry , higher in carbonation , and has a spicier bite to it
0	Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can , versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale
0	Neither has caffeinebr br The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners
0	The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors
0	Many microbrews are using cane sugar again , although it costs more , to get a better taste
0	Vernor 's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years , no doubt accounting for the smoothness
0	All in all a great soda for anytime
0	That is why it sells here
0	Vernors has quite a history , and there are two books at Amazon about the soda
0	The first is Vernor 's Ginger Ale Images of America Michigan ISBN10 0738551856
0	The second book is The Vernor 's Story From Gnomes to Now ISBN10 0472066978 a book about the company 's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome , and Vernor 's fans
0	If you want to find a good flavor substitute for maple syrup , barley malt , or brown rice syrup , this will do nicely
0	However , when it was in stock , it was priced well for the 2packbr br Other than baking , I 've used it to top waffles , pancakes , and in small doses 12 teaspoon added it to oatmeal
0	Recipes with dried fruit need much less , cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F if there is oil in the recipe , cut it by 13 alternately , use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid   just do n't use too much or your recipe will be dry
0	Additionally , when baking , make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry
0	However , I highly recommend it for baking
0	Good quality nectar
0	Keeps the blood sugar stable
0	Great buy also
0	This sweetner is the best , it brings out the true flavors in what ever you add it to
0	And it has great health benefts
0	I love this stuff
0	It sweetens without affecting the blood glucose levels
0	Just kidding
0	I finally have found a natural sugar substitute that has the added benefit of having a low glycemic index
0	Agave is delicious
0	I have recommended it to many friends , and it is very economical to purchase the 46 oz bottles
0	I used to buy the Wholesome Sweetners agave and like it a little better , but switched because it became too expensive
0	So this is the cheeper option
0	I do n't like the container
0	It 's fine for the price
0	I love using this to sweeten tea , coffee , etc
0	It tastes much better than other low glycemic sweeteners   there is no bitter aftertaste
0	I ordered this product two times now and have been very happy with both the delivery and the product
0	This amber agave nectar has become our primary sweetener because of the low glycemic effect on blood sugar
0	The taste is mellow , and the sweetening power is higher than sugar so you use less , but without the twang of honey
0	I would not even look at sugar any more
0	I love this product
0	It last a long time , and is a good value
0	Madhava Agave Nectar is good tasting , it was a good buy
0	This stuff is great because it 's low glycemic
0	This size is economical and shipping is fast , too
0	Save a little money buying in larger quantities , as opposed to the smaller bottles
0	Good for pies , cereal , frozen yogurt , etc
0	This is an awesome product which I 've ordered many times
0	Honeylike flavored , lower glycemic sweetener that 's great in coffee or tea
0	Thanks again
0	I 've tried supermarkets , health food stores and wholesale clubs
0	The prices are usually around 13 for a 32 oz bottle and this is 19ish for 2x46 oz
0	Granulated sugar has only 45 calories per tablespoon
0	How could Agave Nectar be better than sugar
0	These are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat , but oompletely enjoyable
0	You finish the bag and the indside is just coated with spices
0	Great stuff
0	These are the best tasting tortilla chips I have ever had
0	There is so much flavor in these chips that I no longer miss pico de gallo
0	These potato chips are DELICIOUS
0	They are pure and void of all artificial flavorings
0	The true flavor is present , and it satisifies the need for something salty , sweet , spicy , and crunchy
0	A
0	These chips are a great snack if you do n't want all the junk assiciated with chips
0	I love these chips
0	The flavor is not plain
0	They are sweet and spicy all at the same time
0	The only drawback is it has a tad bit too much salt
0	But , it still a great flavor
0	They have a great balance of sweetness and spice
0	Very hard to find in New Jersey
0	Can not have just one bag around
0	
0	I ca n't believe how wonderful this chip is
0	The slightly spicy after taste gives the chip extra punch and flavor
0	These chips are perfect for snacking with or without salsa
0	The texture is brittle and thin , like other Plocky 's chipsbr br The only downside the spice is minimal
0	These are the best chips I have ever eaten
0	Sweet but spicy crispyreally good
0	Delivery was perfect , no crushed chips
0	Fantastic overall
0	A nice case of chips that are quite tasty
0	OH MY WORD
0	Spicy but not burning spicy , more like tonguewarming , sweetish , saltya really stronglyflavored and delicious chip
0	My bad
0	Geeshbr br Yes , 150 cals per 1 oz serving
0	That 's about par for the course for fried chipsbr br Verdict Fattening , crispy , flavorful , delicious
0	Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a lowfat sandwich or soupbr br Enjoybr br Mir
0	They are really very good
0	They taste better than more well known brands and are very satisfying
0	Not with Plocky'sI always eat less and feel satisfied
0	There are actual pieces of beans in the chips and they are not overly salty like other chips
0	It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store
0	Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued
0	The one star is for the substitution
0	The country bbq is a 4 start chip , but not the chip I longed for
0	We love these chips
0	It sure is
0	Unique and different flavor and the right thicknessbr br It remains crunchy , spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat
0	There are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips
0	However , some of the spices are lacking from this chip
0	Go ahead you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese
0	Maybe some el pastor , shredded meat , tomatoes , etcetera
0	I Love these chips for its unique taste and incredible crispy texture
0	Running out of them constantly
0	These chips are the only ones I found to be tasty and healthy
0	They have fewer fat calories plus higher fiber for those who want good taste and nutritionthe perfect blend
0	We love these
0	Strong enough to dip in any condiment , great flavor and grain texture
0	These spicy chips have a lot of great flavor but be warned , you will be left with some stanky breath afterwards
0	Your prices are terrific too
0	Good job
0	These chips are delicious
0	For chips they are also very healthy
0	Plocky 's Red Beans and Rice Tortilla Chips are really tasty
0	No artificial stuff
0	
0	  sweet and spicy but not overwhelming just enough to work up the palate , not salty just enough to balance out the sweetness I will be ordering these again soon
0	LOVe IT
0	The service was respectable and the shipping free
0	I love this product
0	All of the different flavors are fantastic
0	My family likes the 3 grain the best
0	No more corn tortilla chips in this house
0	Love these chips , and I do n't even like black beans
0	Very tasty
0	Yum
0	Plus , good for you
0	These chips are FANFREAKINTASTIC
0	A nice sweet smoky flavor and then a little bitoheat
0	OH YA BABY
0	Nice amount of heat and smoke
0	Very tasty chip that goes great with a brew
0	These chips are salty with a hint of sweet
0	They are crisp and crunchy
0	really love , was out of stock
0	  Nancy Walsh
0	Ok
0	It wo n't last long
0	Beware
0	The texture is light and crispy , rather than thick and crunchy
0	I highly recommend these
0	WOW
0	The spicy flavor grabs you at the first bite
0	Once a bag is open , it is gone
0	We like these chips for salsa and quacomole better than any other cips on the market
0	I guess there 's no telling what will tickle the palate
0	Practically bland , in fact
0	Do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 12
0	Yeast Extract is listed as an ingredient
0	Sounds harmless , right
0	Specifically , these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract , which is , on a chemical level , monosodium glutamate
0	It 's just derived from a different source , but it has all the same toxic properties
0	These were not flavorful enough for my taste
0	It seems that all the seasoning falls off the chips and sinks to the bottom of the bag
0	Too bad , because I really liked the idea of a healthier potato chip
0	I would not buy these again
0	Plocky 's chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness
0	They are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips
0	The flavor out performs any tortilla chip I have ever eaten
0	They hold up great to salsas and dips
0	Nothing wimpy about them
0	I just wish the company made a bigger bag
0	Love them
0	Usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery , but seem to be difficult to obtain as the shelf is always empty
0	Order by the case
0	My case of chips came without any packing inside
0	All bags in a box with no cushioning at all
0	A great item but if they ca n't package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money
0	I immediately ordered a case
0	These chips are light , crispy , flavorful , and good for you
0	These chips are truly amazing
0	They have it all
0	Need I say more
0	These are the most fantastic chips I 've ever had
0	I could eat the whole bag myself
0	They are great
0	We need a bigger bag
0	
0	I did not like these potatoe chips
0	It 's hot , and sweet , with an overwhelming taste of garlic
0	It 's also a bit salty
0	Long story short   these are very tasty
0	This may well help in shipping , but when paying a premium price for ' organic ' it just seems more deceptive
0	Wonderful candy , hard to find
0	I got a huge bag and put it in freezer
0	It came shipped nicely in a sturdy box and heavy plastic
0	Just great

0	These lovely pastries made our Dragon Boat Festival party much more fun
0	I really like the pineapple shortcakes sold here
0	Unlike some of the massproduction pineapple shortcakes that use artificial flavoring , Tasselfield 's pineapple shortcakes use real pineapples and it makes the whole world difference
0	Immediately I was all like Oh man , this is gon na suck
0	Regardless of the quantity error though , it sure kicked some redbr br Everyone in my town absolutely loves it
0	Everyone in village loved it , of course now they are wondering when the next shipment will get it
0	Expiration date 113
0	Smashed and
0	stale
0	This cinnamon cake loaf has a wonderful natural flavor
0	It 's delicious
0	In the future , I will read more carefully
0	The package recommended stirring before use , so I gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo
0	br I tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it
0	Well , I opened it and it is grayish sticky mess
0	Which would probably end up better and cheaper
0	Oh well , live and learn
0	I am not a picky eater , especially if the item contains sugar but this was horrible
0	The consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting
0	It is not light and fluffy
0	It is very gooey
0	I can not even imagine trying to spread it on a cake   it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey
0	I did not even try it on a cake , because the taste and texture were so offputting
0	Seriously , do not waste your money
0	This product was such a disappointment
0	As all the other reviewers said , it 's a gluey , sticky texture more akin to Elmer 's Glue than to an edible food product
0	The flavor was sickening sweet
0	I actually thought that the frosting had spoiled
0	It was that bad
0	Cherrybrook cake and cookie mixes are so good
0	It 's hard to believe they even sell this
0	It stuck to the knife , ran down in strings , what a mess
0	Who would buy this mess
0	Horrible
0	Like others said , it is a glueytacky mess that would completely ruin a cake if you tried to spread it on
0	It reminds me of taffy that has n't quite hit the right stage in the candy making process
0	The taste is n't that great either , and it 's sickeningly sweet even for frosting
0	The only thing it might be used for is a frosting for cinnamon buns
0	I still do n't think it would be the right consistency
0	It 's kind of generous to call it frosting , it has more the consistency of rubber cement
0	Horrible experience , bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever
0	It spread about as easily as chewing gum , stuck to everything it came in contact with , and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it
0	On top of all this , it did n't even taste good
0	So we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a premade cake
0	Our cake , which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey , was used as a centerpiece
0	A really ugly centerpiece , that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried
0	Well worth the money
0	I did the calculations on different bags and this dollar amount is an excellent value
0	There are approx 2338 pops in the box
0	So far I 've been through about half the box and have found about 3 without wrappers
0	That 's pretty good considering
0	If you need 30lbs of dumdums go for this product
0	Enjoy
0	This is pretty good canned meat
0	The various meats are all pretty good quality and was enough for 3 large portions each can
0	There were n't large chunks of fat or gristle in any of the cans , which I 've experienced plenty with some brands of canned meats
0	The proportion of liquids to meat was fair too , it 's not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either , though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat
0	None of the meat was seasoned , at all
0	This is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring
0	Do n't plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats , it gave everything a slightly rancid , soury tasteno idea why
0	Due to the higher calories and higher price , I will only stock this as emergency food
0	I will buy more for that reason
0	With all that 's in it , this is a very good value
0	Considering you can pay as much for any one of the ingredients in it
0	It 's quite tasty in that it 's not too sweet , very thick textured even with the tiny bits of seed in it reminiscent of a banana smoothie
0	The ingredient list is somewhat confusing but note that only the Acerola Cherry is from concentrate , everything else is fresh pressed
0	Acai is very high on the ORAC scale of antioxidants , Rose Hips are also very high , everything else is in the mid to high range of fruit
0	Pomegranate has many beneficial properties beyond just antioxidants as well , it 's a noteworthy fighter of heart disease and Alzheimer 's type dementia
0	A watered down perversion of the acai berrybr br This juice comes on strong and harsh
0	With tart aftertaste and no texturebr br That 's because it is mostly apple juice , grape juice , pomegranate juice , blackberry juice , blueberry juice , and tart cherry juice
0	Oh yeah there is some acai berry juice mixed into this concoctionbr br You shall not find that distinctive smooth chocolaty acai flavor here
0	There is no milky mouth pleasing texture neither
0	That 's not my point
0	I 'm saying that it 's a juice blend that does not taste anything like the real acai juice
0	This product is made by Annie 's Inc in Berkely , CAmade in the USA
0	The product maintains excellent organic integrity , and it is stored in 100 recycled paperboard packagingbr br The manufacturers also support family farms   use organic milk , butter , and yogurt
0	The product takes approximately 10 min
0	to prepare
0	The product contains dairy and wheat , and it has been exposed to equipment that also processes egg and soy productsbr br The ingredients include organic whole wheat shell pasta , organic valley organic cheddar cheese organic cultured pasteurized milk , salt , nonanimal enzymes , organic whey , salt , and sodium phosphatebr br This is a mildly flavored whole wheat macaroni   cheese dinner
0	This mac and cheese is a wonderful comfort food
0	The pasta is firm , and it has an excellent flavorbr br There are no artificial flavors , synthetics colors , or preservatives
0	The pasta was produced without antibiotics , synthetic hormones , or persistent pesticidesbr br This pasta is simple to make and it has a wonderful texture
0	There are 25 servings per box 25 oz

0	2 g fat , 10 mg cholest , 570 mg sodium , 43 g carb , 5 g fiber , 6 g sugars , 9 g proteinbr br However , the cheese envelop is not exactly sufficient even when you add the butter , milk , or yogurt

0	This is pretty good regular style soy sauce
0	But it is not superwonderfulbetter than any other good quality soy sauce you can buy in an Asian market
0	The main value is as a unique giftbr   In the Japanese soy sauce world , there are 4 types regular , mild usukuchi , for raw fish sashimi and light colored
0	Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style
0	Compared to Kikoman a good commercial brand that is widely available Bluegrass starts saltier , is flat in the middle , then ends with a complex   interesting flavor
0	Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round , full flavor in the middle
0	Does n't have the complex ending flavors
0	Each brand has a different flavor and everyone has their favorite
0	On a whim , I ordered a bottle
0	It took several weeks to arrive , but when it did   what a surprise
0	My teenage son wanted to try it , and did
0	He loved it immediately
0	Now he puts it on many things
0	What a treat to find a handmade American product , that competes with and wins , against a JapaneseChinese national staple
0	I had three soy sauces to choose from
0	After some sampling we were all using the Bluegrass
0	Everyone enjoyed the light smoothness a subtle sweetness
0	We were splashing right on every piece , rather that dunkingdipping
0	Friends wanted to know where I found it
0	I recently acquired a bottle of this and was immediately impressed
0	It has good flavor without all the excessive saltiness of supermarket brands
0	I 've used it for marinades and dipping sauces in addition to straight use and in all cases it has added a little something extra
0	Quite a surprise to find an American made soy sauce that tastes this good
0	This soy sauce is the best we have ever had
0	It makes a big difference when using this product
0	Thanks again
0	This is the most delicious soy sauce I have ever tasted
0	I will surely order it again
0	Such deep flavor
0	I am not sure how long the contamination will last
0	I like the idea this product claims no GMO seeds
0	TMI
0	This pack of 6 will last a while , but they 're definitely a ' will reorder '
0	
0	Need a laxative
0	This is a bold blend that has a great taste
0	The flavor comes bursting through
0	Come on Amazon add it to the subscription service
0	This is by far our favorite
0	This coffee is rich but not too stong
0	For now , we 'll buy elsewhere
0	This is one of the best choices , in my opinion
0	These are available at BedBath   Beyond for 10
0	It has a nice smooth flavor that is not overpowering , and has a pleasant aroma
0	Personally , I would enjoy it more if it were strongerbolder
0	However , being a bit mild , it goes well with breakfast andor glutenfree baked goodies
0	I find it mildly perplexing that this product is not available from tassimodirect , nor is a subscription service available
0	Originally found this at Dead Bats from Beyond , used a 20 coupon , and was happy with the final price
0	This coffee is good but , for me , it 's nothing special
0	Just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15 Kona
0	And do n't expect it to come in a flash , as it did when Amazon Prime delivered it
0	Really light and creamy
0	This kind of tea not good Taste and smell so wear it 's not like tea , and feel like some thing chemical
0	The Milka Naps Mix Gift Box is a fun , unique gift for those tired of Whitman 's and the usual American brands
0	Nothing wrong with Whitman 's , but sometimes a change of look and flavor is nicebr br As a sampler , it provides only a few of the Milka options
0	Four flavors are here noisette , hazelnuts , alpine milk and strawberry
0	All are delicious , though I do n't like strawberrychocolate in any candy personally , and give those away to eager friends
0	The Naps box are perfect for coffee tables and as a standalone dish at workbr br Milka and its famous purple cow , is owned by Kraft , is an eastern European chocolate originally produced in Switzerland and is available in Germany , Austria , Hungary and other nearby countriesbr br Distribution is still weak in the United States , but can be found increasingly in larger cities
0	Usually , then , it is found only in international grocery stores , though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time
0	It has been around 100 years
0	Whether or not Kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen
0	For now , the texture and taste are better than Hershey 's and Nestle
0	Great candy and our family loved it
0	The shipping to the USA makes it expenive
0	No other item inside our fridge turned bad
0	This product works wonders if you have stomach issues
0	0
0	Bought this at a local specialtyitem store because I adore chutney
0	Because of the higher price and being sold like a gourmet item I wrongly thought it would be better than the affordable brands sold at the supermarket
0	Wrong
0	It is mostly gel jelly with a few fruits sprinkled throughout and tastes like cheap thickened jelly you put on sandwichesI've had much better and that 's just talking about the supermarket brands
0	Very disappointed
0	Money does not buy quality
0	The price was reasonable compared to our local pet store , which does n't often have this item in stock
0	My son made this
0	Determined to be polite , I agreed to have a sandwich using the bread
0	It was amazing
0	Apparently it rises during the baking or somethingbr br Great tangy flavor perfect for a meat sandwich imho and not heavy at all
0	These were great   just as described
0	This is NOT Disco Dust which is edible and made for baking
0	DO NOT purchase this product for such purposes
0	Really easy project for family fun anytime not just for Christmas
0	Just put icing between cookies and stack
0	Then ice outside and decorate
0	Great for all ages
0	Cookies do get a little softer in the middlebr br Make anytime of year
0	Leave off wreat and Patrick and cut out Spongebob 's head so does not look like chirstmas
0	It was a really fun idea that we enjoyed creating
0	The licorice was worthless though
0	this is n't as easy as it looks , does n't came with enough yellow frosting , and the frosting does n't stick very well
0	Which is odd
0	I looked everywhere and could not find ont
0	The gingerbread itself came broken
0	Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken
0	It 's non returnable
0	This one also came broken
0	But two of the same thing in a row
0	I think it 's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped
0	But it 's bubble wrapped very well
0	I think the gingerbread is n't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off
0	The rest of the kit is very cute
0	The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box
0	But the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags
0	Too bad
0	But I would try something else , stay away from this one
0	It probably helps my location is near
0	Everything looks just as described and pictured and I 'm very happy to have done business with this seller
0	The Gingerbread house was carefully packaged as not to harm the fragile pieces inside
0	I 'm excited to give this item as a gift
0	The whole idea of a Spongebob Ginger Bread Pineapple is really great , but the sticker that says Use By Has a 10 JN 16 date on it
0	If that s 2010 this is not good
0	The least the seller could do is to check the expiration date
0	Its right on the front of the box
0	Not happy at all
0	
0	This tea carries the flavor one would expect from the smell terrible
0	My motherinlaw said , Oh , that smells kind of like wine
0	Okay , kind of like wine , with a hint of rot and a moldy aftertaste
0	If it were possible to give this product zero stars , I would have done so
0	After arriving home from the grocery , I immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner
0	Between sorting , washing , and chopping items , the hot water was added to the bag to steep
0	Preparation continued , until a distinctly off odor hit me
0	Even after cleaning up , and airing out the kitchen , my roommate later came in and asked about the smell
0	Save your money to purchase ANY other Twinings product
0	This tea is the best tea i 've ever had
0	i first tasted it in norway , and had to find it in the states
0	It 's a sweet tea , which makes it a wonderful healthy alternative to desert after dinnerbr br I see that others did n't like it , but it 's really a matter of personal tastedifferent courses for different horses
0	The best chocolate in the world , in this critic 's humble opinion , is made in the United States
0	And the best chocolate in the United States is made in California , by the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company
0	It is surely the best chocolate that one can find in so many stores , malls , etc
0	throughout the United States
0	These are chocolates deserving of poetry
0	The choice is up to you
0	This is a good quality brand of chocolate with many flavours of which this is just one
0	Very tasty and a fast delivery too
0	My mother and father were the recipient of these wonderful pieces of chocolate heaven
0	This is the best caramelchocolate combination I have ever tasted
0	The caramel is liquid and complements the Ghiradelli chocolate perfectly
0	The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares , and the Caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste
0	Comparing the two is like comparing Warren Buffett to myself in terms of wealth
0	Unfortunately I am the Caramello bar in this regardbr   At the very least try the Ghiradelli
0	Lesson learned
0	
0	This chocolate treat is a great gift and it arrived right when I expected it to
0	Are people really paying 10 bucks for these chocolates
0	ummmm go to any grocery store and by them for 298 a bagwow
0	Low calorie and satisfying
0	This was really a disappointment
0	While the products included are fine , the real disappointment was the travel mug
0	It is a cheap plastic cup with the nutritional information for the cookies on it
0	So it is basically just a cookie package
0	Yeah , that is really what I want to use as a travel mug
0	I agree with the review that it looks like it came from a dollar store
0	The product description says the polka dot tumbler is definitely a keeper
0	What
0	It is simply cheap packaging
0	Not something of quality to enjoy
0	I like the products inside and the basket is OK , but really this what not what it appeared to be
0	It looks pretty , but the contents are very minute and seem to not be of very high quality
0	There 's a plastic cup for the tea that looks like it came from a dollar store
0	The basket is nice , though
0	Purchased this as a gift for my mother when it was a lightning deal
0	She was very happy and loved the basket
0	She enjoyed the cookies and the flavors of tea that were included
0	Shipped quick and arrived when expected
0	Received very quickly and extremely well packaged
0	Since this is a smaller sized basket , it would be an adorable present for anyone who likes tea , for self or just to have to hand
0	Very nicely assembled with attention to detail
0	Amazon now provides a link
0	They can be used for what are commonly called jello shots , and provide a solid edible alternative to small paper cups
0	I bought these chocolate liquor cups for a party
0	It was a big hit
0	They are high quality and a good buy
0	Great for serving Chocolate liquor
0	Being able to eat the cup afterwards is just icing on the cake
0	Delicious chocolate cups , each in its own aluminum holder
0	After sipping thebr liquor , you can eat the cup
0	What could be nicer
0	Excellent product
0	The holiday liquor cups were exactly what I was looking for
0	The chocolate isbr delicious and holds up well to the liquors
0	strawberry twist has a longlasting pleasant flavor SWEETbut , not excessively so
0	delivery is timely and price is just right
0	Supieror to other TRIDENT flavors
0	Though , SPEARMINT is n't bad either
0	My next pick would be blueberry
0	Trident Strawberry Twist sugarless gum is very disappointing , both in taste and consistency
0	The strawberry flavor is very artificial tasting and , though I guess it is a good thing , not very long lasting
0	The gum also gets stringy fairly quicklybr br I chew a lot of gum , but will not be buying this flavor againbr br Not Recommendedbr br CFH
0	I 'd say , on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 lasting an extraordinary amount of time this would be a 3
0	Also , the taste really diminishes to a subdued sweet after a very short amount of time
0	The gum tasted fresh which is actually way better than when I used to buy it in stores
0	OK it does n't really taste like strawberry , but it 's still delicious
0	BEST DOG FOOD ON THE MARKET TODAY
0	She was also slightly overweight
0	It is specially designed for their teeth and health needs , and she loves it
0	And it is actually cheaper here than at the fancy pet store
0	What more could you ask
0	PetsMart and Petco carried the Cocker Spaniel formula but only in smaller bags which is much more expensive on a per ounce ratio
0	Finding a larger bag has been a great deal
0	My cocker loves the food too
0	It also is packaged very well and as a result stays fresh for a long period of time
0	Great product
0	However all the dogs love it
0	It seems to have cleared up , no more smell
0	All these great changes in a matter of a month
0	Thanks
0	Our skin and fur is much better now too
0	
0	Hard to find elsewhere
0	This is a very high quality oatmeal and much cheaper and better than anything I 've found in the grocery store
0	Better than organic oats advertised elsewhere
0	Takes lots of water
0	These are not minute oats , so my oatmeal cookies come out right , not all crumbly and soggy
0	Instant oats have their place , but not in cookies
0	Honeyville Rolled Oats is a delicious product
0	Their flavor is above all the rest
0	Nice flavor , not too bitter
0	We really like this coffee
0	We have been searching for a coffee that pleases the whole family 's tastes and this is the one
0	I did not like this new taste
0	Cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured
0	New Zealand is uses more cream than Australia , etc
0	The flavor is strong and a bit smoky , like Darjeeling , only earthier
0	Like Darjeeling or Earl Grey , it has enough flavor on its own   no milk or sugar needed
0	But it 's expensive by the box of teabags
0	Finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic
0	It arrived promptly , wellsealed , and true to the label   unlike some loose tea that 's actually cut up , this has the whole leaves that unfurl
0	Ahhh
0	This tea has surpassed all other breakfast teas in this teadrinking household
0	Perhaps it has more caffeine than our old favorites
0	a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB001ELL9X6Numi Organic Tea Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea , Loose Leaf , 16 oz bag Pack of 2aI brew iced tea in the refrigerator by the halfgallon with this tea
0	Excellent
0	The taste is harsh as it is a lesser grade of Yunnan
0	It is ok to drink , but not to really enjoy
0	This tea is my daily regular tea
0	It 's aromatic and flavorful without any additives
0	It always amazes me that there are not dozens of reviews here extolling the fine qualities of this tea
0	It 's an excellent morning tea , is smooth without being insipid , and is almost impossible to ruin by oversteeping
0	Just use decent water
0	It brings out the natural sweetness of its malty , slightly floral style
0	I just bought another two pounds
0	I hardly ever write reviews but this tea is quite excellent
0	I decided to try it without any sweetener or any other added taste enhancers
0	It is flavorful without being overpowering
0	It is a great pleasure to have a fine tea like this loose and reasonably priced
0	After the first try I have continued to drink it just as it comes
0	To my mind , a fine caramel should be creamy and melting
0	These are grainy
0	The flavor on these was fine , although a little sweet to my taste
0	Wonderful service from Ms Das , including a hand signed coupon for a discount on future orders , along with samples of a couple other caramel flavors
0	This is certainly the best caramels I have ever had
0	I just wish it came in bigger pieces
0	I finished the whole box in one sitting
0	Not my idea of a good caramel
0	Flavors of ginger and pistachio dominated
0	Same for the chocolate walnut and orange honey varieties
0	This baking soda works great for cooking or for health reasons
0	I take it for acid indigestion and heart burn
0	Just a 1 tsp in a half glass of water and it 's gone
0	Thanks , Bob
0	Too bad that baking SODA does not in any form contain aluminum
0	This is , however a concern for baking POWDER which can , depending on manufacturer , contain aluminum
0	The product is of high quality , and has a rich full flavorbr br Delivery was unexpectedly fastbr br The only negative I would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack
0	While this may be commonplace , a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight , food grade , plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag
0	Could be either a ziplock bag or a twist tie closure does n't make any difference just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of itbr br This is a health and spoilage issue 50 's of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers very expensive and hard to find
0	I am a single senior who likes to buy staple goods in bulk to save money and provide food security
0	Long term storage is a big issue with people like mebr br Thom Missouri
0	I 'm happy with the quality of the product and the price
0	Like the other reviewer , I would prefer if there was a plastic liner to preserve freshness
0	Product is fresh , good and I 'm not getting complaints anymorebr br That 's worth the large quantity and shipping chargesbr br Hey , its oatmeal
0	My favorite
0	Good quality oats
0	Package came on time
0	Oats worked well in recipes
0	I looooove pocky , got once at lucky 's and could nt stop , its like the chocolate is laced with crack
0	anywho , the product is good , the only sad thing is that it was shipped or stored in a hot room and the chocolate melted together partially , but it did nt take too much effort to take apart the sticksbr br Great product , and great price from this merchant
0	Be sure to keep them refridgerated
0	As far as delivery , the product came in good condition , timely , and was terrific
0	Definitely a good buy
0	  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbingside of the stick is right at the topbr br Each of the packets has 210 calories 90 from fat , and about 80 mg of sodium   so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option
0	Duh
0	
0	The chocolate on the stick was all melted and all the sticks were stuck with oneanother
0	I now love mi goreng
0	Just like the description states , its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate
0	I would n't say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess , well , as long as the chocolate does n't melt

0	Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime
0	In my opinion , the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back
0	The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste , more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate
0	The taste is n't terrible but its definitely not to my liking
0	Bought these for my daughter 's Grad party as well as the Strawberry
0	She loves these things
0	They 're a great product
0	Everyone in our family except one really likes the taste of this
0	It is addicting
0	Pocky is just plain fun to eat
0	Very nicebr br This is by no means a health food it 's in the same category as a cookie , it 's got fat and sugar and nonhealthful ingredients
0	But hey , it 's junk food
0	I would n't recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes
0	They 're really so good , oh man
0	Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and they 'll likely carry Japanese snacks like these
0	On top of that the package of dessert pocky I ordered in 100 degree weather melted into this liquid goo
0	Well , they did stick together just a bit
0	The chocolate was falling off from the biscuit stick , and does n't taste as it should
0	The Pocky arrived in good condition with minimal melting and very few broken pieces
0	The guys in the family seem to like it better than the ladies for some reason
0	For a bit of insanity , search for Pocky commercials on youtube
0	The individual Pocky sticks are not separately packaged and melt and stick together while being shipped
0	This product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award
0	The box only contains 5 bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal , so at least 50 of the interior of the box is air
0	The rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper
0	On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor
0	The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie
0	They seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process
0	That is why I 've continued to try their products
0	The kids liked them too
0	I love the soft texture and the non crumbly state
0	It makes for clean car rides
0	Since then they like the apple and chocolate bars the best
0	Berry is always left for last
0	Unfortunately , these were pretty gross   miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry
0	I agree with a previous post
0	A total bummer   they were better in the past but something changed with the taste , along with their new packaging
0	
0	My son with multiple food allergies really enjoys these bars
0	They also have a nice chewyness
0	not too sweet but just right
0	any allergy free food is great in my book
0	hope non of these ingredients contains Cornthats a no no for me too
0	IF THE SIZE IT LESS THEN SO SHOULD THE CHARGE
0	THIS WILL EFFECT MY DECISION IN BUYING AGAIN
0	The boxes are now a plain , generic designyou know , the kind all brands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper
0	Guess what
0	Cheaper ingredients
0	They are oily and bland
0	I thought Enjoy Life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a goodtasting product
0	I was wrong
0	In summary , these are way too expensive to be made with lowquality , unpalatable ingredients
0	Refer to the picture I posted above
0	The bar is half the size you think it is going to beIt is literally a twobite bar
0	Very deceptive advertising
0	That and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star
0	Could n't give it away
0	Everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as I 'm concerned
0	With all the allergies in our family , these ended up working out great
0	I 'm new to food allergies
0	It 's got pretty good texture , taste and heft
0	But each bar is an ounce and 120 calories on par with many other breakfast bars
0	My son has severe allergies
0	Tasty , convenient bars for people with celiac disease
0	They seem to have gotten smaller over time , but the taste and convenience outweigh the reduction in size and the price
0	My favorite flavor is the apple and nut
0	This brand of granola bars are really good
0	The very berry are my favorite
0	However , the bars are almost ridiculously small
0	They really are tiny
0	So , the taste is GREAT but the bar is small
0	Hard to find when roaming around
0	Great taste
0	Great ingredients
0	Great texture
0	Absolutely delicious
0	These snack bars fit the bill
0	They have the mouthfeel of a traditional snack bar , and a pleasant tartsweet fruit flavor
0	I buy these regularly
0	Imagine taking some kids ' playground chalk , perhaps that tan colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks
0	Being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth
0	TRY IT

0	This is the best coffee we 've ever had
0	A light taste but very full bodied
0	I was very pleased with the packaging , having it resealable keeps it stay fresher much longer and unlike other brands this construction stays intact
0	This is the best coffee we 've ever had
0	Hundreds of people come to The Pavilion every day looking for American coffee and they were not disappointed
0	Buy it

0	For those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white Jasmine tea , Numi 's Flower Jewel is worth a look
0	About the size of a gumball , these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower
0	They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this teabr br Decorative does not mean tasteless
0	As a white tea , the flavor is mild , but rich and soothing
0	The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea
0	I have had stronger jasmine teas , but this one is quite balanced and tasty
0	I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade
0	The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and do n't get bitter if seeped for long periodsbr br I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels
0	Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart , though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact
0	Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf
0	The first ball worked pretty well , it just looked a little beaten up
0	Since then , half of these have fallen to pieces in hot water all of them do after sitting for a bit
0	If you do n't mind the rate of failure , the tea itself is pretty good and fairly tolerant of being steeped for a long time especially considering that it is white tea
0	Numi has a winner here with this tea
0	It is very pleasant and the reason they love it , it does not turn bitter after longer steeping , like other teas do
0	The product is all that it says it is which is why I gave it 5 stars
0	It smells like an Indian spice and while it did n't work for me , scentwise , it may work fine with someone else
0	Both our twins love this one right from the start but it 's not loaded with lentils see ingredients below
0	Along with some others , we get this one with the subscription
0	Of course , with twins one is forced to buy more in bulk and we 're so busy that it 's great to get these deliveredbr br The packaging is excellent
0	After water , sweet potatoes are the first ingredient in this one , followed by apricot puree
0	That 's dessert for them right there
0	After that comes the chicken and then brown rice flour not as good as brown rice thoughbr br This is a meal that babies around the age of mine are probably almost all going to love instantly
0	Almost all babies love sweet potatoes for starters
0	Add apricot puree and there 's really not much one could do to discourage babies after that
0	This list of ingredients looks excellent and it 's a green color naturallybr br The babies liked it
0	Earth 's Best Turkey Vegetable Dinner hits the spot with apples with turkey
0	Babies love carrots since they 're sweet to their taste , so that made a great addition
0	My little girl ca n't get enough of this
0	I like that it is organic and contains fruit , veggies , protein and grains in one tasty meal
0	Its my daughter 's favorite first and foremost
0	Wow , i am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the jars
0	My daughter does n't like a lot of baby foods , but will eat this one
0	It 's also a bit bland , so I add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up
0	As an added bonus , it works wonders for her digestive tract
0	I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken
0	I wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein
0	This is my son 's favorite dinner
0	Best of all it seems it has the best combo of protein 21 , vitamin A 100 and C 30
0	It is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it
0	Love love love this brand and flavor
0	Would be a quality product if it were n't so thin
0	Nearly the consistency of soup
0	It just makes too much of a mess no matter how careful you try to be
0	Its not the case
0	Enter this product
0	The truth is , is that yes , it has a bit of fruit in it , but its not sweet at all
0	The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you do n't have to add anything else
0	Its a great product to enter proteins into baby 's diet
0	The consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal to it also , baby will not choke on it
0	I highly recommend
0	I 've tried it myself and think it is pretty gross
0	But my daughter still eats it , just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors
0	It 's got a decent amount of protein , which is important for us as a vegetarian family
0	My triplets will not eat this , eventhe one who will eat ANYTHING
0	The consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon
0	My baby LOVES sweet potatoes
0	Ick
0	The flavor is just right , not too sweet or too savory , and does n't have a strong chicken flavor
0	Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp , thus it 's a very good first protein to offer , and good for picky eaters
0	However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gaggingtexture problems
0	This is the only food my daughter will eat consistly
0	She really enjoys it
0	The packaging is great
0	Never had any broken having ordered 4 times
0	My son loves the rice and lentil jars
0	It 's not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice jars
0	I have it on order with subscribe and save   amazon mom and it always arrives nicely packaged
0	It was one of their favorite baby foods
0	Great price
0	I was appalled
0	Do n't buy Earth 's Best
0	Really disappointing
0	He eats the entire jar for dinner and always wants more
0	The product shipped very quickly
0	She loved it at first
0	I 've tried some of it as well
0	I added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon
0	I like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein
0	I love the fact that there is turkey being offered
0	This is my son 's 2nd favorite dish
0	No issues with it and a good balance of nutrients
0	Only three jars came in a form edible to babies
0	The rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water
0	It also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixturebr Pretty disappointing and a waste of money
0	This is one of my son 's favorite baby foods
0	It does have a bit of sweetness , but not too sweet
0	It 's more runny than some of the other flavors , so we use a deeper spoon with this one , or add a little rice cereal to thicken it up
0	For whatever reason , our son really likes this flavor
0	Some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar
0	That 's a fair price   not an amazing deal , but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store
0	It 's a good one
0	My daughter LOVES it
0	He was so picky
0	Their foods taste greateven for us adult and so good for you too
0	Little Baby Picky will only eat this sometimes
0	This one is more watery than the others , so keep that in mind
0	There is absolutely nothing bad to say about these
0	Great on the go snack
0	My daughter loved this stuff
0	It is all natural and made very well
0	Good to mix with other things as they get older too
0	Beats Gerber
0	My daughter is outgrowing baby food but will still eat this
0	To be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible
0	Up all night screaming from gas pains
0	Garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies
0	She refused to eat it
0	I would n't recommend this flavor
0	The consistency of the food makes it easy for him to eat   not too thick , not too thin
0	This is my daughter 's most favorite baby food by far
0	This is the only ones she 'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds
0	However , the taste is very bland , for me as an adult at least
0	PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD
0	They like all the flavors though
0	Great textures too
0	I just learned this and am telling everyone   only glass recycles forever
0	It 's not even a hard thing to do anymore
0	Stop being lazy
0	Plastic
0	in food
0	baby food
0	Pretty good product
0	The taste is n't the best but it 's definitely not the worse either
0	It gives a pretty smooth energetic kick
0	He said the fruit was very fresh and sweet
0	Happy with this healthy purchase
0	This fruit gift really was the perfect gift
0	Everything was fresh , well packed and tasty looking
0	And the people that received it assured me that it was quite tasty tasting too
0	And tried the chocolate covered cherries ad was surprised at how delicious they were
0	So thank you
0	Dharana , San Francisco
0	The Fruit actually tasted fresh and yummy
0	I have never seen it in a tea bag before
0	The bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that I will buy again and again
0	Plus the shipping time was great
0	I would dig tender roots or bark a few trees for a delightful tea
0	I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product
0	Not a good bargain
0	I switched to Pappy 's extract
0	The tea is excellent and the price was right for me
0	She absolutely loves it , made a great surprise christmas gift
0	I 'm actually gon na order the 4pack and continue drinking it over time
0	Do n't trust the FDA
0	
0	bought this for my dad
0	I first tasted Sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it
0	So I started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form
0	I was told is was Pappy 's Sassafras Concentrate
0	I was very dissapointed
0	It did n't taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting
0	It was more like black licorice , which I hate , with a very mild rootbeer undertone
0	Bottom line I wo n't buy the teabags again
0	Great tasting tea I have been looking for a good Sassafras tea foreverFinally
0	I will be ordering this product again br Thanks KimD
0	It did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful
0	Yucky , yucky stuff
0	These are good sunflower seeds at a good price if you prefer the unsalted variety , which can be hard to findbr br One thing to keep in mind though , is the expiration or best by date
0	And it 's very hot , did n't have to add any spices at all
0	Great product , will purchase again
0	Now as far as the item itself , this brand of Panang Paste is excellent
0	The beef panang dish my friend made using this paste was as good as the ones in the Thai restaurant
0	I would recommend the paste but not the price
0	Best paste I have tried
0	So easy to use
0	Just saute you meat , add veggies , paste , and a tin of coconut milk
0	Quick and tasty
0	I am on weight watchers and tried using the light coconut milk instead of the full fat
0	It works for the panang paste especially if you add a heaping tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter but the yellow , green , and red are spicy and need the full fat coconut milk to balance it out
0	OMG I would love these cookies except for the chocolate mixed in makes it taste medicinal
0	DEGUSTING is n't even a strong enough word
0	HORRIBLE , HORRIBLE , DISGUTINGLY , MEDICINAL TASTE
0	DO NOT BUY
0	This gravy mix is excellent   except , do n't use water where called for , use milk instead , and it makes it 100 better
0	
0	BY FAR
0	BISQUICK CHEESE GARLIC BISQUITS Like Red Lobster 's , served with a small side of watercress scrambled eggs
0	It 's super easy to make and THICK
0	FINGER LICKIN
0	MMMmmmm
0	PIONEER BRAND as the name says is A HOMESTYLE , AMERICAN CLASSIC
0	Nothing easier
0	Nothing better
0	Even beats grandmother 's white gravy recipe
0	Already peppered for you
0	You do nothing but mix it with water
0	Takes only a minute or two
0	I highly recommend this gravy mix
0	It will not disappoint
0	It is VERY easy to make and tastes great , also
0	Goes very well over mashed potatoes , meats , etc
0	Try it
0	I do n't think it equals fresh brewed but it is very acceptable
0	So you do n't have to do the math7   38   184 per single
0	Online price 27   114   236 shipping not calculated in
0	Looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier , you can get a case of 12 boxes for 69 , no sales tax and free shippingsounds like a great deal
0	12 x 19   228 singles so 69   228   302 per single   the most expensive at all
0	At work , we have a water cooler with hot water dispenser
0	This brewed in hot water just like a tea bag making tea tastes far better than any instant coffee
0	Best way to make iced coffee
0	I live in the dorms without a kitchen so making a cup of coffee was really easy with this
0	Its just like making tea and tastes decent enough
0	Not starbucks but good enough with some sugar and cream
0	I do n't particularly like instant coffee
0	vending machinesbr br Jerry
0	In this economy , no one wants to pay those high prices , so we started a coffee club
0	20 of us buy these coffee bags and separate creamer and enjoy fresh , hot , tasty coffee every day without paying the coffee shop prices
0	thanks Folgers
0	
0	This is the best tasting coffee
0	It 's easy to make without a mess
0	Fast , easy and definitely delicious
0	Makes a great cup of coffee and very easy to make
0	Good purchase
0	Will continue to order from herebr Thanx
0	It has a somewhat sweet and almost minty taste and a wonderful aroma
0	It has a nice reddish color
0	The flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity
0	The color is that of muddy water , and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well
0	Well worth every penny
0	I previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price
0	Both the quality and price are better than others that I have purchased for the same quantity
0	This is a great product for those looking for an MSG and Gluten free product , and is also lower sodium than any other marinade or soy sauce out there
0	I looked at the ingredients and was quite pleasedbr with the natural ingredients and no calories
0	This hot sauce is one of my favorites
0	Its a perfect balance of tasty and spicy
0	A mix of garlic , habanero , and other spices
0	I highly recommend this to anyone who likes hot sauce
0	The DJ
0	's were sampling the sauce and raving about it , So I picked up a bottle at the local grocery , It 's so good
0	I keep a bottle in the kitchen and an extra bottle on hand for gifts and for taking to potlucks , barbecues and party 's
0	This is my favorite hot sauce
0	I liketo use it to give anything some extra flavor
0	It 's hot , but not without flavor
0	I do n't like those sauces that just burn but have no taste
0	This has both burn and and awesome flavor
0	I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good hot sauce
0	I also love the pineapple
0	You will not go wrong ordering this up
0	This is my favorite hot sauce
0	Hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy
0	My favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far
0	Thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce
0	It goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kickbr br The sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears
0	It is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use
0	We love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice
0	absolutely love the habenaro sauceuse it on eggs , sandwiches most anything for a good kick
0	have watched the progessing popularity of theis homegrown producthave nothing but the highes accolades for the chef and the productget out there and try it
0	I in fact love the medium sauce the taste is so yummy with a bit of zing behind it
0	Kind of like a HIS   HERS package
0	Keep up the hard work
0	Man what can i say , this salsa is the bomb
0	i have all the different kinds
0	i have it with almost every meal
0	do nt sleep on this hot sauce
0	
0	this sauce is so good with just about anything , i like adding it to asian food or anything with egg or noodles , it has a good burn with a strong flavor
0	i m hoping to see some of the other flavors like the pineapple experiment on here soon
0	buy it you wo nt regret it
0	Not hot at all
0	Like the other low star reviewer , I got suckered by seeing ' habenero ' in the name and the 12 oz size
0	Some people might like the flavor , citrusy and it has some fish sauce in the mix according to the ingredient label , but if you 're looking for hot this ai n't it
