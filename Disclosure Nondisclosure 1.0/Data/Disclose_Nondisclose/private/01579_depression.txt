I have been on lexapro for almost 10 years and it has worked great at 10 mg dose. No, problems at all. About a year ago I started having ibs so I started taking loperamide immodiun,ad. I was at one time,taking up to 40,per day. I read how addicting they can be so,i have tapered down to 20 a day. Not a big problem there. Everything was fine, but the last 3 weeks i started drinking a lot of energy drinks. It's been a week since I have not been on them. About 3 or 4 days ago, I started having anxiety and depression, and it has gotten worse. Went to my doc, who thought I was just getting worse didn't say anything about the drinks. Also prescribed trazadone, which i, have done 1 night. Before i went in to see him i felt like I was having out of body experience and he didn't say much to,it. He is a great doc. I guess I just want to know has anyone had problems like this with energy drinks. Also I would drink a protein drink afterward I worked out. I am,driving my wife crazy and cry a lot and feel like I am not here sometimes. Someone please help...
