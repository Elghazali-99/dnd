I get so depressed I will attempt suicide everyday I will also hurt my self e.g burn myself and cut myself I use knives to cut and lighters to burn. I constantly think of suicide it never leaves my mind I already see a psychiatrist and a psychotherapist bit either of them work it kinda makes me angry because I never remember what we talk about in the appointments It takes me 5-10 minutes to remember something sometimes I will remember things. This is my biggest confusion about my mind and need to know what this is Buckle Up! here it goes: I argue with my self in my head, I laugh alot for no reason, I see insects that are there but then they dissapear, I think aliens are talking to me and they wanna work with me, the aliens are helping me to commit suicide, God is working along with them and me, together we can save the world, I think i have super powers like i think i can lift a car i think i can make things magically happen, I have big thoughts of becomming the best serial killer little tiny voices expload in my ears when i try to sleep. What is going on with me?
