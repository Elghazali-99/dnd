I have a friend that i am begining to be concerned with. He's battled depression and had thoughts of suicide in the past. Now I think hes on Colozopan *if thats the antipsycotic, and something else that i  can't remember the name of.  Hes a 23 year old male from a happy home.  for this senario we will call him Jed.
 The past month or so Jed has been behaving differently around his friends and coworkers. He comes into work thinking that everyone is against him and that he doesn't fit in. This isn't true Jed has known the people that he works with for over 7 years and we have all been good friends. Today Jed did something that really worried me though. He came into work and confronted his long time friend and coworker Jack and told Jack that he thought of him as a father and he doesn't want Jack to have anything to do with anyone else. Jack is currently helping another friend Jim who is having a run of bad luck and is letting Jim stay with Jack and his wife Jill. Jed begins to cry and admits that he wants Jim to die and that he hates Jim. (now Jed and Jim have no past and have had no conflicts)(another note, I've known Jed for over 10 years and Jed has never been a violent person and has never said that about anyone).
 After crying on and off in the conversation for a couple hours we got in the car and decided to go to lunch. Jed starting talking to Jim and basically  seemed to go back to normal.
 I can't get him to get help on  his own and Jed's family doesn't seem to take me serious because I don't know if he has anything, but I'm pretty sure that wasn't normal today.
 Any input you can throw my way I will appreciate greatly.
 Thanks, a concerned friend
