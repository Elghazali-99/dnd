Hi all
 If you read my other questions you may know reasons I am posting something on here.
 I have become really depressed,
 Many factors now.
 mainly money issues but health and other possible reasons to go into effect.
 The scare with HIV is over as been more or less proven it is not.
jsut feeling very tired, legs hurt.
 just have no energy when I got nothing to do, when I am at work I have to keep my self from being bored.
 blood test was done and got low red blood cells,
I was suffering from major anxiety about the scare which as now been proven it is not.
 I know the main reason which is money, but my fault I have booked a holiday which I can not really afford, but as its only 3 months a way and if I cancel I will lose a lot of money.
 but also few other issues involved. 
 Just wondering
 if feeling really down 
like I for no energy, and basically can not be botered can be solved or should I go to doctors, to be fair I do not want to go on tablets, 
is they any other way to get this energy back and feel better than go on tablets, and what has everyone else done to help solve this issue?
