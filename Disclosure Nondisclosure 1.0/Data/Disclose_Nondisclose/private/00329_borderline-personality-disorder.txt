wow... I wish I'd known about this mental condition during my 1 year relationship, which ended 2 months ago. My "ex" is 52, handsome, intelligent and he manifests many of the symptoms describing BPD... especially, the anger and
irritability issues. He had described a childhood filled with chaos & conflict... physical & emotional neglect; physical abuse; feelings of being unloved & unwanted (abandonment); an alcoholic mother; a philandering father... etc. He has a history of "cutting" people out of his life when relationships go sour or "not his way." He's been married & divorced twice with no contact with the ex's (which is, maybe, understandable); will not talk to his sister; doesn't talk to his father; has no contact with his 4 children; nor with his grandchildren. And, is currently living with the mother who he
claims to "hate" and blames for much of his past trauma. Since our break-up (which he initiated), he has not contacted me. Admittedly, our relationship ended under semi-amicable terms. However, I'd like to "take the high road" and extend an "olive branch" of friendship as I am concerned for his mental well being; and would like to be a support to him. 
Is it advisable, or even possible, to maintain friendships with such individuals? 
Or, should I avoid this "stick of dynamite?" ... and leave well enough alone.
Oh, he was a "bed-wetter" in his youth... is that consistent with the BPD childhood history?
