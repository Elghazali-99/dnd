I happened upon this site doing some research to find out what I now have in store for me! For months I was having MAJOR cramps that no matter what test they did nobody could figure out why so my OB decided to try a partial hysterectomy using the da vinci robotic. She left just my ovaries so I wouldn't go into menopause. Well, it didn't work. I never stopped hurting. That was in Oct. Finally in Dec. she gave me the depo shot which would tell us if it was the ovaries causing the pain (if it made the pain stop we found the issue, if it didn't work I would be send to a new specialist) It worked!!! For the 1st time in 7 months I had NO pain! So, I am now waiting for my overies to be scheduled to be removed ... I am a little nervouse as I am 35 and will be sent into surgical menopause! I am also a smoker so they won't giveme any hormonal replacements or anything like that. My mommy knows some of what I can do for this as she was a smoker when she hit menopause so that calms me some but I have read some horror stories .... what kinds of things did you go through after a complete hysterectomy and did you use hormones? Thank you,
