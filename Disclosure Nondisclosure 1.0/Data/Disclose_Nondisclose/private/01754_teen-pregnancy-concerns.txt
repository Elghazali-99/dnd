Hi there:
 I am not sure whether this question should be asked here. But anyway, here I go.
I have a habit of masturbating in the bathroom while bathing. Usually, most of the sperm simply drop on the floor while some are on my hand and body. Although I try my best to make sure all sperm are wiped off, I am not sure if any of the sperm could remain on other areas in the bathroom (e.g. I touch something else in the bathroom after I wash my hand).
 Therefore, I have a few questions in this regard:
1. How long can sperm live in a bathroom area (the sperm is very likely to have contact with soap or other chemical)?
2. Can sperm live outside of semen (sorry, my concept of sperm and semen is very poor)?
3. How likely is sperm attach on a surface (e.g. a hand)?
3. A more specific question, since I share the bathroom with my family (including my mum and aunt who are over 40), is there any possibility that they get pregnant if they touch some contaminated areas (e.g. I touch those areas after masturbating), bath and somehow the water get the sperm (I assume that sperm will attach on their hands if they touch the contaminated areas) to their vagina or if they touch their vagina straight?
 I am very anxious about this and I would really appreciate some reliable medical information and advice. Probably the worse is that I cannot get my mum to do a pregnant test because I masturbate in the bathroom, so I have to figure everything by myself.
 Many thanks
