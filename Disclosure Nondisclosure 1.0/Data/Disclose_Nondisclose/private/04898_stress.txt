I've  been going through a lot of stressful situations lately, but I don't  seem to have mental issues, just physical issues. I feel sick most of the time and I  have no appetite  at all. I eat only because I  have to and after I  usually feel sick. Sometimes I feel random episodes of pain on random parts of my abdomen that come at random times and last for some time and then never come back. I have no trouble falling asleep but I wake up in the middle of the night almost every day, between 2-5 am and I  can't  get to sleep after that at all, no matter what I  do. Sometimes when I  wake up I  get a massive headache  that then lasts for the rest of the day. I give up on easy tasks that I  could usually do without a problem because I'm  so fatigued. Although i think this might be due to the lack of sleep.
I  have a lot of  exams coming  up and revision and grades don't  really worry me. Could I  still be stressed but without really knowing it? Is this caused by stress or something else? I have a feeling my friends, who are extremely stressed right now, could have passed some of it onto me. My teachers or parents or anyone aren't  doing anything to make it better (they're actually making it worse), and I  don't  have time for relaxing at all to reduce this possible stress. 
Can someone help, please?
