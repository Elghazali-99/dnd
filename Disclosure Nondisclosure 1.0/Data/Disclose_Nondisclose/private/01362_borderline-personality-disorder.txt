Hi Dr, 5 months ago i was in a chemical lab about to start work on a Gas Chromatography Mass spec when i fell extremely ill. I am still unwell and have being to a number of GPs and Consultants and Mental health clinic, but with no answers. I am waiting on an appointment to see a neurologist. My symtoms are as follows, dizzness, slightly disorianted, vomiting (the first few weeks), difficulties in breathing, spaced out feeling, foggy brain, my preception of my surroundings has not being the same since that day, its like iam in a dream state. I also have concentration problems, tingling in hands and feet, slight numness in my head. In the first few weeks i have flu like symtoms. I am still suffuring from fatigue, weekness. I also have had aggresive taughts, about hurting family menbers and friends. Do you think my symtoms are related to the chemical lab? I hope you can help me on this matter, like advice on who should i see in the medical department. I have asked the college what chemicals i could have being exposed to but they said none, so i dont know what to do can you help me please
 Regards 
 Ken
