I have another post up about abuse support, but if u read the other one it was about a boy in my class who was asking me out non- stop and he touched my leg. I thought that i got him to stop asking me out, i guess i didnt because the past week he had asked me out and i just said " Yes i will go out with you" but then at the end of last week i said i cant do this, i dont want a boy friend i am glad you had a try with me but its just not going to work.!! Well He stoped for a couple of days, and today while my class was coming back from the field trip ( ESY) it was only him and me in one van but he bought me a gift trying to get me to say " Awww its sooo nice" and i guess he thought we were going out and he moved next to me and i moved away a bit since i was sitting on the out side set. and he moved over again and next thing i know he put his hand on my leg then he started rubbing it, i got all tense and i couldnt speak, he than started moving his hand backwards and up my back, then started moving down i whispered and said stop, i am telling you to stop" he didnt leson he put his hand down my pants and started rubbing my ***. Please tell me if this is considered sexual harresment? Or what it is considered? I dont know what to do i am getting really upset about this because of something that had happend to my ex and i 8 months ago!!!
