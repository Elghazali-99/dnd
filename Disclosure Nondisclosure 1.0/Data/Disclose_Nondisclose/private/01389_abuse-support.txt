Wow its amazing what the economy can reveal. I am 17 and found out this shocking truth. Its been some tough 
 times my father was barely able to pay the bills. He had to borrow money from my mother. This is when the 
 confession happen. My mother confronted him on why he has no money and why he was acting so wierdly. I 
 thought he was secretly paying child support. But it turned out he was spending 20 dollars per day on Roxicet pills
  and he didnt have any money for them today. He is going through withdraw. Hes having serious diarea and 
 drowsiness. I read on the withdraw and I am not worried about his symptoms because they are not life threatening. 
 I want to know if its safe to cut off the drugs forever. Every where I look people say the choke down the drug day by
  day to withdraw. But my father doesnt get it over the counter if you know what I mean. My father isnt a bad person 
 he problily came accross it because of his back pain. The guy across the street was giving it to him for free 
 because he also had back issues and was prescribed the drug from the doctor. But to put it all in a nut shell.
  Can my dad cut off the drug or does he need to slowly withdraw from it ?(which I am not a supporter of)
