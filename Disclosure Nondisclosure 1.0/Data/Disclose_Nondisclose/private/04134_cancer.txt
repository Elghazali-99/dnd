I have a pea size lump in the neck, showed to the Doctor and she sent me for an ultrasound, mainly because I had shoulder pain. 
The scan revealed an Hypoechoic image of 10 by 5mm in the supraespinatus compatible with tendonitis. and a non-especific supraclavicular ganglion of 9.6mm. 
My Doctor said the ganglion could be because of the tendonitis and she didn't think much of it. When I question her about lymphoma she said it could be but is like saying that every headache is a brain tumor. In the net they mention that this could be a sign of cancer (lymphoma, cancer of the lung or throat) why my Doctor didn't send me for a biopsy of the lump just to be in the safe side. 
I went to a second Doctor and she could hardly feel it and said no to worry about it that the lump it's too small. I don't know what to do. It's not that I don't trust them but I have been reading in Forums that people had lumps and the Doctor's dismiss them and it turned out it was lymphoma.  I keep thinking  that with cancer the longer you leave it unattended the more difficult it is to treat. Could someone advise me about what to do? How long does Lymphoma takes to progress to dangerous stages? Thank you.
