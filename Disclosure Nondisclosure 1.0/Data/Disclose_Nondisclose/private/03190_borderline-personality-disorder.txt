My husband is retired after 21 years active duty military. He did well with a structured life. He retired 7 years ago. Since retirement he has been getting continuously more aggressive & mean. # years ago he stared to steal things from ourr house,blankets linens,my rare gemstone collection,antique china,my diamond rings. He stole from his job to the tune of $10,000 worth of stuff. He said he deserved it because they didnt pay him enough. He has since quit the job after getting into it with the boss. He is in constant need of attention,he acts like a child,pretends to fall down & gets very angry if I dont come to his rescue. He goes from doctor to doctor,but never does what they tell him. His mother is the same way.
He gets angry when I aske him where all my stuff is,he says ::I misplaced it"" an entire household of goods. He is verbally abusive,mentally abusive. I have had to call the sheriff on him too. He has a whole arsonal of self torture devices,a mini butanne torch,knives{which he will resharpen} to cut himself,nail clippers.
Is this a behavior or a mental illness.
I should also tell you he takes adderal and effexor xl 350.He admits to being depressed.He only seems happy when there is constant chaos in the household. After 25 years I dont know if I can do this anymore.
