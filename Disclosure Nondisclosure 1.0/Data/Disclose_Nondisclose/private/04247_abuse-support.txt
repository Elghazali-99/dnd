It's about my past 
Please don't judge and I am just telling you what happen and I had experienced
The molestation started when I was either four or five and my nephew, her used to touch me up that sort of way, between that time he used to kick, punch or slap me and it continued for three years, from then onward I have always been sick to my stomach, I had gained a lot of weight since then.
Last year I star having a lot of bad dreams and some really good ones 
I will tell you everything that happen in the dreams after this
After my grandad die, I had stopped having my period and I told myself it's just stress related 
And the dreams were still coming
In between the whole I can not speak time, I had one period that was in April and after that I had none but stomach had began to get bigger, I felt more nauseated than before, my boobs were always sore, I had alot cramping and shoulder pain and I was always tired
One day I woke up at five am with pain in my stomach, the pain worst than my normal period pains, at one time I thought I was being stabbed will a knife, another time I thought I was being ripped apart but after an half later the pain began to fade away
I mostly laid down in my bed and cried and later on that day the pain came in waves and told a friend what was happening to 
We continued talking about it and we came to the conclusion that I was  pregnant
After that day I told myself 
Ok im pregnant
As the weeks flew by my stomach had gotten bigger, I had a lot pain, I had nightmares, I had dreams were I was in labor, after labor, playing with a baby girl and even cuddling with her 
During those weeks, I had told a friend about everything and we named whatever that was in my tummy Angel and everyday I would rub my tummy, sleep, drink  and eat, at five I would go to sleep and get back up at seven and do it all over again
Til one day I was home and started having this really bad pain in my stomach but I ignored it, later around nine and ten in the time
I had urge to push and began pushing for some reason, after a half of a hour pushing I decided to stop 
At 20-24 weeks I woke up and I had the most excruciating if ever had so I got up and used the bathroom and as I was going to flush the toilet, I saw to little feet in the bowl covered in blood
I stood there in shocked because I thought I was losing my mind
Then I saw this white thing dangling from me so I pulled it out  and more blood came  out then I flushed the toilet cause I didn't want no one to know what had happen to me. After that I went into my bedroom and cried.
Last december I still had those nightmares then an evening  I was in my bed and my nephew saw and he told my mother. That night I told my mother about my molestation and she said it was child play 
 What should I do?
