I have had a traceable tumor for 12 yrs, in that time it has gone from 3.2cm to 4cm
I don't know when it started. It stained for cd117 but I have no symptoms and am 
in good health. It scanned at 4cm in 2010 and has stayed at that. I have heard that some
malignant cancers get to a mutation point and stop mutating. So again it has not grown in 
5yrs. The doctors want to cut me and take it out. I don't want to do that,  
So I also have hep c and they are blocking the Harvoni until the gist is addressed. I might
add that the surgeon at first did not want to operate because there are to many veins 
around the tumor, so he sent me to an oncology Dr for imatinib. The oncology Dr sent
me back to  general surgery. I have yet to see him. Either way I think it is better to deal
with the Hep C first. They have recently spotted a lesion on the liver. The panel 7 is
pretty good with just a few out of range. I have heard the Harvoni is about 90% fixable.
Just wondering what someone else is thinking about this
 Thx for reading
