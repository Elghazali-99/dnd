Okay so im 13. My friends got distant.  Then we moved.   I didnt want to.  Then i was being teased and put down.  Then i was diagnosed with Marfans Syndrome.  My parents started fighting.  And my stepdad was diagnosed with servre depression.   Anyways.  I started cutting (i know bad) when we moved a year ago.  First time i did it was to be "cool" and to have a heart scar on my ankle.  But then after a while.  I started doing it.  Then i stopped.  I never cut my wrist.  Till about a month ago.  I fell into depression.  I cant sleep. I started crying (i didnt really ever cry) every night.    I started cutting my wrist.  I hid it.  My parents never noticed me cutting.  Or when i lie about being okay.  I used to be a clean freak.  Now i cant get myself to clean.   I hate not doing my homework. But i cant anymore.  I loved reading drawing taking pictures.   Dont really do them anymore.  (i dont know if im doing this right sorry.  Plus i might get distracted stuck in a car listening to my mom yell at my step dad over the phone) anyways.  So is there a way to get out of this.  A way to.   Idk feel better.  Sorry about the spelling and main point.  Thanks
