I've been divorced for quiet a long while now. Since the separation my now ex-husband has never been able to talk to me in a good manner. He's always spoken to me with hate/anger. I've never really understood why if he chose to be with someone else. All I did was  accept my reality and filed for divorce. My 15 yr old daughter has found it real hard to deal with the fact he's not with us. He moved on fairly quick,remarried soon after the divorce became final. He married lady he was having an affair with. Recently my daughter talked to him,she let him know what she wanted of him. One of those things was for him to be able to talk to me as a person. He admitted to her he felt to much anger towards me. for the life he lived when he was with me. I can honestly say I was surprised. Sounds to me he still living in the past. When in reality he should of left our past behind the day he decided to unite his life with his wife. My daughter feels I should try to talk to him. I very much disagree, I know we share in common our children. Other than that there's no reason why to bring up our past just to sooth his ego, so he could feel better. I don't feel I should as it doesn't involve our kids. I'm unsure about what I should do. I understand what my daughter wants but it's all on his part. Any suggestions would be great. Thanks before hand.
