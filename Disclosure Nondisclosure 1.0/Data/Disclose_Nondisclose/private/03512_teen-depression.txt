I don't know if i have a certain disorder or if i'm just plain crazy ,but i checked, and i have a symptom from at least every disorder i looked at. A year ago i started having really ****** up thoughts about suicide and how meaningless my life was and i even cut myself enough to bleed out until i felt extremely weak and slept for full days. Eventually i started self-medicating... heavily. It turned into an addiction that i still struggle with, and also a sick game i play with myself (how many amitryptaline pills can i take before passing out in the middle of math class and then sleeping for 20 hours straight? Go ahead, ask me. i kept count). I also have certain "highs and lows" that last anywhere from a couple of  minuites to days. For example i could be practically bouncing off the walls and literally shaking one day, and not talking to anybody and trying to overdose on vicodin the next. This caused me to lose many freinds over the years and now i have none. no contact with the outside world. And that definatelly doesn't help. I also have an extremely grandious view of myself. I see myself as the greatest human being that is better than everyone  else. It's a warped view, i know that much. But i still see it that way. I laugh at the pain of others to a horrifying extent. I'm a terrible human being that doesn't deserve to live. But at least i'm trying to get help. I haven't been to a doctor and my parents know none of this (i'm ridiculously good at fooling people into thinking everythings ok. I could probably convice a bank teller to give me all their money. maybe thats a slight exagerration... very slight). Does anyone know what the **** is going on? Do i have ADHD, BPD, APD, ABCDEFG? I need to know, or i just might just screw up enough to actually want to die.
