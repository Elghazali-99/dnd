My whole life I have been A shell full of emotions but shut down by anyone I have ever felt close to. My dad has anger issues and I have developed them over time. My mother tells me to shut up before I actually even speak. My sister tells me it's my fault they do this. I haven't been able to have any deep connections with anyone since I was little. My whole life I wanted to get away from my family and now that I am seventeen and about to, I realize I have no life and nowhere to go. I always thought about a having a family of my own sometime down the road but I seem incapable of having a long standing relationship with somebody. Also I have hated my father throughout my entire childhood, and I wanted to be nothing like him and today I just came to realize that everything I do is like him. I can't put another child through that. Also I was planning to go to college but I now know that I have no desire to be an engineer (what I was planning to become) and I have no idea what to do with my life. Where do I go from here?
