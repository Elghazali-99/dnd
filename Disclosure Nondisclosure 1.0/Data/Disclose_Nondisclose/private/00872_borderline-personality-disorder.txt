Dear Sir/Madam,
 It's been more than a year now since I have lost my sense of being (unable to feel the aliveness in me). What should I do? I am 22 years old. I am 40kg, that is not healthy, what is wrong with my health? Does it have anything to do with my mental health? I have been keep telling myself to live for my purpose, which is to achieve academic excellence, I do hang out sometimes, and tell myself to keep on going in my life. I doesn't have love around me, is that a problem? I am picky at friendships, only spend more time with people whom I find kind, intelligent, and learning, don't really have any particular friend whom I meet frequently, but a few we mail each other. And I don't spend time with people I find playful and doesn't even know what they want to do in life. I doesn't have my parents, I was brought up by my mother, she was a single mother, but she has passed away when I was 11. Eversince then I have been living with my step sister. Me and my stepsister has very seldom talk, and she doesn't even know what was I doing, how I have grow mentally, but she would cook for me sometimes and buy me birthday present, we have different skin tone, and that makes me feel very different when I'm with them. I am a mixture of Chinese and Indian. She was a Chinese. I was sad coming from such family background that I never feel and understand how a healthy family is, but all the while the positive people I met tells me how valuable life is and to keep me motivated. I feel stressful at times living with my sister, because we doesn't talk, and I need room for making progressment in life, which is by next year, for now I feel like I am stretching myself to live in this environment and I doesn't like my country too, I am planning to leave just once I have completed my studies. I organize my studies, my sister doesn't help me.
 Can you tell what is my problem?
