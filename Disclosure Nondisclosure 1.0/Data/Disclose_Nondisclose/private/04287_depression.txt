I've been on some form of antidepressant since I was 16 (11 years running now).  They started me on zoloft, then prozac, then lexapro, then back to zoloft at a higher dosage.  Then around 7 years ago I started getting panic attacks, so they put me on some benzos along with cymbalta and abilify.  Cymbalta was the worst drug I'd ever been on; I felt like a walking zombie... not depressed, just not anything at all.  I've been through three or four different talk therapists and a handful of psychiatrists.  I've given up on both due to their lack of ability to listen (anyone else notice that?).  I now just receive my rxs from my GP, which is fine... but I am now on the maximum dosage for zoloft of 200 mg a day and it is a struggle to leave my bed in the morning.  It's taking its toll on my marriage, on my relationships with friends (everybody just stopped calling) and my family.  They want to help, but they just can't seem to understand that I am always miserable and I hate myself and everything I've ever done.  I am unable to see anything productive or useful I have ever done and I don't see the point of going on like this.  I love my wife and children (1 girl, 1 on the way)  which is the only thing keeping me on this earth.  I guess my question is... What the hell is the next step?  Do I go back to trying to shuffle meds till something works?  Do I just give up and try to drudge on in misery?  Have I been misdiagnosed somehow and do I somehow have a more serious disorder?  Please, someone give me some insight.
