Hi
Need some advise on how to deal with this situation. I have an 8yr old in my first marriage and now my second husband and i have a 2 yr old together.
From the begining my son and him have not get along very well. My second husband is very demanding and strict with my son. He also teases my son a lot which i demanded him to stop everytime he does!
Still has continued after 3 yrs marriage! 
Yesterday my husband was watching tv and my son asked if he could see something else. My husband told him he ia the parent so makes the rules! My son got mad and hit my husband on the arm, then my husband grabbed my son by the neck and told him not to touch him ever again!
I am still in total shock! How can he grab my son by the neck! I dont even want to tell my family about it causw they will kick hom out of here in two minutes!
I sat both of them on the couch and tild them to say sorry and never do this again! 
But deep inside i still feel this is abuse and violence against my son and i want to know if i should report it to police or what should i do???
Pls help!
