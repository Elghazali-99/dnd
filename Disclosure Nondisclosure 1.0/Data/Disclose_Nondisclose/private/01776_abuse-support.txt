After going through analytical therapy about five years ago i realised i had been abused as a child i always knew it in my head but never told anyone, it was touching so i didn't accept it as abuse but now i realise it was, i find this very hard to deal with. I left the therapy i couldn't talk about it and i went into cbt therapy for panic attacks and anxiety i also have ocd and argraphobia and PTSD, i wondered is it possible that all there disorders could have been caused because of that abuse. I have recently been diagonised with depression as well. Growing up there was no love shown to me as a child i ended up getting pregnant at sixteen to an abusive partner who then tried to kill me. I have struggled on with my life but now at 34 i have attempted suicide twice in the past six months and my therapist says i have changed and i am unpredictable. My family aren't speaking to me now because of the suicide attempts but i have my partner and my children, my partner is good although he can be abusive at times, i wonder why me, i feel like i am stuck and suicide is my answer, could child abuse only touching really cause all this pain.
