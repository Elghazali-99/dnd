I have been having thoughts about killing myself but the only thing that has been stopping me I thing is the thoughts of will it hurt.  No one really sees what I'm going through I've been watching loved ones die left and right and here resently I lost my papa and I took it real hard. I'm still taking it hard I keep thinking why didn't I spin more time with him, did I say I love you enough, or if I said it at all. No one knows I'm still hurting. I've been doing all I can to not show how hurt I really am. I hang out with my friends but they don't know how I really feel. I've been pissing my parents off because I don't feel like doing anymore I don't want to go to school anymore, I could care less if I hang out with my friends. I just wanna. Be left alone. I'm not a bad kid I don't mean to **** people off but in the last 10 years or so I just haven't vented or talked about any of my problems I just keep them inside me thinking they will go away. I don't know who I can talk to about these things, I've tried to find religion so I can have something to believe in but in truth I can't grasp the concept of a god. It's not like I haven't tried to talk to the school counselor or principal I just feel awquard and talk about something else. I just want to feel normal and I feel like the only way I will truly feel normal is if I die but I'm scared to do anything because of the lingering feeling of will it hurt.
