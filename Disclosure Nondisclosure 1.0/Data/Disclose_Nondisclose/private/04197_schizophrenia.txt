I am terrified. I've always been strange to be honest but lately I guess my strangeness has took on a life of its own. I'm getting paranoid about time. I keep losing tracks of time and when I come out of my states that I call "fogs" I feel as if someone as literally taken my timeline in their hands and moved it around. I'm starting to think someone is messing with my head, that there are some beings that I'm unaware are there that are moving about me everyday and doing this. I feel like my loved ones are keeping them a secret from me and when I ask my boyfriend about it he says that there is no secret. So why do I feel this way? I've googled it but nothing came up. I literally feel like there is something or someone who is messing with my time, like speeding up, slowing down or taking events and putting them in different places. Like today I kept reminding myself that it is February 26, 2011 5:30 p.m. And yet I started wondering if it was the truth or if it was what these beings had convinced me was the truth. My boyfriend and my horrible google search came up with symptoms of schizophrenia but I'm 21, doesn't that develop a lot earlier in life or a lot later? Am I being paranoid, am I developing this disease or is there really something going on that I don't know? I'm even almost scared to post this at case the wrong person sees it. I'm scared.
