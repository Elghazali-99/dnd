My husband and I got married when I was 19 and he was 31. We have 2 boys together and we have lost a daughter years ago. We have been married for 8 years now. He spent a one year stent in prison and I cheated on him after being married for 8 months. We moved on from that and year before last we were having problems so he moved out only temporary. We have both had infidelities in the past. Soon after that he got a good job offer 6 hours away that he took. He has been gone for over a year now and I see him every other weekend when he gets the boys. I am still very much in love with him and want him back. I have expressed my feelings to him hundreds of times over the year and he doesn't care. He is at the bar every night with his new gf who is 20 yrs younger than him and her parents are loaded. I was devestated yesterday when he told me our marriage was a mistake. I don't know how to go on. My two boys are the only reason I am alive. It is getting harder to function everyday. I thought he would always be there for me. I need some help as to what to do we are still married and I am losing it.
