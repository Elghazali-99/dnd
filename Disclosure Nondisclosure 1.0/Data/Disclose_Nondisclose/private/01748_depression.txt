I am taking Paxil (for depression) 10mg daily, along with Carbidopa/Levodopa (for Parkinsons) and Propranolol (for other Parkinsons related issues). I am wanting to take the Fitmiss Burn (fat burner), Fitmiss Tone (CLA), Fitmiss Z-Slim PM (Sleep aid and Metabolic booster) and Fitmiss Balance (multi-vitamin). obviously they all have tons of different ingredients but they are simple to find online. If anyone is willing to look that knows about medicinal interactions I would greatly appreciate it. I have done other research on the products and they are all pretty good. I have also used one of the other products (Fitmiss Ignite) and have had no side effects except that it gave me the exact level of energy I needed at the time I needed it, no crash, no headache, no bathroom rush lol. I just wanna know it won't kill me if I combine all these. If you all can't answer, does anyone know who can? My doctors don't always have a huge pharmacology background especially when it comes to these alternative products so they are not usually much help. Thanks Guys!!!!!
