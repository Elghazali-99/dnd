I don't know if I am officially in menopause yet. I am 51 and taking birth control pills still. I start the bc pill on a Sunday and go off of it on a Sunday and my period doesn't start until Wednesday and it is light and ends on Saturday or Sunday. My family practice doctor does all my pelvic exams and so forth so I've never been to a gynecologist. He said to go off the pill the week I have my period (which I do anyway) and take my blood for FSH on Monday before I start my birth control. I have taken the FSH that day and he said it isn't high enough to call it menopause yet.. 
1. Is being off the week of being off the pill is long enough to tell if the FSH is correct?
2. My fingernails have started peeling badly the last two months.
3. I got frozen shoulder in my right arm about 6 months ago, could this be related?
4. I got hypothyroid about 6 months ago, can this be related?
5. I get hot but don't sweat then regular temp but isn't drastic.  
6. I get night sweats sometimes where I have to up and change my shirt. 
7. I got vertigo starting about a year ago but it is severe and my neurologist things it is related to my migraines or to my thyroid or both.
8. I can't lose weight which is very unusual for me. I have always been thin and now  I am not.
9. My husband says I don't have mood swings.
Any suggesitons as to what to do about the peeling fingernails, the frozen shoulder and its relations to esterogen?
I don't have breast cancer in the family. But I don't know my dads side of the family. He died of colon cancer at 47 and I never got to know him or his family.
10. I have low back pain which I have had for 3 years. I have osteoarthritis but this was from an injury.
11. If I can find out if I am in menopause would a short term of Estrogen therapy help my frozen shoulder and other symptoms. Or, is it worth the risk since I feel pretty good.
Thanks,
