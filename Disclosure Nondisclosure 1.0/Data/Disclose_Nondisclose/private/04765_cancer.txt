i want to know if i should be concerned with a positive smudge cells in my blood test result..
last year..during my CXR my doctor told me that i have a cyst on my chest,,i undergo CT scan and biopsy the doctor told me that its a benign cyst(fungal cyst) so nothing to worry..but i noticed that my platelet is too low it 114 and my WBC is about 20 and as time gone by my platelet became 84 and my WBC is now 17.5..my RDW is16 (normal is:11.5-14.5)..even my lymphocyte and monocyte is high..im 45 years old..since i undergo in to biopsy and they remove the cyst on my lungs i experienced cough and runny nose in the morning..my doctor told me that ill be on chemotherapy once every 3 weeks for 4 months.. i want to know if what is my prognosis as you view it..
