I have a 9month old baby with my partner and he has a 9yr old son with his ex. When my partner and met 4 yrs ago we was happy and touchy with each other. But during my pregnancy our relationship has driffted. Hes more dependant on his 9yr old and still treats him like a baby. His 9yr old has black teeth due to the fact my partner and his ex only give the child sugary drinks ans the child will only eat pizza or spaghetti with tomato sauce and he wont try different foods. When i bring up the subject to my partner on his sons health and eating habits he gets mad at me. We only see son every weekend. I feed my baby all kinds of different foods and daily wash her gums at night. And at times i feel when my partner holds our baby he begins to moan af her like he has no patience with a baby but hes not like this with his son. And its making me so depressed now. I really dont want to be a single mum but everytime i try to talk to him he simple does face gestures and says dont start. We dont have a sex life no more either. Sometimes i feel he regrets leaving his ex. They split 2 yrs before i met him. He bearly helps me at home and hes always either watcging football or playing games on his mobile.
