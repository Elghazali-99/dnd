My nephew is almost 3 and we feel he is being sexually abused.  My dad and his wife are staying with a man that abused me as a child.  He has been wetting the bed, playing "games" with the dolls, playing with himself until he is hard and won't stop, he has nightmares where he says he is scared of an ugly man, and he has also been playing with his "bottom" a lot.  I am most certainly concerned but we don't know how to ask him about it.  How do we find out who it is for sure?  I don't know what questions to ask to get an answer out of him.  We have asked where he has learned that game from (taking the dolls clothes off and getting on top of it) and he won't answer he just asks if he is going to get in trouble.  Of course we don't spank him or anything because we want to gain his trust for him to know that he can talk about it.  I don't want him growing up the way i did.  Please someone help me.  I need to know what to ask him.  Like certain words or how to phrase the question.
