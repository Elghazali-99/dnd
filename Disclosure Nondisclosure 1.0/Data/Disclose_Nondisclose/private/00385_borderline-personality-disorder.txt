Hi all, I am new here, I have a question that will need some back ground. 
I have a brother who was diagnosed with BPD, he is either licking your boots or spitting venom at you. 
He has never had a relation ship with any one and can only report, he will call me twice a week and tell me what scores he got on his test at college. He is now in this relationship with a woman who is recently divorced and has two children, She is devout Baptist,and keeps trying to convert him, We went to visit our other brother last month in SC and our sister in law said fu$k in the car on the way to dinner, he yelled "if you ever say anything like that in front of Donna I will kick your *** back to SC" This is how he treats people on every level of talking to them. 
My question is how to deal with him, he called me to report and started to go on about how donnas father was coming for dinner and because he is going to vote for obama,and her father is not, she told him not to talk about the issue. 
I simply said " how old is this man? can't he have a discussion with someone on a topic he does not agree with? He went off, and so did I unloading several years of looking the other way on him. 
Not sure how to deal with the situation.
