I'm 17 years of age, 18 in less than two weeks. Anyway, since I can remember I have always had a short fuse, a bad temper. Around my early teens it all started, I became aggressive and started shouting frequently, throwing furniture around and destroying my room. Since then, it takes only something small to set me off, and when I get going I go mental. Recently, my "mate" was being racist to me, I took it maliciously, and ran after him. Pinned him up against the wall, threw him and shouted at him and told him not to say it again. I was so close to punching him in the face or putting his head through the school window. Two years ago, I head butted my other "mate" because he called me a "Criminal" and kept on provoking me. I have thrown a bedside table at my mother, threw a clock at my dad, almost came close to punching him in the face because he disrespected me and told me to "shut up". My mum used to shout at me continuously since I was little and used to hit me, now I do the same. Even when having an argument and I disagree with the points being expressed I get angry and start getting irritated. Also, I'm impulsive and explosive? I don't think about what I'm doing, I don't think about why I shouldn't act aggressively, I just act on impulse and instinct. If I just sit there and take the abuse or comments, I feel weak and feel like people can walk all over me. At least through violence my statement is put forward. Also, my real father was a wife beater and used to hit my mum, I have never met him. It seems when I get angry or if someone provokes me I think about all of the pain and upsetting thoughts and take it out on that person or thing. Sometime I'm close to tears. I can't seem to control my anger, I get angry easily over nothing and I don't care what I'm doing whilst I'm angry. After I have hit someone or unleashed my anger everything is fine and I go back to normal, like nothing has happened. Please can someone help me?
