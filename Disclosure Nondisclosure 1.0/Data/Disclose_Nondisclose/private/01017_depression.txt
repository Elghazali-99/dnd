Im looking for advice/experience anyone has adding abilify to there current anti depressant.Im asking for bith myself and my husband.He takes 50mg if zoloft&refuses2take more because@100 he experiences serious sexual side effects&doesnt want2switch to a different kind of primary A.D. I take300mg of effexor XR.We both feel like the meds we r taking r helpong to keep us out of a severely depresse state but know we can feel better.As for me I dont want to up my effexor dose for a few reasons mainly because Im on a high dose,if I miss it by just a couple hours I feel awful&dnt think a higher dose will make a difference.Ive read(google)that abilify gets u2that point where u should feel normal.I have become sort of sedate.I have trouble sleeping but when I finally do I will sleep for long spans of time,I have a big issue w/going out2socialize etc.Ive read it helps with that.Does anyone have experience w/abilify.I really think my husband should try a different med instead of zoloft as his dose is so low but he refuses.This is more about me(he doesnt have sleep issues,the anxiety issues I do or not nearly as severe&just want to feel normal,not lethargic and such social anxiety issues).
