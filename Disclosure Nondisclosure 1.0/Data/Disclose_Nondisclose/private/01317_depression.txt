To all those people on this site who think withdrawing from Effexor XR can be really difficult, I want to put your minds at rest by telling you it can be done with no symptoms.
 I am a 72 year old woman, and have been on antidepressants for over 20 years.  I was on 150mg Effexor XR daily for 4 years and stopped abruptly so I know what cold turkey withdrawals can be like.  They lasted two weeks, and I was good for a year after that.  Then I went on same dosage again for last 5 years.
 Earlier this year my doctor suggested I try and withdraw again and see how I go.  I want people to know that this time was so easy because I withdrew over a 10 month period.
 I have now been completely off medication for a week, and apart from a few headaches, have had no withdrawal symptoms.  I feel great.  If I can do it, I feel others can too.
 I am not saying I will carry on as I am now, and get no more withdrawal symptoms, or depression may not come back in the future, but I feel so well.  
 This is to help other people who want to withdraw from Effexor to take it really, really slowly like I have.  I went from 150mg daily to less than 5mg over those 10 months.  In the end I was cutting generic 37.5mg pills into tiny amounts.  Doing this slow withdrawal was easy.  I do hope other people may benefit from my experience.
