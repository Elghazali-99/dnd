My doc told about this website and said you ladys are nice an supportive. hmm , Im teen mom. I didnt plan to be pregnant at all because all i heard from teen moms was there boyfriends would leave them and ect. So than yeah , but i would have a boyfriend an see every once in awhile. I been with him for 2 years and 9 months. He started wanting to come over an stay the night. We used condoms. one night we didnt. so i was at hospital with my mom for me to get on birth control. but it was to late. than my mom talked to his mom. His mom was excited. and my mom was upset. and my dad was soo happy! ( never thought he would be ) i think its because my great grandpa always said "where the babys at" and kelp saying "he wants a bigger family! " now all my cousins are grown up. and when i told my boyfriend he was happy \ scared. Then a few weeks later passed i was worried he'd leave me. but he didnt. couple weeks passed he told me he planned it out. because he didnt wanna leave \ lose me. and i never knew he planned to have a baby with me.. so now all he talks about is our baby girl. im 34 weeks and he's with me through thick an thin. He has a job an everything. Well everything the baby has now he bought. (: and im glad my family loves him! <3
