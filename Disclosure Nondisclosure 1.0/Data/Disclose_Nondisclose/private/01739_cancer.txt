I have had a painless lump in my neck for several years.  It is on the left side in the same area where my lymph nodes typically swell up when I have a cold.  It is behind the upper part of my jaw, below my ear.  It is hard, painless (unless I press it rather hard), immovable and about an inch in size.  I have had two doctors who have been aware of it, but dismissed it.  The first one put me on antibiotics to make it go down, but they did not do anything.  I believe it was first noticed about 6 years ago (after a sinus infection), and I don't believe it has grown since then.  I went to a new doctor a few months ago specifically to get this checked.  He felt my neck and at first couldn't find it until I showed him...then he said he wouldn't worry about it unless it grows in size.
 I'm just wondering if I should pursue this further?  I realize there's a chance it could be lymphoma, and that scares me...but I have had no other symptoms that would indicate cancer.  I do, however, have chronic sinus congestion, and it has always been worse on the left side (mucus in nose, ear wax, and sore throats).  Could it be that my lymph node is "stuck" trying to fight off my sinus problems?  I also have mild hypothyroidism, but I don't think that's related due to the location of the lump.
