I've been talking to myself for about 4 years but it's become worse since last year during the summer. I'm always daydreaming and unable to concentrate especially on work. I began to talk out loud into myself in my apartment and in the car. People look at me as if I'm crazy and even my neighbor has moved due to me talking to myself. I have daily outbursts to the point where I experience chest pain, lightheadedness/dizziness, and headaches/migraines. My conversations always include this family member trying to control my life. Other conversations include my parents trying to boss me around. All of these conversations result in me fighting for independence in my life. 
My anxiety is really bad due to the fact that I don't want to cause problems. I've been bullied and I'm very sensitive. The good news is that I've begun to come out side the box more and become more socialable. I want to meet new ppl and make new friends. I want to explore the world but this anxiety and talking to myself is holding me back. Can this be due to stress and no friends? I just graduated from college but never really had fun during my life like others?
 I'm also always thinking about situations that I may be put in the future and what could I do to prevent or solve those problem before hand. Sad part is that I'm not sure if they will ever happen?
 Is something really wrong with me?
