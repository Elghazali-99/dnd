hai, 
      i am banupriya- a postgraduate studend 23 year old.For the last 5 years am feeling like hopeless in life and continously thinking about suicide.I am not able to concentrate in studies.Somehow i managed to complete my ug with very less marks.I am indifferent to everything now n always feeling sluggishness.My present condition is that AM  PARALYSED WITH THOUGHTS  AND SIT IDEALLY WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING FOR HOURS(planning or weaving beautiful dreams about future or very near future).This condition prevails from the last 5 years.Due to strong commitments and obligations i cant end my life,but there is no point in me living like this.I am afraid going for counselling and when i asked my parents for taking me to counselling they are saying otherts will say i am mad if they do so and it will affect my future.Only at evening around 4 pm to 6pm am  somewhat active and energetic...I don find any point in living like this with no presence of mind.I donno wats happening around and like to sit ideally wherever am sitting.Wat can i do? PLEASE HELP
                                                   .Even i feel like going for counselling alone but the problem is like, just as my parents say, if it is all about my attitude or not.Its a point of confusion.My parents were able to convince me its just an attitude problem,but i donno how just an attitude problem make me sit for hours without doing anything in this age.I am in dilemma regarding what to do... n i am studying a course in which quick grasping,judgement and all are needed.
