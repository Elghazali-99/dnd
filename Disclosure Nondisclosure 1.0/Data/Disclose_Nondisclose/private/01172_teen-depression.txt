well i thought i wouldnt do it again, i mean selfharm but i did and people always say to me i should get over it that its just a phase but i know it isnt, and i get so mad at this girl she calls her self my friend but she is never there i mean i told her to stop crying becuase she is lucky, she is always saying she has not one person but she does all her friends lend her there shoulder to cry on and they listen and her parents are always open with everything she says and she called me a ***** cause i said that shes lucky and i hate it, it isnt fair people tell me to be happy and make friends then ill get over it but i cant becuase no one wants to be friends with an emo loser so it makes it hard and well i dont have siblings i mean i do but i dont exsist to them and my dad well he isnt around and my mum says im just a detestible mistake she wishes she never had,i dont know how to deal anymore but thats not the point, i just thought id say that first so you know that what im asking is difficult ok 
im 15 and very soon im turing sixteen and for a teenager its ur most special birthday its there sweet sixteen right well im worried that ill end up crying in my room like every other birthday and i dont want that so pplease if any of you has some good ideas that i could do for my birthday that would be awesome
