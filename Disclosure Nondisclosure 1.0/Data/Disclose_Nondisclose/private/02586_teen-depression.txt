Hello everyone. I have posted many questions already, but nothing quite like this one. Well anyway, it was confirmed i have depression and anxiety, and my suicidal thoughts seem to be coming alot more frequently. Im scared. I have told my counsellor this but we didnt get much of a chance to talk about it because we were discussing other things. Well anyway, i did something scary just a few minutes ago and thought i should see what others think. I had those suicidal thoughts and suddeny grabbed a long ribbon and started winding it around my neck. And i wasnt aiming to kill myself, if that is even possible,(i dont why i did it actually) but i for some reason started to pull tighter and tighter each time. It got to a point where i thought if i pull anymore i will probably pass out or something. So i started struggling to get it off because it was sort of looped around my neck. I got out of it, and got a terrible fright. I was just wondering if this means anything? I mean is it that bad?? Should i be desperately asking for help, or should i just put it behind me? Im so scared?? Please i need someone to help me asap. :(
