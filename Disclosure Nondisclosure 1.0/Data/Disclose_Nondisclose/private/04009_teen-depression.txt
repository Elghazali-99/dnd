im new to this..ive thought about getting help online but ive never really gone through with it..
im a teenager. ive gone to at least 4 different doctors for crying myself to sleep followed by no sleep at all...or depression. i was feeling fine for a while. then someone very close to me commited suicide. all of my unanswered questions quickly arouse. i used to or still had depression..she suffered from depression. why would she do this? she left behind 2 children. and a husband who all loved her dearly. thats when my depression arouse again. i started feeling really down..gaining a lot of weight. crying myself to sleep every..single..night. and it still happens. i have one good friend. but lately ive just felt alone. ive noticed that ive kept to myself a lot lately too..my family was watching tv but id be outside by myself..just thinking about how pitiful my life is. the doctors dont seem to help. i dont know what to do. ive never had suicidal thoughts. i cant imagine..
but i dont know where to turn.
