My question is this...my father was an abusive alcoholic who kidnapped me when I was 2 months old (my mother had sole custody). He wanted his drink so bad that he would bet his drinking "buddies" that he could do whatever he wanted to me and I wouldn't cry...then tell me "if you cry I'll kill you". He would cut me, burn me with matches or his cigarettes, or just plain beat me in the head until I lost consciousness. All of this took place until I was 6 years old, at which time my mother finally found me. I had been told she was dead.  Needless to say...that so called man neglected me, abused me, and denied me of my right to a maternal bonding, which by the time I was 6 and a total stranger to each other, we never did established one. Although he is dead (2001) I still, to this day, HATE that man.  So, to my question...does the pain ever go away? By the way, I'm 49 years old with multiple health problems, according to the drs., that are directly associated with the abuse, including seizures, bi-polar, and major depression, among others. Thanks in advance for the time...
