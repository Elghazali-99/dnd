I've been with an abusive man for 16 years now and married to him for 11.
It began with physical and verbal .  Over the years he had mastered how to abuse me in every way possible.  Then the courts stepped in and the judge would no longer allow the physical and verbal abuse that took place.  He spent a little time in jail, but finally when faced with possible prison, he underwent anger management, probation, quit drinking and smoking dope.  It was like being with a new man, the one I fell in love with when we had met so long ago.  The probation ended and so did the wonderful man shortly after that.  
He never became physically violent again, but many of the other abuses are still happening.  We have a son who is 15 and loves his father, but watches him like a hawk around me after witnessing things a child should never be exposed to.  I too have changed over the years and I now know that no woman should be abused in any way for any reason.  I finally realize that I have to divorce this man in order to begin to heal.  The long-term affects of all this has left me physically disabled, mentally scarred and financially incapable to take care of myself and our son.  I live in ohio.  How do I divorce him and still be eligible to receive help financially for our son and me?  I need information on everything from walking out the door, setting up new living arrangements, counseling and filing for the divorce.  I'm not sure I know how to funcion without him, but I can't remain in such constant stress from abuse that keeps me from functioning with him.  If anyone has part or all of these answers please reply back.  Thank you for your help.
