I'm 16 years old and I think I may have depression. I recently posted this similar post on another community but thought this community may have more experience in the matter. Point is...I'm not quite sure if I'm deppressed or not. I'm pretty sure online tests aren't very accurate and it's just so frustrating to try and figure out!  I have a good family life. I do! Both my parents love me and I have two sisters that are like my best friends so why am I like this?! Even though I have anxiety issues I do have some really good friends in high school too but yet here I am. I just don't get it. I've never had high self-esteem I admit, it's gotten progressively worse from as early as seven years old to now and it's turned from a harmless little insecurity issue to self hatred, self harm and even suicidal thoughts. It's almost selfish to be like this though...I have a stable life yet I want nothing to do with it. I'm convinced I was a defect that somehow got through the filter of brilliant souls that ended up here in this world. I am a huge failure. I am barely passing one class and failing another as for all the others I'm just trying to keep a B or C average. I can't even pass junior year let alone the college years headed my way! I just...can't do it. I have tried to cut to keep all the pain away and buried inside, I don't deserve anything better. I can't tell my parents because they wouldn't understand why their daughter who is always so 'happy' is doing this to herself. No one would understand. So...I guess in the end of this kind of meaningless rant the question is am I just being a complete idiot who is just being a baby or could this be something a little more?
