Hi 
I am an adult only child in my mid 30s. I grew up in a close family. 1 yr ago my father was taking into residential care with dementia. Today I am at my mother's bedside 4days into her terminal coma that resulted from a massive stroke on Friday. 
Although I have a network of friends, they are settling down and I have periods of loneliness - but these were always limited by my relationship with my mother. She is/was my best friend as well as my mum, we spoke briefly on the phone every day, visited her for every other weekend and recently went on holiday with her. 
On top of that I have episodes of depression which always revolve around 'of life is pointless why do anything' - and the futility of actions. 
Clearly, I am heading soon into a terrible period of bereavement (which I fear my current consuming sadness is only a 'phony war'). I have been anticipating and expecting my parents' death since I was an infant (they were in their early 40s) but I had always expected it would happen in later life and that 1 would be able to lean on one to share the shock of the passing of the other. Now I have to witness the death of the most wonderful person in my world, arrange all the rituals that are coming and explain to a father who can't recognise me that his wife who he forgotten has died. 
I know that bereavement is a natural necessary process and the 5 key elements. But I think this whole scenario will tip me into long term depression, despair and rekindle my nihilist tendencies. I also know that my mum would want me to be going out and enjoying the years I have left rather than spending the rest of my life mourning her.
 Any tips for coping strategies would be enormously welcome
