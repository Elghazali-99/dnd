I just really need to know if I was and still am emotionally abused by my mother. I am a 27 year old female. I have a 2 year old special needs son. I have been living on my own well with my son actually since the age of 25 and ironically the insanity with her is even worse now I am guessing because she no longer feels in total control of me and my life. I would just like other to share their experiences. Deep down I know she is very abusive, narcissistic and plenty of other issues. I have avoided therapy all of these years because I am afraid they will just tell me to cut all ties with her. I have so much stress in my life between financial stress, the stress of my sons health and  the stress of her always being a thorn in my life. I honestly believe she is also the main reason me and my kid's father did not work out. I seem to have some issues myself with very low self esteem, bad panic attacks and what seems to be social anxiety and just want to be emotionally healthy for my own child being he needs so much more than most children.
