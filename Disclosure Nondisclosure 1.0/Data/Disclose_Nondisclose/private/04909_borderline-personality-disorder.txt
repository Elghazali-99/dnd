Dear Friends,
I am for a month on a combo of Abilify=aripiprazol + Remeron=mirtazapine + Ritalin=methylphenidate..............
That is after years my best combo ever for my Borderline with suizidal thoughts all the time.Thank god the obsession with suizide "evaporated" after a week of starting this combo.DOES ANYONE KNOWS A ALTERNATIVE TO REMERON,leaving this combo intact ???REMERON made me gain weight 20 lbs within a month,although I did not change my diet a bit...And because I need to advance with my classical guitar (professional) I need honestly kill two birds with one stone.To come trough the gruesome,demanding and draining schedule of practizing I need anyway a stimulant.PHENTERMINE would do the trick !?!?Ritalin helps with my ADHD and depression,YES.But it makes me almost sedated,because of the pleasant disappereance of ever changing thoughts(Beehive)That extra energy and weightloss would be welcome.I hope to get the thumps up.My guitar is my important and only source of pleasure and near future need to perform.Thanks in advance   toens
