i get screamed at constantly it scares me and my little dog i had trouble picking which kind of abuse i am getting as i fit into all of the catagories. He used to be more in the sexual category then it became more emotional then financial until now my turkey got thrown out the door. He always ruins special events every one I am sick with lupus and hep and constant migraine chronic pain i am starting to believe that abuse of any kind will make you sick i do stick up for myself lately then he records me on his phone   he has denied me medical attention and now is so mean i just dont think i can stay  i need to find a way out of here  how do we get into these kinds of traps and why is it so hard for women to get support to get away from these guys.If I was still able to work at my siding installer job i could easily walk away and find a new home for me and my dog  he is like my child as i could not have any  i pray every night either for him to change or for me to find a way out  i cant stop crying i have been so sick and in hospital just other day and still the yelling keeps going   i am open to sugguestions where does a very sick person go ?welfare gives us 749 mnth who can live on that i am hanging on by a thread please any advice
