Hi , I'm 55, last period was over 6 years ago. For the last 8 weeks I've been experiencing slight spotting , not often at first but lately almost every couple of days. I went to my GP who immediately fast tracked me for an emergency gynaecological consultation. I subsequently had a transvaginal ultrasound and outpatient uterine biopsy , still awaiting the results of the biopsy . Consultant has said if the biopsy comes back clear he will recommend Vagifem pessaries be prescribed by my GP. 
On reading about Vagifem, I'm confused. I cannot find any information that says it is used to treat post menopausal spotting/bleeding, in fact quite the opposite , I've read it can cause spotting/ bleeding as a side effect. I have no other symptoms ie dryness, itching etc etc , which it appears is why Vagifem is usually prescribed. 
I'm also concerned when reading the contra indications for prescribing Vagifem, as I have benign breast disease, and a family history on maternal side of breast cancer. 
Anyone else been prescribed Vagifem for post menopausal spotting?
