Okay I know some of you are probably about to roll your eyes at me. I understand that and I'd probably be the same way if I heard this. But please hear me out?
 Anyways I like this guy for the longest time ever! Three years to be exact. I never told him I liked him, my mistake. So he found a new girl and they dated for two years. They are seriously the cutest couple ever! And she is so nice to talk to. Anyways I found out last night there getting engaged. Part of me is sooo happy for him, I wouldn't want any other female with him except her. But the other half feels like I'm broken because I just wish it was me, you know? I haven't cried or anything...I just feel pretty depressed. I haven't eaten anything, and all I think about is him. I feel like a terrible person for feeling the need to not want this to happen, how do I stop that? It's wrong! And how do I get out of this heartbreak? I mean we never even dated and he has no clue how I feel about him. The last day of the month I plan on going to the movies with them...I'm afraid I'll breakdown and cry or something. Please help! And is this normal to feel this way, because I feel awful?! Thanks.
