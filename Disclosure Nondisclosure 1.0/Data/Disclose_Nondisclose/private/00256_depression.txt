I'm going to be a sophomore in college this coming fall. And last semester I got such bad grades not even above a 2.0. I'm not that kind of person to give up so easily and I usually have above a 3.0 average. Anyways what led to me flunking last semester I was diagnosed with OCD.  It was bad and I couldn't handle it anymore, and finally decided to go back to therapy. I'm doing much better. But I'm afraid to go back to college... Since I did bad, I HATE my major so much I can't stand it. I don't know what to even major in anymore, and I'm defiantly not going into just liberal arts. There is one thing that I do enjoy doing, but I'm afraid of it incase my family says no, and that is Journalism. I would totally love to do that, but I don't know if I will succeed. I want to be good at my major and in all honesty I feel like I'm not good at anything. ALL my friends know what they want to do and they talk about it on Facebook and how all of them are completing their internships. It's making me really depressed, I just don't believe in myself... and I don't know how to be confident. Please words of wisdom or advice will be greatly appreciated.
