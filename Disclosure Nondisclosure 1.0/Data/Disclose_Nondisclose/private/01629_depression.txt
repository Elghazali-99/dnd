Hiall,
 what is it you guys did to overcome depression which is accompanied by extreme bouts of anger(going through a bad divorce(11yrs of dirt),feel used);
I have definitely come a long way;one month back i was all crying and begging;today have moved much ahead,no contact,accepted the divorce;but sometimes in between I get really wild suddenly and shout and abuse;whenever I remember that i  was no aware of him cooking divorce and staying with me at the same time and all the misbehaviour towards me and blaming me in the end and treating me like **** and making me feel like he was so good for me;;;;;;;;causes me uncontrollable rage;;;i feel like strangling him;;;i feel so sad;;;
 to add to this,my anger comes out on family who love me;i happens for example whnevre i find them in temper(any of my family),i get terribly angry for unknown reasons ad then it becomes hell; in last 2 months there has been 4 times of this rage;;;;;
 today i was crying bitterlly in front of my mom;i felt so overwhelmed and did not know why i was crying;;;;;;
I tend to forgive that person thinking I have a bad temper(extreme guilt because of my  temper always covers me);bu actually I feel the ordeal like a kind of deciet and i feel so sad.
 Any of you gone through a similar circumstance or any advice for me???
