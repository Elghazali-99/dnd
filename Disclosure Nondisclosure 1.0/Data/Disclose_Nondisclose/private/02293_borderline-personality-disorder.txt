I have just recently been assessed for bpd, my therapist never told me he just got me to fill out a questionaire, when i looked it up on the internet thats what it was for, he never told me the results either but he keeps saying things like, i have difficulty regulating emotions and i don't know what emotions i am experiencing and when he asked me who i was i said i didn't know i said i am whoever the people i am with want me to be, he said that is such a classic statement, i will admit i do have mental health issues, i suffer from argraphobia, depression, ocd, panic attacks and PTSD, i will admit i do have alot of the symptoms of bpd but i always thought they had to be extreme i don't see myself as extreme. I am confused about alot of things and my mood changes constantly one hour i am fine and the next i am suicidal it changes so quick, most of the time i don't know how i feel. I go get angry alot and it takes very little to set me of and then that causes me to be suicidal. I adore my therapist one day and then if he upsets me i withdraw from him, in saying that it also takes very little to upset me.
What i'm asking is does this sound like bpd and if it is why won't he tell me? and why now i'm 34yrs old surely they would have picked this up before now, i have been in therapy for 16 years with 5 different therapists.
I am very confused about all this.
