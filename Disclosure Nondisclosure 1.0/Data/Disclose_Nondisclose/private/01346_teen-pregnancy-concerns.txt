Hello my name is Alejandra and I'm 19 years old. I had my period twice (Both lasted like 4-5 days each) on May and had no period at all on June. Since my periods on May I still haven't gotten my period again. I have an app on my phone which predicts my periods and it predicted my period to start about 5 days ago so I got a bit worried.....but then I remembered that on May at the end of my package of pills I failed to get the new package on time and had to start a new one and wait a week before having sex. I heard this might mess up my cycle and that I might miss it for a month and then it gets back on track. So with that in mind I predict my period to start sometime next week when I start taking the brown pills. But I'm not sure if we actually waited a full week before having sex, and he never wears a condom since I'm on the Pill. So my question is, could I be pregnant..... or am I right and my body is just getting adjusted to the new set of pills? How much do I have to wait after I miss my period to take a test?
