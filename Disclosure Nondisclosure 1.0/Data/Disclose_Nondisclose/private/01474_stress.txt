I have been stressing a lot over the last year or so because I have too much to deal with and not enough support. Please let me vent, and if you have some advice, please please let me know.
1. I am 39, female, single, 1 teenage daughter, living with 81-year-old dad for the past 7 years after my mom (who was my #1 support person) died. Moved in to save money, help dad...now just have to get out and live our own lives, feeling like a little girl with rules.
2. I am currently looking for a nice place for said daughter and I in the area. Looking meaning online and in the paper, only have seen 1 place so far.
3. I have extremely low energy, am severely overweight, and have a mood disorder with depression. This makes me feel like showering is the greatest hurdle to overcome in a day, so that doesn't even get done sometimes. Trying to raise my daughter amidst all of this, and she is experiencing some of the same stuff I do.
 I am blessed to have my life, my family, everything. As I said, I am mainly looking for an outlet to dump the occasional overflow that gathers in my head once in a while. It seems that I have so much to do, I would rather do nothing at all. It is sometimes good to have an outsider's perspective on things, and I hope that some of you might have some tips or soothing words or kick my butt somehow...
 Thanks for listening...hope to hear from you.
