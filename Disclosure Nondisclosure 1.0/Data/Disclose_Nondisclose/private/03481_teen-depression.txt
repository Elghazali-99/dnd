i feel really odd and silly typing this up because i'm usually the person lashing out at all the teenagers claiming they're "depressed" when they're really just going through what every other teenager goes through. but i'm 16 and i've always been somewhat of an introvert, not very social, awkward, etc but the past year months or so i really feel like i'm losing myself.  i've been feeling a lot of unreasonable anger toward my sick grandmother, whom i share a room with. i can't stand her even talking to me. i haven't slept in my room in over a year because she smells terrible and wont ever shut up and sometimes i feel as if i should feel guilty for treating her the way i do, but i don't at all. everyday, i hope she dies or just disappears from my life. and this anger stays with me all day long and its too the point where it just makes me angry at everything and everyone. i can't stand being around my parents or my friends, i hate getting of the couch (my bed), i hate moving (walking, getting up to use the bathroom), and i want nothing more than to sit on the couch all day long and stare at the wall. with college stuff coming around, i just feel really lost. i dont know what to strive for. i dont have goals or passions. i cant think of a single thing i'm good at or enjoy doing. and i dont want to end my life, i never have. but i dont exactly want to LIVE either. what is going on with me? i don't want to keep hurting my family and friends.
