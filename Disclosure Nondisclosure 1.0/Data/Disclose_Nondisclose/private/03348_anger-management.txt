Hi everyone.  I would like to start by introducing myself and explaining my situation first.  I ama young, unmarried female with a two year old son.  I have been in a 7 year relationship with his dad but it has been on and off.  We were last broken up for about a year and a lot has happened in that time.  He has tried to ask me back, but I was too angry to consider it.  Two months ago, I realized I miss him and that perhaps I didn't try hard enough to make our relationship work.  Well, needless to say, we are tryingto work things out but are ont officially back together.
I used to abuse him both verbally and physically.  When we reunited, I obviously thought I had changed, but I was mistaken.  the truth is, he is at a point in his life where he needs alot of support and encouragement, which I try to offer to him, but when I am angry, all I do is break him down and say mean things to him and hit him.
I am a loving, good, driven woman who comes from a very good familyand that's the hard part.  He know's I am a good woman but he is always reminded of my temper tantrums and it prevents us from moving forward.  I would really like to join a support group but cant seem to find any in South Africa.  Please help, I can't even stand to look at myself in the mirror knowing what I'm doing to him.
