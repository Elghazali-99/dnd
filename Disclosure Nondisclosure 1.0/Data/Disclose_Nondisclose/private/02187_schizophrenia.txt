My friend has really been worrying me lately. I don't know a lot about schizophrenia but what i do know, this sounds kinda like that. I was just wondering what you guys thought. 
 First of all I should say she has bipolar, borderline personality disorder and depression. So it could be something to do with that but I'm not sure.
 First of all, I know she hears things and I think sometimes hears things that aren't really there. This really scares her. Recently he has told me that she thinks shes knows things that nobody else does. I asked her what she meant by this and she told me she couldn't tell me because if she did "they" might know. I asked who "they were" and she said she couldn't tell me again. I asked if she couldn't because she didn't know and she said she had a good idea who they were. I narrowed it down a bit by asking questions and it's a power that's bigger than the government however it is not God. But she wouldn't tell me anymore. She says if she tells anyone "they" will either find out and do something bad OR the badness will be put onto me. I know she's not in any kind of trouble, this is definitely a psychological thing. She's also told me before that if she tells me things, she feels like inanimate obects like her phone will hear what she says and tell other things who will turn on her. 
I can't explain how deeply she believes this. It's to the point that it scares me and she said she can't talk to her therapist because "she's in on it too". What do I do? Does this sound like paranoid schizophrenia or something else? Any ideas? Thank you so much to whoever reads this!!!
