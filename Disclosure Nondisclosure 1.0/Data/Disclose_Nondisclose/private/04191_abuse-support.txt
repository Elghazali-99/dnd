Hello, I am a mom who has finally had the courage to confront her own mother on the abuse I endured as a child. She was very verbally abusive and often would throw things at me, hit or punch me if she got riled up enough. This year she asked to come stay with me (we live in another state) for the holidays. I was hesitant about having her which upset her very much and she couldn't understand why I wouldn't welcome her with open arms. I tried to beat around the bush, but finally had to admit to her it was because I was scared to have her in my house for that long. She continued to scream and hit me well into my late twenties so I know that she has not "mellowed" with age. I told her that I forgive her and want to work through this and still love her very much. But she is saying I am immature for not letting this go. And I now have a baby to consider. I love her very much and when she is not upset she is absolutely amazing. But since I admitted to her that I have some healing to do from her hitting and abusing me over the years she has refused to talk to me. She is totally shutting me out and I worry about her nonstop. She has a tendency to drink too much and may be bipolar. So now I am obsessed with worrying about her and if she is even still alive and kicking some days. She lives alone and doesn't have anyone close by. She won't answer my calls, texts or emails.  This is affecting my marriage and I feel like a zombie most days. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.....
