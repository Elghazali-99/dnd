Hi everyone, I am posting this for someone I know as she won't seek help (even though I regularly ask her too). 
 Ok so here are her 'symptoms':
 She has high or low mood swings, with no warning almost daily. She has  very low self esteem but it seems like that fluncuates very rarely from very low to just being 'okay with herself'. She avoids all social environments, and if she's in one she won't look anyone in the eyes. She pretty much stays in her house most of the time. She gets very panicky when she does drive and someone gets behind her. She's distanced herself from almost everyone she knows , except her 3 year old daughter. Her family and friends will call and most times she won't answer because 'she doesn't feel like picking up the phone and talking to people' and this will happen 3/4 times. She has a hard time sleeping.  
 Also, I wanted to know if she can get disability if she has a personality disorder, I know she'll have to seek professional help (I'm trying to get her to now). She went to a  trade school 4years ago, but her symptoms have gotten allot worse since then.  She worked while in college but a few months after graduation the symptoms elevated and she had to quit work.
 ANY HELP/ ADVICE IS APPRECIATED! thank you kindly!
