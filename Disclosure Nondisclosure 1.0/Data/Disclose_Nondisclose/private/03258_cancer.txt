Hi fellow doctors,
 I am in need of SERIOUS help here, as we know Pneumonia kills millions of people a year alone. My mother at the moment is 6 months through chemotherapy after having Bowel cancer and Liver cancer at stage 4, being operated on two MAJOR organs of the body at the same time in a 13 hour operation; to be able to recuperate and recover from that was a miracle itself. She is fighting fit and healthy 6 months later, HOWEVER... My step dad has just been admitted to the Emergency Department after getting every system for Pneumonia, at first we thought it was Shingles... My mother was very cautious and always wore a face mask and isolated my step father in their room, she always washed her hands with bacterial handwash and takes precautions, such as using my bathroom and sleeping in the spare room, complete isolation.
 I am very feared, now my step father is in the hospital now freaking out that he has given my mother Pneumonia, if she gets this disease It'll be the death of her at 47 years of age. He has had this illness for 4 days so far and mum has shown no signs so far as to receiving the disease due to precautionary actions. My question is how long do symtoms take to show? We are going tomorrow to the Oncology unit as she is prioritised for number 1 at the moment BUT tonight is a restless night and I seek every answer known to mankind to make sure my mother is in fit fighting health, what signs would she show and at what stage?
 I hope anyone can help in any way, shape and/or form. 
 Thank you MedHelp,
Regards, Tom.
