Anyone taking this drug should realize that if it is not working or is causing undesired side effects that are unbearable to handle, be wary about stopping suddenly or a careless weaning off this drug.
  I felt that my doctor did not forewarn me of the withdrawal effects once I stopped taking this medication. At the time I had no way of getting the medication (due to financial complications) to wean myself off of it slowly and I would suffer withdrawal effects like brain tremors, shakes, vertigo, vomiting, dizziness, irritability, confusion and unable to walk or stand. These would last for days and I felt like I wanted to just lie down and die, I hurt so much. 
 I honestly feel that many of these types of drugs should not be available or distributed. I have taken other anti-depressants and this drug caused more emotional and mental complications along with physical distress than any other similar type of drug. While on this medication I was more reckless, uncaring of anything around me and I ended up with a DUI when I have never drove drunk in my life nor had I committed any other crime. I couldn't maintain a job and lost my car due to lack of payments. I simply didn't care enough. I also hardly ever drank but with this drug I didn't know my limit. I wasn't myself at all, I felt I lost my identity. I knew this medication was not for me. 
 This drug I feel is comparable to Oxycontin (Oxycodone) and Morphine as far as side effects and withdrawals are concerned. I also find myself at times craving Effexor for its "numbing" effects. This has turned me off to any anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication and now I only go to therapy. I find that I function without it much better and I feel like myself again.
 How can I ever take medication again without a concern for something like this to happen again or even worse?
