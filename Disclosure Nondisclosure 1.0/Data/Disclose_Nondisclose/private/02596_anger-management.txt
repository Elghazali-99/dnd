So im quite confused with myself, just wondering what others have to say about my situation. I am a 17 year old male, who has gone through quite a few mental health issues over the past 6 months. changing schools, houses, anxiety over disease, hiv in particular, anxiety about my health, my life etc. I feel sometimes like a rock, no emotion, past or future. Now anger is starting to brew from all this as i am beggining to get furious with myself for not being able to go back to normal. I am easily set off by friends of mine, when only joking around with me, or when a girl im interested in ends up with a friend of mine. This anger is overwhelming, it zones me right out, and changes who i am. Furthermore, i like the feeling it gives me to a certain extent. I enjoy imagining giving some kind of great big (pardon the french) "**** You" to everyone whose angered me. (NOT ANYTHING SUICIDIAL OR SELF HARMING). im just wondering if that is normal or not, and what the reason for this could be?
