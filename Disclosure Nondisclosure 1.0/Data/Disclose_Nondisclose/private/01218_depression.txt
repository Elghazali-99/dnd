Hello dear medhelp friends,
 Relatively, everything is going okay for me lately. Just keeping on top of the parts of my life that i cant change quite yet. I would say that I have recovered from depression but lately something strange has been happening.
 I suppose you could say that Ive been feeling a lot of shame over the way I behaved at the peak of my depression. Sometimes at work or at home when my mind is idle I think back to when I was in hospital for suicide attempts and I just get really sad and ashamed of myself. I think of the nurses who had to deal with me. I look back and it is like a big blur. Days melted into eachother but my hospital stays really get to me. I dont recognise the person I was back then. I was so out of character. Out of it really. 
I feel so much shame that the hospital staff seen me like that. I dont like when my mind flickers back to those times and i dont understand why it happens. 
 Is this normal. Has anyone else experienced anything like this during recovery. Its something id like to leave in the past so why is my brain dredging it all back up again. Will it stop with time.
 Again, im recovered now and this isnt a big concern its just bugging and i hope someone can shed some light on this or give me some advice.
 Thank you all.
