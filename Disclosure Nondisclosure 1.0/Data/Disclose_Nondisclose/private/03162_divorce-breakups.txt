New here. 
A little background, to start.  
I was married to my second husband for ten years. The first eight were very happy and I thought we were soulmates. But then he got his dream job and the stress turned my "sweet husband" into a hostile, negative, self-absorbed work-aholic who was so focused on his career that he neglected me, our three grown daughters, and our marriage. We didn't talk about the problems or argue because, if he was grouchy, I didn't want to make it worse and on a rare good day, I didn't want to ruin it. So for two years I became more lonely and more miserable and then something happened that turned my life upside down.  I went to a funeral for the mother of my old boyfriend from 27 years before.  He and I took one look at each other and we couldn't look away. It took our breath away for both of us. And I was so lonely and so miserable and so desperate to be loved again that I fell for him all over again.  Three days later I told my ex husband that I wanted a divorce and I immediately moved in with the old boyfriend and we're still together a year later. Sounds crazy because it was. I think I suffered some kind of a nervous breakdown as this is not like me at *all.*   I have always been the stable, level-headed Suzy Home-maker, Betty Crocker, business woman, wife, mother, and now grandmother. This was the only really impulsive thing I ever did.  And now, a year later....I think it was the biggest mistake I've ever made. And I don't know how to fix it. Or even if I should try. I don't know if I just miss my old life and who I was in it, or if I truly do miss my ex husband. I've never been this torn or this confused.
