I need proffessional advice for this (im going to preface this question by saying im typing this on my ipad so excuse any typos).
I am a 16 year old girl and i have shown symptoms of major depressive disorder since i was 4 years old. I know this is a pretty far out idea but bear with me.
I began taking medication for depression and anxiety when i was nine, so ive been taking medication for 7 years. Ive read about how people who develop somewhat of a situtional depression sometimes only have to take medication for 6 months. When i think about this i cant help but feel a deep feeling of jealousy and resentment for my needing to take medication for so long. I accept that i am a damaged person and most likely always will be, but recently ive felt extremely stable.
I feel i should provide some detail into my last depressive episode in case the interval of time of stability is of importance. Last summer, i had a depressive episode that lasted for some-odd months, and i ended up in a psych unit for 2 weeks before being transfered to an intense month long inpatient unit. This unit is one of the best in the country and i can honestly say i dont know where id be had i not been admitted there. Since i got out, ive had semi-mild depressive episodes, but nothing too intense. Recently ive had a med shedule consisting of prozac, lamotrigine, seroquel, and methylphenadate er for my really bad adhd along with intunive to counteract the jitteryness side effect. I want so badlytonot have to take medicationfor my depression anymore, so i was wondering is there any way to predict when i may be able to go med free?
I appreciate it very much if you took the time to read this, because i know its long. And if you have an answer, i would very much appreciate if you share.
