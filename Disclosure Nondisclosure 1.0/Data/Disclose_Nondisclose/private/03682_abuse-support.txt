In the past week, my 13 year old son was arrested for sexual assualt and molestation of a child, my 5 year old stepdaughter. He admitted to doing it. Not just curious but he according to testimony raped her. My husband is her father and we have a child in common that is 1.5 years old. I am very worried and torn. My son and I were all we had as his father had stepped out of his life for a long time and had slowly reentered. My son has undiagnosed Asperger's, previous symptoms of ADHD. My husband wants him fully proecuted and I understand, but this is also my son. We've been told he may not face any jail time due to his mental state and his age as well of his previous victim status. My hubby and his ex wants maximum sentence and we know we both need counseling on this issue. I have to pick between one child or the other. I don't know if he will be able to accept the fact that his mommy has had to choose the other family so he can get help. I don't think he did anything to his younger brother as he loves him but I question it as does others. Everyone I talk to tells me they would not trade me places for nothing but that they agree he is still my son and he needs help. I can't even stop thinking about him to think even once about my stepdaughter and this puts my husband in a place that he thinks I don't care, especially since I'm a social worker. I've worked with children and adults of domestic violence and abuse. I've been trainied to show that you can show no emotions while someone is telling you their story, and I feel that this is what is kicking in, as I've already gone thourhg my hysterical state the first 2 days that this was brought to our attention. I'm looking for some help from somewhere whether local or not, a support group for mothers of teenage sexual deviant children and how they cope with this.
