Hi,
 I'm a 42 yr.old woman... I was dating this guy I really loved for 1 1/2 years despite us having problems. Over a year ago he bacame cold and distant towards me...wouldn't give me much attention..lack of sex and wasn't suiting my needs.
 On day we had a major fight over those issues and I told him to leave...to get out. He up and left and I tried to contact him so we could talk but he never returned my calls/texts. 
 Three weeks later I ran into on old friend of mine from 15 years ago...we used to party together but nothing happened between us. We started dating and he was the most WONDERFUL...CARING..SWEET man to me....handsome..smart... my friends and family loved him.
 He would bring me flowers..leave me sweet love notes take me out and show me off and wine and dine me.made me feel so special and appreciated. I had deep feelings for him and loved him but I was still in love with my ex.
 I had surgery done an he waited on me hand and foot...he held my hand in the recovery room and was amazing to me...so very helpful and sweet. Eleven days after the surgery my ex. texts me and said love you..miss you...I was torn on what to do....3 days later I broke up with the sweet wonderful (he was my boyfriend) man to go back to my ex. This is my second time back to him.
 I hurt him so terribly bad....he did so much for me.....should I call him and apoligize and to see how he's doing? Do you think he still cares for me?
