Hello! My name is Devon and I've been diagnosed with Bi polar 2, panic and anxiety disorder and ocd. I've been doing great lately until abouta week ago when I woke up one morning ( still feeling fine  ) and had 4 cups of coffee throughout the morning. I ate and then decided to do a work out... During the workout I was feeling really weak so I stopped half way through and called it a day for that. I took a bath and my feelings of my body being weak just got worse. I started getting really restless and brain foggy. I literally walked around the house to abour 5 hours straight. At the time I didn't really have much anxiety or anything like that. The next 2 days I was feeling similar to that day and all of a sudden I started getting super bad anxiety and upper stomach gross feeling. My brain was really foggy and my body just felt like it was rejecting something. I was really weak and my body was shaky. I ended up freaking out and having to go to the hospital where I was in the pysch department for 6 hours. My blood work came back fine and of course no drugs in my system or whatever. They sent me home with some adivan ? I think its called... And when I take that it makes me feel calm but about 8 days on from my over consumption of coffee and stuff like that I still am getting brain fog, anxiety and my body feels like its rejecting and twitchy/jittery. ( even though I'm extremely tired ) I don't know if this is an induced bi polar episode or something like that but its really bugging me and I feel like I'm going crazy. The pills I take are Gabapentin 100mg, Risperidone .25 I think and venflaxine. O.35. Before all of this I was doing better than I ever have so its weird I'm going into this spell. Any help is good
