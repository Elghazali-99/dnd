I'm 17. I got on the depo in right around the beginning of September because my boyfriend and I got together September 2nd and that's the rule in the house if you date get on birth control. The first time we had sex was September 29, the second time October 23 and the third November 5 (and yes my family advised I wrote down when just in case if this ever happened.) My period started Sep 10 and if I remember correctly is was kind of short. Since I've been on birth control I VERY lightly spotted for 2 weeks and then nothing. I haven't spotted since that last time and lately I've been peeing sooo much. 4 times in the night and during the day seems like every 2 hours, my family said my mood has changed a lot and I've felt so freaking tired but then again we stay up pretty late, I do online school and work. I don't want to jinks and this could just be my depo but I've heard people getting pregnant on it. We have used a condom every time....I just need advice....what yeah.........................please
