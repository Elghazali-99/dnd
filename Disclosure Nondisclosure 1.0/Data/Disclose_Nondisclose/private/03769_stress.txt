Scenario: 1st off I have panic disorder, so the thought always make things worse. Ok, so 2 weeks ago, I had to all of a sudden put my cat down which broke my heart, that following weekend was my dads 70th surpise party, I pigged out on pepperoni and Extra Sharp Provolone, there was alot extra, so I took it home and ate it all week. That Friday night, I felt a POP POP POP in my left breast area, thought it might be gas, but was hard to breath a bit. Called doc and he thinks it's a pulled muscle, I didnt do anything strenuous, I dont think.
Ok, so this is the 5th day and The left side feels much better and I can breath better.
But for the past 2 days I have had a kind of throbbing annoying pain right on the top of my right breast, it comes and goes, last night it totally went away only to be back thgis morning? PLEASE, I am petrified of tests, docs and all that stuff and am working myself up to a panic attack, the only thing that is helping me right now is .05 of ativan. Any Ideas on what this could be?
