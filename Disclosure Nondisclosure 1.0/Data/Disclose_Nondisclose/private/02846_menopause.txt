I'm 45 and am going through menopause. I haven't menstruated in over 4 months (yay!). The only symptom I have is the hot flashes. I know I'm lucky that it's the only symptom, but it is really bad. I wake up regularly at night with damp hair and wet pillow, feeling like I'm smothering. I sleep with a fan blowing on me, but it doesn't seem to help. My hubby complains because my skin gets very hot (like I have a high fever) and he is a "sleeping snuggler". As soon as he goes to sleep, he throws his arm and at least one leg across me. Then he complains because he sweats from the heat coming off me. LOL  
I have the hot flashes during the day too, but it's much worse at night. Are there any tips or tricks to help with this?
Also, is it normal to be drastically "uneven" with temperature? I've noticed that many times, my arms/hands are cold at the same time that my legs are hot and sweating. Sometimes it's vice-versa. It makes it much harder to get comfortable. I am fairly thin, and have always been cold-natured. Not anymore!
Thank you for any advice you can share with me!
