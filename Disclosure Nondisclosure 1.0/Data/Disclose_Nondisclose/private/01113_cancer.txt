I'm a 30 year old woman and have been dealing with fatigue for quite a while. I also have Dizziness when standing, occasional night sweats and a small slightly swollen lymph node behind my ear. Finally saw my Dr. at the beginning of the year at which time she noted that my WBC had been slowly decreasing, slight neutropenia. My Dr. also had a CT done of my neck and said it was unremarkable.
 After keeping an eye on my numbers for a few months she decided I needed to see a hematologist. I finally ended up having a Bone marrow biopsy/aspirate after another waiting period of a few months. My hematologist seems stumped and insists on seeing me in 6 months and that my report was "fine" other than a missing CD16 Expression.
 However upon further reading I found a few notes that caught my eye.
 -Slight neutropenia 1.2K/microliter
-increased lymphocytes
-Mature B-Cells CD5 and CD10 co-expressing cells(minimal)
-Mature B-Cells CD103 and CD20 co-expressing cells(rare to absent)
-Missing CD16 expression
-CD45 Negative Events
-Normochromic erythrocytes with minimal degree of anisopoikilocytosis
-"It is not possible to entirely exclude a slight increase in interstitial lymphoid cells although they are not specifically suspected(by Hematologist)
-"Natural Killer Cells and T-LGLs present, but not increased or atypical"
-Suggests peripheral blood sent in for "PNH" testing.
*No increase in blasts
*CD20 positive B Cells-9.2%
*CD3 positive T Cells-83%
*Natural killer sells-5%(lymphocytes)
 It has been 9 months since I decided to see my doctor, I am still very confused and don't want anything to go under the radar. Does anyone know if this should be cause for concern?
