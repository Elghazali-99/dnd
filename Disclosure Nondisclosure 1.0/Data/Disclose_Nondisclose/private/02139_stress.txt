Hello all, 
 I am a 25 year old healthy male. I had a very traumatic  experience about two years ago with a scare with hepatits C it caused a lot of stress in my life. Thankfully I was very blessed and one of the lucky ones to fight off the virus and and okay. That obviously took a huge toll on me. Long story short I started developing these pains in my hands and feet and now can be all over at times. It's like an ache. I have been doig a lot of reading and was wondering if anyone has any insight on what could be causing these pains? I get nervous looking on the Internet and seeing things like HIV causing these pains. I am not very sexually active only one unprotected partner in the past two years of unknown status. Could the stress have caused these pains as I have read that can happen. I have been an athlete all my life thought maybe my body was breakingn down a bit or something but I doubt that at my age. I would appreciate any help on this subject if anyone is going through the same thing. Idk if I should go to a doctor or maybe this is a common thing.
 Thank you for your time and help!
