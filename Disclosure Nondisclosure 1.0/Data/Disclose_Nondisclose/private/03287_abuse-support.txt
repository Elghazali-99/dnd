Hello.I am male 28 no girlfriends.everyone likes me i am very funny n good looking 6'2 height.people admire me as I don't tease girls and women.I was touched and got introduced to masturbated when I was eleven.I dont even know what that was I just use to feel good because of that.I use to do that .one idiot showed me porn when I was 15 or 14 at the same time I saw real boobs.my tuition teacher use to feed her son before me.in that curiosity I came home and touched my elder sister boobs while she was sleeping one night she touched my pennis as she was only 3 years older then me.I use to peep into my sis room and masturbated.I was eighteen by that time.I stopped all that and use to masturbated watching porn.now I stopped watch in that also and my past memories are killing me in all ways.people think iam a good person but I feel like killing myself .I still think if that person's didn't teach me masturbation and porn I would have been a different person.I am afraid of girls now I can never love any girl genuinely I feell like water of leaving and I am a biggest sinner on this planet.I spoke to y sister also and she told me that it's because of harmonies but non of my friends did any such things.I also feel like a loser.when ever I think about sex all this things come to my mind and I get depressed.I always feel why me....
