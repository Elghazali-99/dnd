i am the girlfriend of a man who only wants sex when HE wants it, when i want it he's not interested. 
he used to watch porn until i explained that i feel uncomfortable about it and he said he'd stopped 
we have been together for nearly a year and we used to have sex daily, sometimes twice, but now im lucky if i get anything once a week sometimes once a fortnight! 
he says that he is tired and stressed about money and work and that he doesnt feel like it (unless he wants it!) 
however last night i awoke (from noise and movement) during the night to find him masturbating and moaning as if he were acting out a porn!! i was discusted that he's telling me he's too tired and making me go without when he's 'sorting himself out' in his sleep while thinking about other women :( 
i am not a fan of porn and would not consider watching it with him, but i am worried that he is no longer interested in me or perhaps the fact that im not filthy is making him resort to these habits, i dont want to go without sex because he's already sorted himself out the night before thinking about someone else, how can i stop him thinking about other people in his sleep so that we get our sex life back on track?? IM SO UPSET!! :(
