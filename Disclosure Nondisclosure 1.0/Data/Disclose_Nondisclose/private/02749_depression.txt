I have not been on here for a long time so I hope it's still a helpful resource!  I just started taking Wellbutrin (generic) last Monday and I have had the weirdest week. Shaky, off balance, this constant high pitched noise in my ears, one day a lot of energy and feeling pretty good, then feeling so crappy for most of the other days, and I've been waking up in the morning with an odd taste in my mouth, which by the way is like a dried up river. What makes the side effects worse is that I'm a hypochondriac - major health anxiety! So of course all week I've got myself so consumed with what's happening  in my body that I think I'm making things worse. Last night I woke up probably around 3 or 4 and noticed some pain in my head...I haven't been able to fall back to sleep since then. It makes me afraid to get out of bed and start my day. I'm just laying here obsessing about this pain! I am also taking fluoxetine for anxiety, which normally does the job, but not so much this week. 
So I'm wondering how to deal with these side effects? I really want to see if the meds will help ease my depression but I just feel like I won't be able to handle feeling so shaky and weird for a real long time. Please let me know if you've had a similar experience and how you managed. Again, I'm pretty sure my health anxiety is adding to my problem here...(I will be feeling my head and worrying about this new pain all day, I'm sure)
Thanks!!
