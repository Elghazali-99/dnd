So....I've been living with struggling with and suffering from BPD for many years. Been receiving treatment for some mental illness for 18 years.... I've moved around a lot, can't seem to find the right place, so of course new move, new doctor. Each doctor seem to disagree with the last- new diagnosis, new meds. All these years being guessed upon for diagnosis's, Bern prescribed the last drug the rep just dropped off.... It was 6 years ago since I survived our was BPD. Only in the last year and a half I was finally getting the treatment I needed- until this passed summer... My youngest child turned six, I no longer qualify for medical care. My therapy ended, meds have stopped.... I feel my mind spinnng out of control. Every blog, website, self help show our book...they all say ask for help! I read posts on here from concerned friend it family members of people with BPD and wish I had someone like that, to help me. I no what's wrong with me, I know I need help.... But what do you do when none is offered our available. I am terribly terribly burdened by my mind- will someone please hear me!!!!
