There are so many medical communities that I can relate to and want to post but they seem so out dated and no one is participating...I'm taking my chances here to see if anyone responds. 
 Me and my ex were together 9 yrs, we moved in together after 6 months, dated 7 years and were married the last 2 years. About 6 yrs in, he was acting shady. Going out with friends and not coming home saying he drank too much and couldn't drive. Then a bunch of money started to go missing and I found hotel charges in the bank acct. He said it was his brother using the rooms. I guess I felt trapped since we bought a house before we were married but in retaliation one night in the woods just over 3 yrs ago I kissed another guy. 6 months later I slept with the other guy...and we kind of carried on a relationship for 3 yrs even though I was married and still kind of with my ex. Which btw his behavior never changed over all that time. To wrap this up, last year me and the other guy started to get carried away and not use anything and I'm now 9 months pregnant with his baby. I found out in oct, moved out in dec and finalized my divorce in april. My now bf moved in to my place in March and things are so different. We fight all the time, and neither of us are the same person we were when it was kind of a fling. I'm feeling a lot of regret and asking myself what if(?) All the time. I think I'm missing my ex but he wasn't any better, idk what to do. Move on from both of them?
