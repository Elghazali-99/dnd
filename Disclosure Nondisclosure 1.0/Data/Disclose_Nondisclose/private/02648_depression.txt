hello i have previously posted about these horrible thoughts i am having...it all started 4 months ago when i suffered my first panic attack......when suffering from anxiety i one time saw  story that some children killed there mom....after that i slowly started having thoughts questioning if i am capable of doing such a horrible thing...i got so scared that i didnt know what to do....i have never been an aggressive person i have always felt sympathy to people who have problems....i just want you guys to comment if it is normal...i am seeing a therapist and i tell him everything he only diagnosed me with anxiety...i just get confused because i would never want to hurt anyone at all....at times i feel like im in a dream.....im 18 and feel like im to young to be wasting my life on thoughts that deep down in my heart i know that they cant control me but i feel like my mind is playing tricks on me...i just have to let people know how i feel because i feel guilty keeping it to myself
