Hi, I'm on the  beginning of my 4th pack of combination B/C pills and at the end of the last pack, during the sugar pills, I had sex without the use of a condom. He didn't ejaculate inside me. My period came the very next day as I expected, as it always comes around the 3rd day of the sugar pill. My period is usually 3-4 days, with the last two days being pretty light, and the first days being a normal flow. However, the period I had this time was only 2 days, the normal flow dwindling by the first night and not even enough to fill a panty liner by the second day. I felt slight cramps on friday, exactly a week after the incident, however it wasn't intense and lasted less than an hour. And today, I felt very slight nausea in the morning, however I wasn't sure if this was due to nerves as I also started my first exams today. I take my pill on time quite often, 9:30pm every night, but sometimes I do forget, however if I do forget, I'll take two pills at 9:30 the next day. And I've never missed more than one pill in a row. I'm not sure wether I'm pregnant or not.
