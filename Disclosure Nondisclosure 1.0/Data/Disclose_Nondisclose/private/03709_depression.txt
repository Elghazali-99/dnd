I have taken efexorxr for a year and it worked so well it's changed my whole outlook on life!
Feel,think,act,it was a miricle....so-after a year was up my meds were no longer given to me because my grant was up and could not afford them...so i just quit them just like that..I wasn't on them anymore and i still felt good. Somthing really bad happened so I went back to the doctor; only this time it was a new one. We talked a while about what was going on and she suggested limictal to me...I've been taking 200mg for a while now --went back to the doctor and told her I was on effexor before so she decided that would probably work in my favor so I'm taking the smallest amount possible of the efexor along with the limictal. I've been taking it together for a couple of weeks now, but have noticed it's interfering with my concentration, pluss it's almost iffy that I may be back where I started...could it be that I havn't taken it long enouph? or maybe the chemical are going through transition?
