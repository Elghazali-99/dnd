We have been in a relationship for a long time, we were engaged and she stated that she loved me more than anything. I was very patient, i have forgiven many times. She would cry and i would come back to her, but one night she texted me wanting a break-up. And that was my boiling point, i tried very nice and then i started saying mean words. So this scenario happened 3 time, me begging , she denies and i go 'Loco". After the third time i said to myself never contact her again, she later contacted my mother stating she will call the police. For what? I never threatened to her or something just casual mean words every boy friend says to her gf. My problem was that i was too nice and now the difference is huge. So after a month of NC she reactivates her profile, blocks me then after two days unblocks me. I know this because she popped up at my friend suggestion. So what is she trying to do now, i blocked her two days later. So what is with these mind games, i never wanted to play it but she obviously is from the start. What is the meaning of this blocking then unblocking? I am obviously not over her, i miss the memories not her.
