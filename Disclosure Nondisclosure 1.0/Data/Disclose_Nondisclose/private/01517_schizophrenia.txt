HI guys
 My friend's mother has gone through periods of psychosis in the past..saying pple have been following her, and that pple are always spying on her and that she hears stuff from the radio when its off, and how there is a secret microphone inside her mouth so someone is spying on her, she developed violent behaviour with her 2 daughters and took out a knife. This happened after she suffered from a 2nd divorce, she didnt get any help bc her daughters were too afraid of getting her help, and flat out didnt know what to do! Now she no longer keeps friends, stopped working, stays inside all day and reads the Q'uran  (which is the muslim book) and tells pple that god will heal her and that she has spoken to him on many occassions...she is very very devout to her religion and was never before all this happened, and she hates anyone that is not Muslim when she didnt discriminate in the past. My friend hardly speaks to her bc they always end up arguing, and she doesnt know whats happening to her mother..any insights? and is it schizophrenia ...she developed this at an older age and its been 2 years since her attacks were severe
