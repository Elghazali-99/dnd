I am a manager at a restaurant and under alot of stress. This I can handle. A employee of mine that I had to write up because of failing to follow company guidlines, filed a bogus EEOC claim against me saying that she heard from someone that I called her old. ( we are the same age). She then started to constantly torment me. She constanly calls me a bi*ch when no one is around and says she will get me fired if its the last thing that she does. Last week she ran a glass rack into my back causing me great pain. I went to the Dr and they put me off work. I have made several claims to my employer who is too afraid of the EEOC to do anything. She started calling my house at all hours, commenting about my daughter and makes weekly claims against me to my employer. All the while I am on a gag order. This week another employee jumped on the band wagon, I can't take this anymore.. I can not sleep, eat or do anything that I normally do. I started seeing a Dr for panic attacks and depression. My Dr wants me to go out on stress leave but I have never seen a claim go thru under stress leave. Is there anything I can do? Any agency that will help me? 
 Thank you for any suggestions!!!
