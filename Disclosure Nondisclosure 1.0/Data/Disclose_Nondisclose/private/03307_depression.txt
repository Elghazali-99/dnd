Hi, ever since I was in elementary school I've had an out of whack stomach. I missed a lot of school because of it growing up. I'm 25 years old & from a young age I've gone through every test at least once (some twice) into finding out why my stomach is causing me so much trouble. I've had 2 endoscopys done, a colonoscopy and numerous blood tests and other scans that I can't keep count of. I've been on anti depressant since I was in high school. In my early 20s I started having such bad stomach problems I began missing work and becoming a prisoner in my own home. I've gone through a handful of gastro doctors but came across one who seemed to cure me. He put me on 10mg of amitriptyline, and I saw positive results soon after. He increased me to 15 mg bc I was still not feeling 100%. I was then put on Wellbutrin and Prozac. After a year of Prozac I wanted off because it had bad sexual side effects. I've been off Prozac for 3 weeks now & I've been nauseous ever since. 24/7. I recently have been having days where I have diarrhea and I'm terrified to eat or go out of the house in case I need to go. I've missed work once since this started..I work in a pharmacy so I have an idea of side effects from medications. I've read that it takes a month for Prozac to leave your body and 6-8 weeks for the nausea to stop. I can't imagine I'm the only one in this boat???
