hey! Wells, my name is Barbara ! 19 years of age and expecting my very first baby!! My baby's dad and I have been together for only 7 months, and from the first time we met we wanted to have a kid together so badly, so we were ALWAYS trying !! We were in love!! It was with him that I was actually able to post pictures on fb, bring him around my family, because every guy before him was just temporary in my opinion =) It was the same treatment I got from him =) So anyways, during the third month of my pregnancy my hours at work started to pick up and I barely had time for him!! Oh yeah, I forgot to mention ... he's only 17 -.- I started becoming too tired to drive or catch the bus to his house, or when he came over to mines I would always be sleeping ...
I guess he got tired of the fact that he was losing me to my job. I tried to explain to him that our daughter ain't gonna be cheap and since I'm the only one working in the relationship the more hours I got from work the more better it was for all three of us financially... he couldn't handle it anymore. He left me the day before we would've made a year and immediately found a girlfriend a week later ... he doesn't attempt to show up to any of my appointments no more, he's never there for me when I'm in the hospital laying in bed hoping and praying that nothing's wrong with our kid ... he says he's going to be there for when his daughter is born and throughout her lifetime, but I don't want him hurting her the same way he hurt me </3 every one tells me to put his *** on child support, but I'm afraid that if I do I'll be arrested for  RAPE" ... he's no longer with the girl he left me for, but still won't try to work things out with me for the sake of our daughter ... I'm confused and scared of what the future holds for my daughter and I ... PLEASE HELP !!
