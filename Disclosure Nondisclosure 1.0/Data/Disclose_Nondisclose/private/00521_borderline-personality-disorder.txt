I just realized that my family member most likely has BPD.  I should have realized as I studied psychology for awhile.  When we first because close it was like she worshipped the ground I walked on, always came to me for advice, always wanted to take tons of pictures together whenever we were around, would tell me she couldn't wait to see me again and loved me like a best friend or sister.  This went on for several months but there would be some times where she would kind of stop talking to me so much and I noticed she was making these grand proclamations about other people (new friends) instead of me.  Then she'd come back to me and I was surprised because all she would talk about was how much she hated those same people - for very irrational reasons (aka "she didn't like my post on Facebook").
 Now all of a sudden she stopped talking to me, stopped answering me when I tried to reach her, and when I reached out to see if everything was okay she basically said leave me alone.  This is very hurtful to be rejected and thrown aside after always being there for her.
 So does this sound like she has BPD?  Is she in a "devaluing" stage with me right now?  If so, will it ever be possible to get to a normal relationship again?  It ***** as she is a bridesmaid in my wedding and she is family and it hurts to not have her supporting me anymore.
