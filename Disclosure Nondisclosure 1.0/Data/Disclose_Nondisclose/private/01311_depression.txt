I was taking Xanax from Sep.2006 til Oct of 2009. My doctor decided I need to start weening from it in July. I decreased my dose gradually til I was completely off it it. But I do have to say it was possibly the most physically draning thing I ever did. When I first started taking xanax I started at a dose of .5mg 3x per day. Then my doctor increased me to 1mg 3x a day. I then after a few months increased my own dose here and there til I was up to 6 to 8mg per day. EVERYDAY!!  I was constantly "out of it". To be honest those 3 years are just simply all a little blurry to me. But anyhow my question is.........I have been having alot of twitching in my face since  I quit and also I was having terrible pain in my feet. They felt "tender" is the only word to describe it. Has anyone else had these syptoms of withdrawals with xanax??? 
 If I can give any advoce to anyone I would like it to be if you dont need to Xanax to function dont ever get the habit started. Its one of the hardest things Ive ever had to quit in my life
