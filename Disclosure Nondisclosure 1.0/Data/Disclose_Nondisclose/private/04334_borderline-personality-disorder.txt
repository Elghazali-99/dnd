i havent had a diagnosis but i feel as if i suffer from the same thing that some people here do. i dont know what to do about it. im 14 and i dont really have any friends, as i find it difficult to connect with people, and not many people will give me the benifit of the doubt when it comes to me. its just - i need to talk to someone who knows what its like. my mum is trying to help, but she doesnt get it. i just feel like no body cares about me. i think about death quite a lot, and how easy it would be for me to just end it. i want to, but i dont know how to. i also used to cut, but not a lot. my mum would see the cuts and want me to talk to her about it. im not any good with feelings, so i just say what she wants to hear and i carry on feeling like utter ****. the only way i can feel better is by breaking something or crying. i just feel like nobody understands, and i suppose my question is, what can i do to stop it, and can someone let me know that i am not alone.
