Hi, I have just come across this site.  I am 7 days off Effexor after being on a 300mg dose for 4 years.  I also have quetiapine at night to help me sleep.  I have been experiencing what now seems to be normal side effects - brain zaps, different emotional states, crying for the first time in years, anger, frustration which is very hard for my husband and children and I just feel like a failure.  I don't know if this is co incidence but I also have what feels like flu - aching body, sore throat, no energy.  I am unable to join in normal daily activity with the family and this is making me feel more isolated.  I am unable to distinguish whether I am experiencing all withdrawal symptoms?  Or do I just have the bad luck of having flu while withdrawing?  I also have such terrible neck and shoulder pain.  Today I think it has struck a nerve which is going down my shoulder and arm.!!!  HELP!  Please tell me this is all going to improve!  I want to be off  this medication so desparately!
