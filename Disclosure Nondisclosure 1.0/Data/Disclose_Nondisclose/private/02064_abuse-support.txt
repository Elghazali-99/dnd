Here it is straight up
 Im addicted to alprazolam and alcohol. I drink a mickey of Whiskey about 3-5 times a week and I abuse my alprazolam that my doctor gave me for agoraphobia. I have been trying to take less of the alprazolam, but when I do that, I feel like I have to drink alcohol to make up for the lack of the alprazolam. My doctor gave me 10 more pills every months because I told him that I was taking more than I am supposed to. But even with the 10 pills extra, I still finish my bottle before the month is over. I really like the feeling when I take the pills.... They make me sleepy and I feel very relaxed. When I drink alcohol I feel somewhat the same, relaxed but I have a buzz. about 1 year ago I could not leave my house without feeling like "I HAVE TO GET BACK HOME NOW" even when going to my mailbox which is about a 30 second walk. Now I go fishing all the time, I take my kids out to places I thought I would never be able to go to, and I feel like I am ready to start a career. I will not leave my house without taking alprazolam and I will not leave my house without having some extra pills with me. I feel alot more indepenent now, but at the same time I am dependent on the pills I take. As for the alcohol I cannot stop. I say "ok I will not drink for a week" but I end up making excuses to drink and not keeping the promise I made to my fiance and to myself. If someone could give me some insight on what I should do, I think it would be very helpful.
