I was diagnosed with ADHD, depression, and anxiety (not sure if generalized or social).
 I have been taking Celexa 40mg for 8 months and Adderall 20mg XR for 2 months.
 Celexa initially worked well—felt genuinely happy and anxiety mostly disappeared. Quickly—however—negative side-effects surfaced and continue to worsen to this day:
-More apathetic
-Reduced affect display and emotional response
-Difficulty feeling and discerning emotion
-Libido almost non-existent
-Little enjoyment in things I usually enjoy
 I feel Celexa's negatives outweigh its positives. I like that it reduces anxiety, but it doesn't help with depression at all anymore(aside from decreasing rumination and self-defeat).
 Introducing Adderall helps substantially with my attention, socializing, cognition, learning, and interest. However—toward the evening after an XR dose (usually 8 hours later)—the negative effects of Celexa previously listed worsen. Then the following day is marked by apathy and irritability. Symptoms improve after one day of no Adderall (and a break helps prevent tolerance). Taking Adderall also increases my heart rate, and I feel physically more nervous, despite anxious thoughts not being present. I would like to remain on Adderall, as the treatment for my ADHD has given me a substantial boost in confidence and learning, which has been invaluable and overshadows its negatives.
 The ideal treatment plan would allow for a decreasing of depression/apathy, anxiety, and attention-deficiency. The current cocktail I'm on gives rise to too many counterproductive side-effects.
 What should I do?
