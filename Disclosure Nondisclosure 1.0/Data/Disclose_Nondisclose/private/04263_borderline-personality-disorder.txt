My daughter has been dating someone for over 3 1/2 yrs. and he has always adored her and treated her like a goddess.  But just out of the blue last week he got very angry and told her that he needed some time to find himself.  She has tried to communicate with him to ask him what is going on and he avoids her.  Then this week a bunch of her friends and herself went bowling and he was rubbing her back picking out a bowling ball for her, etc. like he always used to be and then the next day she saw him (they live in the same apt. complex and work at same restaurant) and he totally ignored her and would not even speak to her.  He is being rude to everyone that he used to be friends with and exhibiting anger towards them.  I am beginning to think that he has some type of mental disorder, not sure what but it just doesn't add up.  She is very confused, hurt and angry and I just want to try to help her sort this out.  If in fact he is dealing with some type of mental disorder I want to be able to help him if we can.
