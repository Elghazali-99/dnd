Just this year I broke up with my partner of 8 years who abused me. She is an alcoholic and drug abuser. I saw a couple of counselors during my very low times. One was for me and one was for couples therapy. While seeing each of them it was suggested that I also go to Al Anon. 
 I am now away from my former partner and with another woman who is not at all an abuser of alcohol, drugs, or me. I have a lot of work to do for myself and we both know that. She would like to see me go to Weave for therapy since they specialize in abuse towards women. I agree, but I don't have the money to pay for any counseling services at all and don't have insurance either. 
 When I have suggested going to Al Anon, she kind of lectures me about why I shouldn't because I am no longer in a relationship with an alcoholic. When I try to explain that I have developed behaviors that are specific to spouses of alcoholics, she still doesn't get it and I'm not good and explaining it because I am such a coward. My mind goes blank, I fill with fear, and then I say ok, agree, or do anything to get out of the conversation. 
 Am I right in wanting to go to Al Anon or is a waste of my time? If I should go, what do I say to explain that I am still a victim of my old behavior? I want to talk to her so that she hears me, but I am so afraid of being wrong while I'm trying to explain something I think is right. I feel like in the end, she is probably right because her life is on track. Mine isn't so obviously the choices and way I think must be wrong.
 Just writing this, I see how I sound. No wonder I'm so messed up! I'm a spineless wonder.
