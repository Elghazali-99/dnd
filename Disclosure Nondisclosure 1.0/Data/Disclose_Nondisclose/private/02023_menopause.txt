Apologies if this in the wrong place, I just couldn't find anywhere suitable. I have been a wide range of issues, but since the start of the year I have gained a lot of weight and generally felt unwell. I have put on so much weight, trousers and shorts that I was wearing in FEB/MARCH, no longer fit, at times I look pregnant. I took myself for some private blood tests due to some other symptoms and these are the results - Both my FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH are not within in the normal range for the follicular phase. FSH 1.5 IU/L and LH 1.0 IU/L. Previous to this I had the FSH tested in the Luteal Phase with a test result treading 0.7 IU/L. I had to have these done privately and on  the results it was suggested to see GP about my Pituitary Gland. Saw my GP who said they are normal, and they just show fertility levels. Do I just take their word for it and carry on as normal or do I push for tests? 
 On top of the weight gain I have had loose and explosive bowel movements, which you would think would cause weight loss, but hasn't. It has been like this for 3-4 weeks. Sorry to be a pain, I haven't been back to GP since they dismissed my first results and I don't have money to go private as I am unemployed. 
 I saw a GP privately the other day, very short appointment, but they want to rule out premature ovarian failure. I know most would say my FSH would be high, but not if it was secondary ovarian failure.
 I must say I am a little worried, they said I should see my normal GP and request a referral to a gynoe for further tests. I really don't think I have it in me to request it. I am so down because I just don't feel right, I know they don't listen to a word I say, I felt unwell for a long time and have had to keep going back because they take it no further. I just don't know what to do at all with this.
