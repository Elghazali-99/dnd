I am a 14 year old boy i used to live with my grandmother but then i moved in with my dad i moved up to tenesee with him and things went great for like 3 weeks but the we got in our first fight he got mad over little stuff and just blew up at me i was talking to him normal saying i was sry for it and he hollered at me and i said back u dont have to be so mean i was saying i was sry and he jumped up outta his chair and shoved me to the group which got me really mad so i got up and started hollering at him and we fought for like 30 mins till my stepmom stoped us it wasnt a fist fight it was a arugment but he told me i wasnt his son and i told him good cause i dont want to be your son. Now it seems like everyday he remeinds me that my mom is a hore because she does escort services and that my grandmother is a crackhead and i keep trying to tell him it doesnt help when u remind me of what they do it only makes me feel worse so anyways yesterday we got in our biggest fight yet and he told me i was just a liablilty and that i was the worse so ever and then he hit me across my head as hard as he could mulitple time and my dad is a very big man he left knots on my head and the past few weeks he keeps telling me nobody likes me and nobody cares about me and how he doesnt want me around and im thinking on just running away and never coming back i just dont know what to do i have very bad depression and i have almost killed myself 3 times now but then i relized that i have to much to live for i just dont know if i can keep putting up with this i feel like the whole world hates me and i cant concetrate on my school work or anything else i had to move away from all my friends and my dad makes me do homeschool now so i have no friends to talk to or hang out with i have a little bro but he is only 9 and a big sister but she hates me she tells me all the time that she hates me and she like to throw stuff at me and hit me and if i try to say anything to her her BF gets in my face and tells me he will beat my face in if i disrespect my sister and she is the one hitting me what do i do im so lost im scared of what might happen in the future.
