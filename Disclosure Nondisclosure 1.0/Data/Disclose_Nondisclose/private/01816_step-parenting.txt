Hello,
I am reasonably new to step- parenting and I ask these questions knowing I have much to learn. I am also respectful of the fact that these kids are my partner's and she has every right to choose the way her kids are raised. I by no means want to upset any systems or routines she has et in place. I have been welcomed into her family and I want to honor that in the way I treat her kids.
My partner is often very tired as she has a demanding job and also suffers from chronic pain. As a result, she often takes the path of least resistance with her kids, allowing them to do whatever they want, whenever they want, at the penalty of them screaming and crying if they do not get their way. She gives in just to have a moment of peace. The result is that they are not used to be told no about anything they demand to do, so when she leaves them with me, I cannot set any boundaries for acceptable behavior. I feel as if I have to just let them do whatever they want, because they won't listen I me and will scream and cry and even kick and hit me if they don't get what they want. My partner sometimes sees this behavior and will verbally respond to it but will do little else apart from that to discipline the behavior. I don't mean physical discipline, just clear and consistent boundaries.
I love my partner and I honestly love her kids, but I'm unsure how to be with them, especially when she gives me the responsibility to take care of them when she is at work.
Any tips and advice would be great, as i truly wish to be a loving and supportive partner, and also be a positive influence on her kids. I don't want to come in and change things, but I feel uncomfortable with allowing bad behavior when I'm in charge and I don't agree with their response to me when I set boundaries.
