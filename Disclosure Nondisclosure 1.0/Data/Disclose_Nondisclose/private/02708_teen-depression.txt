I am 15 years old and I've always been happy , im just someone who everyone knows as a very bright person. In november I started to feel sick and I thought it was just a flu or maybe even mono because I showed signs. I lost lots of weight , slept all the time , barely came out of my room. I was hospitalized but all they found was a virus. I was given meds and everything was fine. I recently have noticed that I am loosing weight and sleeping a lot again except this times its coming with a lot of tears and sad days , and i mean everyone has their sad days but I've seem to have had a lot. I am also a dancer , I love to dance but recently , I don't want to go. I feel empty and sad and guilty everyday and Ive had enough. Today is Bell lets talk and my mom and i talked about mental illness. i dont want to tell her I've been sad lately because maybe this is a phase. I figured I would find a forum where maybe i could talk to someone who has or has been through a mental illness who might be able to just help me out :)
