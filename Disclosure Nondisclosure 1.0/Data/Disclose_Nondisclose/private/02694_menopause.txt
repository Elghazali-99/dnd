I had everything out due to a complex ovarian cyst and probable endometriosis. 
 Vaginal cuff created, everything else out. 
 I was thrown into surgical menopause immediately. I haven't addressed whether or not to try hormone therapy yet. 
 I am battling too many symptoms to even count and could ask questions on at least 5 issues. 
 But for now, the worst one is the dryness, especially the dry eyes and nasal passages. It's bad enough that I have vaginal dryness and probable vaginal atrophy as well. 
 But what is really bad is the dryness in my eyes and nasal passages. It is to the point of needing artificial tears and nasal saline ALL the time. I've been to eye doctors for this too. They suggested plugs but I'm not too excited to go that route. 
 What I am specifically battling is when I sleep. I am woken up every 2/3 hours as is for vaginal and bladder aching so I have to get up to urinate. However, the dry eyes are so bad after sleeping for those couple hours, I have severe pain in my eyes, they hurt so much, feel like glass, cause headaches. I feel like my lids are stuck to my eyeball. 
 I don't know what to do anymore. I get severe headaches due to the dryness too.
 What can I do to get a good nights sleep if I can't lubricate my eyes WHILE I sleep? :(
