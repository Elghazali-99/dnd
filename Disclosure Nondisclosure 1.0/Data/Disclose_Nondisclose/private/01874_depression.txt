Although I have no problem remembering facts and figures and my short term memory is better than most, I have no long term memory of events. I know it's normal not to remember childhood, but I don't remember high school or college or anything I did there. In fact, my oldest memory is looking outside and seeing chairs on the lawn at my mom's birthday. That was two weeks ago and there only seems to be a vague, blank space before it. Memories just fade after a few weeks. It's a real problem in personal relationships because I can't remember anything me and someone else did together or said to each other, unless I memorize it by repeating it over and over. It's just not normal. I worry that when I get children I will not remember a single significant event of their lives. 
 I've had this for a long time (not that I can remember, but I keep a diary) and I wonder if there's anything I can do or if it might be related to the depression I've had in the past. I was diagnosed as mildly depressed at 12 but got better at about 17-18, with depressive moods still occurring from time to time . I am now 21 years old.
 Thanks in advance for your help!
