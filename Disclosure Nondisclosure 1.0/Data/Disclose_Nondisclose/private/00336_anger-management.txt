My second son has always been a little more moody/angry/needy. However within the last 6-8 months he has gotten to the point that we're worried for him. We just assumed it was normal little boy behavior, until he started showing more and more anger. Its mainly at home but he will slowly start showing it at the baby sitters and is now starting to at pre school. Here are some examples;
If he doesn't get his way or if his feelings get hurt he snaps instantly. 
Earlier he asked for a drink, I told him, "Ok, give me just one minute to finish changing your sister and I will. What do you want?" And bamn he snapped because I wasn't instantly getting it. He will hit himself full force. (Never hits me nor his little sister and brother, however he occasionally will his big brother ). He'll say that he hates me or that he hates himself. Full force tantrum, stomping, throwing anything in front of him, screaming (to the point I worry the neighbors will be  concerned) occasionally spit, and the final straw that is making me seek help for him.. He has started to tell us hes going to kill himself or walk in front of a bus! :'-( hes 4!  We don't have cable and have never spoke like that in front of him,  how in the world would he even grasp something like that. So worried. When he isn't this angry hes such a sweet loving boy. I seem to be able to calm him easier than others and his love for his baby sister and brother is over flowing. His anger is never towards them in fact hes like a baby whisperer. :) but I desperately want to help my son with his anger and now his school is requesting it as well. Help?
