I am a 19 year old white male. I would consider myself a hypochondriac. I have off and on worried about dying since I was around sixteen. I had gal bladder surgery just five months ago. Now, these are my symptoms. I don't have strong head aches or anything like that. Sometimes I just get head pains. The only real places I get these head pains are just over my eyes, or right above my ears. I still get nauseated every once in a while after I eat, which I am guessing is normal after gal bladder surgery. My wisdom teeth are coming in so my jaws are tight, but I grind my teeth in my sleep, which is a recent thing. I get a soreness in the back of my head about three times a week. I always feel very full in my ears, throat, forehead, and cheeks.  I went to my doctor about a month ago and he had me do a CT Scan of my sinus. Everything came back fine. He did a few blood tests of my liver, just to make sure everything was alright after my surgery. Everything was fine. No medicine really has helped me that I have taken, but when I do get small head aches Tylenol takes care of it. Recently I have been very stressed and I have had a history of anxiety attacks. Are those two things the source of my problem?
