I'm 50 years old and my last period was 6 years ago. Been on Divigel 1 mg and Prometrium 100 mg almost two years (I had hot flashes and insomnia). 8 months ago developed monthly bleeding, was tested and a polyp was removed from my uterus 2 months ago. I have no cancer cells and the lining is normal. I didn't have any infection before the surgery.  However, after the surgery had some discharge and fewer and was on antibiotics for two weeks. Also developed yeast infection that was taken care.  However,  the bleeding now continues after the surgery (even though the polyp is removed), approximately every 2 weeks.  It lasts 5-6 days.  It increases when I lift something. It is bright red and quite heavy bleeding.  My doctor says it is most likely because of the HRT…  so is this something normal I should just get used to it (bleeding every second week for 5 days???) Should I decrease the Divigel and Prometrium or increase Divigel (if Prometrium is thinning my lining…)? Could this be a infection caused by the surgery? Or could this have something to do with unbalanced thyroids? I have extreme fatigue, sleeplessness, insomnia…  Thank you for your help.
