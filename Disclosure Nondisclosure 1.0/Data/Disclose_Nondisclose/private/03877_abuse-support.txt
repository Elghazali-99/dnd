well me and my husband have been married for eight months now but we only new eachother a month before we got married but that was because he is in the military and in order to live together we have to be married but weve gotten use to it now. i would say a few months after being married he started pushing me and he would push my head against the wall and ask if me if i would stop and then one time we were kinda fighting and yelling at eachother and i had his hands pinned to his sides and then he he slammed his head into my head and i got a big bump. He would tell me that he would do this to me because of his experiences in the military and i believed him so ive never blamed it on him but i still felt like i didnt deserve it. After he did that he realized that that was going way to far and he stopped doing all of that. but ive always heard that if he hits u once hes going to do it again so i wanted to plan to leave him but then i found out that i was pregnant and i felt stuck. but then it was still ok because he still hadnt done anything. recently though he has been slapping me trying to be funny but with a mans hand it does hurt. and the other night we were kind of hitting eachother playfully though and i thought it was ok, until i backed handed him, not even hard, but he took it way worse and he started to punch my leg really hard and i started crying. but i dont want to leave him. i love him too much. wat should i do
