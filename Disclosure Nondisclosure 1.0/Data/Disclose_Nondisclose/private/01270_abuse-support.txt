I was married to a narcissistic man for 30 yrs.  He emotionally, verbally, mentally, psychologically abused me.
Well, then it became physical.
He cheated on me. Divorce he asked for he got.  Yet, since I am disabled and can not work I got spousal maintenance.  Now?  He owes back pay of 578.00 dollars plus 251.00 dollars a month is his amount he suppose to give.  Well, I found out he Lied to the Judge and my Attorney about his job.  He is full time.  I found out, and told my
 attorney.  The thing is "She made a proposal."  I am only going to receive 258.00 dollars, being adding the 7.00 dollars
for back pay.  He has the money.  I don't.
 The proposal I received Saturday.  I sent my attorney an email with all the correct phone numbers she needed
 to find out he is Full Time, and makes 18.00 an hour.  He gets paid weekly.  I feel as though he is still "In
 Control" of me.  I feel re victimized!!  Should I call my Attorney?  Set an appointment time?  I am not signing
this "proposal".
 My ex's mate sent me a check in the amount of 258.00 dollars.  Should I go see my Attorney?  What do I say?
 Help needed thanks
