I had open heart surgery at the age of 46 I am now 53 yrs old. I was in a troubled marriage for 23yrs, cheating,lying.physcial and emotional abuse. I felt like I was dying inside and finally gained the strenth to divorce him at the age of 43. When I had the heart surgery at 46yrs of age I always felt it was truly due to my broken heart,marriage and family. I met the man I am now with one year before my surgery at the time I was very ill and he insisted on being there for me and he was 100 percent. He is a single father of two and I have two of my own. My daughters had a hard time with the divorce and always made my partner know that they did'nt want him around. While his two wanted and needed a mother so I was fully accepted. We have been together 8yrs and have many, many fights over my daughters,physical,verble and emotional.I left him for 2yrs and recently we moved back in together but nothing has changed. I feel indepted to him because had he not gotten me to the hospital when he did I would'nt be writing this letter,yet the distance i feel with my adult daughters and my grandchildren make me feel that the relationship is not worth all that I'm giving up. they don't come to see me I go to them. This is not my ideal of Family.I'm feeling like moving on...
