I met probably the most wonderful person I have ever met, and I have been dating him for 3 years now.  In the first year of dating him he told me he had an illness.  I would go to the doctor with him, all he told me was that it is psychotic.  Since I had bad anxieties at one time, I thought no big deal...Well then it came out, and I have to say it was kind of funny because he was telling me and eating non stop as he was talking to me.  I never stopped seeing him because other than that he has never posed a problem.  He is very respectful, nice, understanding, we have had some disagreement but nothing we both can't handle.  In fact I respect him so much because he is doing everything in his power to overcome any walls.  He is a loner, and I am very outgoing! So I take him to dinners and have him around many people.  My friends are his friends.  There will be one or two people that say I deserve better, but I feel that we met for a reason.  I trust him...He is great, and I have a teenage daughter that I have 50/50 custody and he has been excellent with her.  He see's all her plays, and sits in the front row.  My daughter loves him very much.
 Am I crazy to love this guy?  I will tell you the truth, just hearing the word schizophrenia is scary because the way Hollywood portrays it.  I just decided to go with a gut feeling, and be there for him.  There is a portion in my relationship that I do take care of him.  I try to organize his thoughts.  I converse with him often, calling him through out the day.  I stay with him on the weekends (he lives with his sister & brother in law) they want that for him.  We pray together when he feels confused about things. I think love is not perfect, maybe this is meant to be?
