my 5 year old step daughter is out of control...she does the same things over and over and no matter what we do she keeps doing it...over the past year her behavior has goten way wores. It when from just not listening to not useing the potty any more to distructive and physical...she is now hurting her little brother, sister and our pets. we are at the point where she can not be left alone at all at we even have locks on all the doors and cabenits in the house out of fear of what she will do next...her 2 year old sister is terrified of her. over the past week she asked if her and her sister could go in her room to play...out of bad jugment i told her yes as long as she left the door open...not even 20 minuts later the younger one was scream i ran in the room to find the 5 year old cuting the 2 year olds hand open with a light bulb that she broke. she looks at me like it means nothing, then she blams it on her younger sister. then the very next day she randomaly came up to me and her dad and sed the cat eat the turtles feet (we do not have a cat). i found the turtle alive but with no feet and laying next to the turtle was his feet and a bloody fork...after we found the fork she addmitted to doing it in the middle of the night. her dad is in complet denial. he says she doesnt know what she is doing and she is just 5 years old that she is acting out...I know there is something seriously wrong with her but im just the step mom....i dont know what to do...and i dont think i can live being scared of a child...HELP!!! PLEASE!!!
