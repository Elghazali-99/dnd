I started a new job this past week, and I feel like I have been singled out.  I wasn't trained very well the first day.  The next two days on was on the floor all by myself.  Well last night they paired me up with another host.  
No one seems to understand how I felt and if they did they wouldn't care.  I have not worked in 3 years and I am still trying to find myself.  When I go to ask a question what everyone else wants is more important.  I don't want to be haysed, because I am not in high school anymore.
To make matters worse I am not being listened to about not being able to work on a certain day of the week.  I feel so stressed out and I really want to quit, but my husband won't let me.  I am not even going to make enough money for it to matter, we are still going to be deep in debt with all of the money that we have borrowed from family members.  
I have spent most of my time at home crying, and looking for a different job.  After the surgery I had several years ago.  I feel like I lost a lot of myself.  I am overwhelmed, and stressed.  I can't sleep at night, all I do is stay awake for hours and cry.  Everyone is giving me different directions, and telling me to do things differently,  I am so confused, upset and mad.
I have no idea what I am supposed to do.
