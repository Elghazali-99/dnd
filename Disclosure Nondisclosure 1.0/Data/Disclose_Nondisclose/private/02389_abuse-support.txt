I feel so low. I can't stop these feelings in my head and in my body. I was groomed and abused by my dad for years and it came to it's worst point when I was 8. But he beat my mum so my mum never saw it. He treated me like his girlfriend, we did everything together like a couple and I even imagined we'd end up together, get married etc and have sex regular. I remember that when he abused me physically I let it happen even though it confused me as I thought it was an odd game. I liked the love and attention though and we were inseperable. He was always rude with me and I played his game. The thing is though, the abuse to my mum and domestic violence got so bad that she had to flee and she took us. I never saw him again except a few times. I haven't seen him now for years though, not since I was about 13. The problem is I have all these unwanted sexual feelings towards him. We were like humbert and lolita in the film lolita, and I have become obsessed with that film and fantasize about it, as if I wish it were me and my dad and i end up wishing things had gotten more sexually heavy. I somehow think if i had had sex with him then maybe these frustrating and confusing feelings wouldn't be there. But i didn't, he just kissed me intimitely, took naked pictures of me and flirted outrageously. I think he was confused too. I dont know how to get rid of these feelings and its affecting and ruining every relationship i have with a man. i always go into my fantasy world and become that 8 year old i once was when i was told i was perfect and try to make my partner live it as if he were taking my innocence. Something about it turns me on i guess, even when i look at pictures of my dad I have all these feelings down there. I can't stop it and i don't want it. I don't want to feel that way and i don't want to lust after my dad. I feel so confused and damaged. I just want to be normal. Please help.
