I am hoping you could help me.  I have been experiencing many peri-menapausal symptoms including sleeplessness, hair loss, fatigue, dryness, dry eye, bloat, irregular periods, and mood swings (may be leaving some out).  My OB/GYN put me on the pill to help my symptoms but I had an awful reaction to it i.e., chest pain, anxiety, shortness of breath.  He then prescribed an anti-anxiety pill, which I did not take.  I began doing a lot of research and have come to the conclusion that I would like to try a bioidentical compound.  I asked him about it but he does not deal with bioidenticals.  I asked if I could have my hormones tested, which he did.  My results confirmed my suspicions that I am peri-menapausal.  Results are as follows: FSH 31.7, LH 15.5, Estradiol <6, Prolactin 2.8, TSH 1.9, T4 (FREE) 1.01.   The doctors notes indicate I could start Prempro .625/2.5 as a trial as a result of my testing.  I would like to go the natural route.  Instead I chose to start Emerita, a progesterone cream, and am now on day 4 and have begun spotting and am very bloated. I am only using one packet a day as I figured I would start slow.  I also ordered an estrogen cream on amazon.  Am I headed in the right direction?  Any help you can offer or advise would be greatly appreciated!
