i'm 19 years old and i have been living in germany with my family. in the begining my senior year of highschool i struggled a little(normal) but after awhile i was back to being happy and confidant, ofcourse i had my moments of doubt. but after graduation i was suppose to go to the AF but decided to stay to try to work things out with my boyfriend. our relationship was stressful and well we ended up breaking up all the time cause i wasn't sure of my feelings and felt unhappy and since then i have been felling lost,confussed and depressed. i feel so alone cause all my friends left to college and i really only had two friends and my boyfriend.and well i thought getting rid of my boyfriend casused of the stress would help me but i been feelin worse.and i don't know if i have so much time on my hands that i make up ideas or reasons why i'm alone and well lately forsome reason i can't seem to get the qustion if i like girls just because of a dream i have never been attracted to a girl or anything. and i try to distract myself but while i'm trying to thing of me in the future and lookin for the perfect guy my head stops spinning to "oh your gonna end up with a girl" i don't know why this happens. is it just that i'm not keepin myself busy or are these thoughts something else?? also i saw a small part of girl on girl action and it excited me and that scared me and that triggered all these thoughts and questions what do i need to do!!
