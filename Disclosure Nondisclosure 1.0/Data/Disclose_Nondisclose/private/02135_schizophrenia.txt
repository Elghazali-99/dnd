Did you know that ginkgo biloba accentuates antipsychotic medications as well as alleviates side effects of those medications?  I learned this from the web.  Be careful; it would be best to get a psychiatrist's help, if you have one who knows anything about herbal meds (mine does not).
 I have been on ginkgo for over three months now, and I have found that I need to reduce meds (slightly), but had been having fewer side effects (restlessness, slight quivering of tongue ended) on the higher dose.
 There is a study on the web for a three-month treatment with Haldol and ginkgo that looks very good.  Be sure to search the web if you are going to go it alone (not recommended).  If you have diabetes, you can't take ginkgo; and if you fall, there is an increased risk of a subdural hematoma (blood clot between the brain and the skull).  Otherwise, there are some really good side effects.  I have noticed memory improvement, though this has not been borne out in studies on the web.
