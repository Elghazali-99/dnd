i am petrifed of HIV i have so many symptoms - white tongue, muscle ache, sickness, nausea, peeling skin, dry mouth, hoarseness, acne, jaundice, panic attacks, sweats, ulcers, fatigue strnage blood results, rashes, etc
I know some of these symptoms are stress related - but I have had a total of 8 tests with two tests for HIv each time - at 6 weeks, 8, 10, 14 weeks 5months 5.5 months, 6.5 and 7 + months after the single incident. All tests were p24 antigen and antibode fourth gen test and each time a second blood sample was sent off for an ELISA test - all negative thank God. 
 yet still all these symptoms now have developed really swollen glands and asthma! (wheezing) My GUM consultant says no more testing, My GP suggests I'm HIV OCD and yet she acknowledges my real symptoms and says I have elevated WBC (a mystery virus) increased bilirubin 22 - 25 (Gilberts???) thyroid elevation -  but this is going on 8 months and the symptoms are still present.
 I know am in great anxiety and even though I noted how when I went to an ENT who told me my white tongue wasnt thrush - and then the white tongue disappeared. I realise this might be psycosamatic (sic) but could all these symptoms really be brought on by 24 7 60 min stress where i search the net for hours every day, looking for every symptom every story. What do I do? I can't stop testing nor move on with my life - keep reading of people who serconvert later than my 7months + (one guy up to 4 years later - real or net myth)
