Ive posted about the same issues before and at first it started well. I'm now 17 years old, and a year ago I finally opened up and told my mom about the sexual abuse I went through as a kid. Apparently  it's been classified as rape...and as I have started to remember some suppressed memories I can see why. My problem is that it all started off well, I started seeing a therapist, went to the police with my mom and told my story. Moved out of my dad's place. I started to feel better.
But it's now one year later and I can't even bare it anymore. The issues are still,I have a huge fear of touching people, or whenever someone touches me I can't stop myself to flinch. And many don't know why I do that so they punish me with hurtful words or with jokes that really aren't that funny. But I can't help it, I'm really trying to change. I'm so scared to have a relationship and the expectations of one. The crying and anxiety is back, every morning at school I have to rush to the bathroom and sit there for 15 minutes before I can calm myself down. And I've stopped caring, i dont care what people or teachers require from me anymore...I'm so exhausted! This heavy weight of whatever on my chest won't go. 
What's wrong with me? I'm seriously considering anti depressants.
