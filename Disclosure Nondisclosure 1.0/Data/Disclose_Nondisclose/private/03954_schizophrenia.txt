Can someone help me understand why a person with schizophrenia in a relationship would want to spend less and less time with their partner and come up with more and more silly excuses. Since a few months into the relationship (of over a year) I have to always be the one to initiate contact and my partner appears cold, unemotional and hardly ever wants intimacy or initiates hugs or conversation. 
 In any other relationship I would take this to mean the relationship is ending, but the last time I asked him if he wants to finish he flew off the handle and said 'you always say that', and for me to stop asking him because I should just know doesn't want to do that' I replied by asking 'why doesn't he want to see me or do anything with me then?' and he shouted me to 'shup up' and stop going on about it. 
 I'm so confused. It has definately got worse since they changed him from olanzepine (atypical) to a (typical) injection. His motivation and affect has gone really down, although all the people in his care team say it's been the best thing ever for him :(  I just can't seem to connect with him anymore - he's getting to be more and more like a stranger and the worry is affecting my own mental state, any insight would be great.
