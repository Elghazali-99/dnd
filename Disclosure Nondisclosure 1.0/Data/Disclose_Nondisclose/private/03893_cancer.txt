Hi there.
 I'm a 24 year old male with fair skin, blonde hair and blue eyes. I suffer from OCD and a recurring fear is losing my hair - even though I have a full head of hair - and I often check it, so I know my crown etc. quite well. I also have dermatitis or something on my scalp so often get dry skin and scab type things.
 I was checking my hair the other day and noticed a small mole-looking mark on my crown, about 3mm, looks fairly round, dark brown and, well, new. I made an appointment to see my GP and I saw her Tuesday. She looked at it, measured it etc. and said 'it didn't look particularly dodgy' but she could see two colours in it so would refer me to a dermatologist, an appointment would be sent out in about six weeks. 
 My OCD has got me thinking the worst case scenario now. Either way, I felt it before and it seems to have gone slightly scabby, and when I checked in a mirror it seems to have gone darker again. 
 I'm wondering if this sounds like something sinister, or could it be related to my dermatitis?
 Thanks.
