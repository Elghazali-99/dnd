So i see a counselor once a week every week i have now for about 8mo. my husband (soon to be ex husband) put me thru soo much!!! its been 8 mo. since i last seen him or talked to him on the phone (tho he texts me about 1 a month or every other month) we have 2 kids in common.. when i was 9 months pregnant he beat me up, an in front of our 5yr old son at that. 2 days later he cheated on me and left me for another girl, which he ended up getting her pregnant(she knew i was married and was pregnant and still contuined to mess with him), 2 months later he left her, thought i would give him another chance, to hold our family together. he ended up pulling a loaded gun to my head in an arguement about the girl he left me for, with the kids in the next room.. i found text messages to other girls saying "he to wild to be married and watches his niece and nephew" (reffering to his kids) i left him for good... tho presentdays i cant seem to shake the resentment feeling i have for the homewreck or my ex. i feel that both should suffer, neither one has own up to the responsibility for what they did, my ex yeah thats expected bcz he selfish and will probably never grow up (tho he talks how he leading this great life, but contuines to put me down) but as for her she just looks for attention and sympathy from her "situation" which she lies and doesnt realize she tore my life up with her selfishness. why should she get all the boohoos its been almost 2year for her. grant it my ex did all the damage to me, an i will forever hate him.. our son he says he doesnt have a daddy, bcz he mean and -he did hurt us an was very neglectful with our kids . and that hurts bcz who will do father son activies (not saying a want my ex back bcz of that just someone new but seems like it would be forever or hard to let someone get close to me..) i try to let all the feelings go, i in no way make conversations with either of them or anything like that. i just hurt...
