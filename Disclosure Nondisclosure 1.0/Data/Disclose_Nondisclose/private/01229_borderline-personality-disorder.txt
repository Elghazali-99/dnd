My bf father passed away when he was 10 and his parents got divorced before that he used to tell me how upset he would get when his mom and dad fought in front of him and when he saw his dad hurt his mom, he never went for help or spoke to anyone about it. He liked to party and use to sms me things like I feel so empty you won’t understand not even the alcohol would fill it
we had a stunning relationship we did so much together was so in love went on our roadtrips, did crazy cocktail evenings at home or had scrabble games at home it was incredible he said he loves me and all my friends could see how crazy he was about me and how crazy i was about him we use to celebrate our anniversaries every month at a different restaurant and all in all it was just amazing. then we had a fight I got upset as he kept on flirting with girls and then he got upset but he got so upset that he got in his car and left we tried to look for him and 4 hours later found him in a 24 hour restaurant he was UPSET he was ranting and raving about how can a pretty girl like you be so full of **** and I can’t believe it I only pulled out the chair for the woman and then he got even more upset and took a plate and smashed it against the wall then we left we got home he was crying i held him and asked him what is wrong what is hurting you so badly and he said that he does not know still crying he said he does not know what he wants anymore. the next morning he left for work and sms me to say that he will bring the cleaning lady the next morning but he wants to break up so i asked why and he just said it will be best 
The Next morning he brought in the cleaning lady. He was tired he went to lie on the couch staring into nothing with tear in his eyes then he fell asleep woke up said he had to leave he was so distant and cold so he left then 45 min later he came and did my fish tank’s pump for me, when he got there he was a different person alive and happy he fixed up the tank and realized he needs a new pump so told me he will get one the next day
he kissed me and left. next day he sms to say he is going to buy a new pump and I told him that is fine but I am not at home but he is more than welcome to do it. then later he asked me where I am and I said I am on my way home are you still there when I got there he sms me to say he had to leave to go and get dressed for his sister bday party and will I come with him so I said yes sure I will go so we to his sisters birthday and when we finished he walked me to my car and I turned around and asked whats going on here now are we broken up or what and he said he doesn’t know how do you know how can you be sure this is the right one how don’t you  know there is someone better out there so I told him if that is how you feel fine but it either off or on between us then he said well lets just see how it goes and I told him I am not going to be stringed along and I am sure he can understand So he said yes ok we together and then everything went back to normal and it was awesome even better than before it was great lovely and it was like that for a few months again then one day we were just irritated with each other he starting sayings things like see we can’t even see eye to eye how can we waist anymore of each other’s time this is not going to work you know what this is over I want to be single I don’t want this relationship anymore it just does not feel right anymore I don’t feel the same anymore and dropped me off and got in his car and left. The next day I got an sms to say he feels his fire is out and dead he feels that he is soo tired of putting up a happy go lucky sharrade in front of all the people. So I left it and did not hear from him for a week. 
He sms after a week to say that he is coming to my house the Saturday to come and bring me neon’s fishies for my fish tank. He came around put my fishies in and then asked me if I want to go and do something we headed off to the beach and bang we where back together and things was awesome and we he moved in with me and it was awesome we were so in love he showered me with presents it was great we were in love talked about marriage and this carried on for a long time and then boom we went to a braai he started drinking and he changed then 2 other woman walked into the room and he changed even more he spend the whole night chatting to them like I am not even in the room and then to top it off when I wanted to leave he told me that I am a drunk $%#$ so I told him nicely firstly that is not the way to speak to me  and I feel that you are not attentive to me I am here with you at a braai and I would rather want to go home than sit here all by myself whatever you are doing it is not nice for me so I got in my car and left. He never came home that night I phoned him the morning he went off about how could I get in my car and left and if I just stayed everything would have been fine and we would have gone home and that was that that everyone was drinking and partying and that he told everyone and in front of everyone well if this is why she got in her car and left and if these girls are the reason why she left then it’s over between us and grabbed the girl and kissed her in front of all his friends and got in his car and drove none stop and told me so I kissed her I kissed her so I cheated on you as well so deal with that info with it what you want to. Next day spoke to him and told him that I am sorry for my part of it but what happened to him. He just told me that he loves me he does not know what to say he just need some head space to sort out his feelings. So I left it for the week he still slept in our bed and he still acted as if we together.
After week I asked him if we can chat about things and he went off “there is nothing to talk about, I don’t feel the same way this is not how I pictured our future that is not how I pictured my future, and its killing me inside I know what I am giving up and it is tearing me inside I know what I am throwing away, but I will rather start with someone new than have to do damage control I am tired of damage control and I am moving out . So I left it the week he slept in the spare room and the Saturday morning acted as if nothing is wrong is playful with me and loving and kind and went to fetch his trailer started packing stuff so I confronted him and said ok well are you sure this is what you want to do and then he went off crying and said “ I don’t know if I want this suburban life of ours, yes there is never a dull moment and yes we have our odd complications and yes I won’t ever find anyone that does the things you do but is it worth it is it really worth it, I am tired of the healthy living and I am tired of this and that and that I just feel something is missing and I feel dead and that I don’t even feel hurt by what I am doing I feel hurt because I know what this relationship means to you but I don’t know if I can  love you for the rest of my life and I don’t know if I am just stubborn or emotionally low right now but that how I feel and its not you it was not like that from the beginning and that he is making himself unhappy. There is still stuff at my house his big two fish tanks and few boxes this Saturday he sms me to ask me what am I doing and can he come over and bring me some neon fish he came over walked into my door kissed me and spend 4 hours there in the cleaning pumps and fish thanks walking around he asked me what I’m doing for the rest of the day and I did reply he then invited me to come and have a braai at his moms house. I went I just left it had supper ate and left he kissed me goodbye. Then the next evening I saw him in a club with his new found friend, she was a friend of his that he knew before they used to hang out and party a lot. But he acted as if he is not hurt at all! He acted top of the world hopping around greeting people and acting as if he owns the place My heart broke! 
Any advice? Please I am so confused
