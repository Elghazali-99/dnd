My sister was very attached to this guy who initially made her feel that she is only one in her life, when she finally was emotionally attached to him, he made her feel that she is incompetent of the relationship and is egoistic in return just shattering her self confidence. He used to talk to her on his own terms, once or twice vanished and then again appeared apologizing. And now that I got to know about all of this I askes to leave him. Initially my sister was hesitant, but gradually she saw that she is being emotionally used. Also now she doesn't want to be with him but is not able to get over him. She has lost her confidence, is not able to study, is crying maximum times, every morning she cries and is vomiting out of stress. At times she says she is ready to go back, at least he would be around. Also she says that he has moved on I am not able to move on, I am stuck and she is sad almost all the time.  This has been going since last year. But for around 2-3 months me and her friends are not letting her talk to that guy. And she blaming herself for everything. Please Help! Do you think I need to get some medical help? What should I do?
