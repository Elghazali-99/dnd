Hi, I'm a 30 year old female.  I've been undergoing a very traumatic/stressful situation for approximately 4years now, while living in another city.  Within the past year, I've noticed that my periods have stopped for the months that I was away in the other city, but return once I came back to my hometown.  I live in a constant state of stress in the other city.  I went to my doctor because I was concerned that I have been experiencing water weight gain for approximately a year now.  I don't sleep well through the night when I'm away from my home town, and the sporadic nature of my menstrual cycle gave me the greatest concern.  I feel constantly alert and stressed until I get back to my hometown.  My doctor did a blood test to check my hormone levels, and my estrogen levels where normal.  However, my FSH and LH levels were 135pg/ml for FSH and 88.9pg/ml for LH.  My thyroid hormones were normal, normal blood sugar.  Urine tests came back normal. My last menstrual cycle was at the beginning of June of 2011, and it is almost August, now. I've been reading a bit about Temporary Menopause related to Traumatic Stress.  Can anyone shed some light on that condition, or maybe an interpretation of what is happening to me physiologically?
