Hi there,
 I really need your help. My mother has been somewhat mentally unfit for a while now. It first started off with forgetfulness and lack of focus/attention approximately three years ago but over the past 5 months she's been hallucinating. We went to see a psychiatrist and they explained that she's undergoing psychosis but they are unsure as to why. Prior to any mental illness she was on levothryoxine, gliclazide and calcichew. Then they discovered her cortisol levels were low so they put her on hydrocortisone and things started going downhill from there. At first the doctor diagnosed her mental illness as depression and he put her on anti-depressants, but since the memory loss persisted and actually got worse, he stopped the anti-depressants. Then somehow her blood sugar level picked up and she no longer needs to take the gliclazide! My mother has been diabetic for about 16 years and all of a sudden she doesn't need medication!? (and she still eats biscuits etc, so her diet hasn't improved). Therefore the doctor thought it could be aggressive treatment of her diabetes and thought this could be causing some of her mental illness. He stopped the gliclazide treatment but her mental illness persisted, then he thought it could be due to the hydrocortisone, he reduced the dose to 5mg but the hallucinations has become even more frequent. Now she's not on the hydrocortisone until her next synaptic test.
 So she's currently only on the levothyroxine and the calcichew which she takes on and off. Could her condition be hypothyroidism? She used to be on 150mg about 6 months ago and this was reduced to 75mg and 1.5 weeks ago increased to 100mg. My mother has no history of mental illness and nor does our family. This happened completetly out of the blue and she's been deteriorating ever since, she's 55 and the neuropsychologist ruled out dementia because her memory hasn't detoriated. Please, please help, she's completely delusional now!
