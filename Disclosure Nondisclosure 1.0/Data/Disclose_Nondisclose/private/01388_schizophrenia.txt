Hi everyone, 
     After about four years of chronic drug use I started to develop schizophrenic tendency's, i got clean about eight months ago and have been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia since. I can't decipher what is real and what is in my head, heck I can't even figure out if I exist. I  severely overused drugs of the psychoactive nature and now i feel like i am caught in the middle of an acid trip. My psychiatrist keeps upping my meds because I have been frantic and not functioning. I hear voices and see people not to mention everything changes color and i see all the fractals and grids like when i was on LSD and frequently feel body highes like i am on MDMA. I have extreme paranoia and severe panic attacks. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist soon and i think shes just going to up my meds. All that explanation and my question is... Can schizophrenia worsen as i get older? I am only 18 and I have been researching on the internet and I've been reading that it can get much worse until about age 25.
I am also wondering if drugs are the only reason that this happened to me and if i did it to myself.
I want to know if anyone is experiencing these same issues of reality distortion.
I am taking non narcotic drugs because I am clean and sober, but it's so hard for me to sleep because my nightmares are violent and depict me killing people or others killing people. 
I am in consoling, but should i seek further help? I don't feel like i am a danger to myself or others because i have such a facade and a way of acting like everything's perfect, but i dont know what to do. 
 thanks a ton,
