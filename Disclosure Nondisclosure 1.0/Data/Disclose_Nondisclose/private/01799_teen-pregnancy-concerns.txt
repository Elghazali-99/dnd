Hi so im 17, and my boyfriend and i had protected sex 42 days ago the day right after my last period, it was both our firsts. We've had sex three more times since then too, all using a condom. i marked the day i had my period on one of thoses period apps, and that was the first time i actually marked it. Sept 13 was theday my period ended and sept 15 was the actually day we had sex. It said on the calendar that my period was suppose to come on Oct. 5 th .. its Oct. 27th.. last night my boyfriend fingered me hoping that would help start my period! i did start bleeding after i had orgasmed. i thought that made it start so i put a tampod in right after. I took it out an hour later and there was only a little blood on it and i had stopped bleeding. i was stressed in beginning of october, but after the first week i just for got about it, so ive been super calm. every once in awhile like maybe once every 3 days i get this sharp cramp but it doesnt last that long. oh and after he fingered me and i put my tampond in, it hurt, like as if i actually started, but i didnt...should i be worried? what should i do?
