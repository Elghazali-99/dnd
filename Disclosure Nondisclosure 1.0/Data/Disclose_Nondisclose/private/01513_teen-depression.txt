Ever since I was little I have alway's had an interest in the weather and mostly enjoy thunderstorms or strong winds. But of course, with the weather, it is something I cannot control, and sometimes when I get bored this is one of the things that idelly I would need in order for me to get my fix!
                    But quite often when the weather doesen't go my way I can actually get quite frustrated, and I start believing that I will never see another storm again in my life. But it is annoying because when these types of weather happen, it can suddenly make me very happy and excited. The worst is when we have been promised to get thunder but the next day it never comes, and that is normally when I can get depressed because of it not happening. I also get depressed because there doesn't seem to be many other people who are interested in the subject, and to be honest the weather is, to me anyway, the main thing that keeps me going and not just totally die of boredem with nothing else for me to do.
 Is it normal to be like this, or is there something wrong with me?
