i'm 24 yr old wife and mother. i had an extremely bad reaction to a prescription drug that has left me temporarily disabled and in protracted withdrawal from. i am currently bedbound and afraid that the stress of the past four years has compiled and caused adrenal burnout. i took a saliva test for cortisol and dhea from home because of my sensitivities to all stimulation i can not get out to a doctor's office (and my gp makes house calls but doesn't do hormone testing). i was desperately hoping that you would be able to give me your informal opinion based on my hormone test results: my am saliva cortisol was 0.23 while the reference range is 0.27-1.13, my evening cortisol was 0.06 which was within the reference range of 0.03-0.14 and my dhea was relatively high but within the refernce range at 456 range being 71-640.   i should also mention i had a thyroid test which was perfect.  also when i took that am cortisol i has just fallen asleep a half hour before and was waken up by my alarm clock to take the test so im not sure if that would affect it. do you think i should be concerned?  thanks for your time.
