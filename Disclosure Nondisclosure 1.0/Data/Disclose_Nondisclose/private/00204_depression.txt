Ok so I'm a 31 y/o female with a normal productive place in society but there's this weird thing that I do and have done for as long as I can remember where I'll have a conversation in my head with someone I know (even though its a conversation that I'm not going to have with the person ever) but instead of just in my head I say it out loud and will get stuck on how to say what I'm saying the best way,  that I repeat over and over and it can be word for word or slightly different by I cannot stop until I suddenly am aware of what I'm doing and sometimes that will put a stop to it but sometimes I can go right back to doing it without realizing. It's usually just half in my head and half quietly out loud to myself but sometimes I will find myself talking as loud as I would be normally to somebody nearby. I remember being like 8 or 9 and being aware of this and feeling extremely embarrassed if someone caught me.  Recently I feel like it is getting much worse.  I just on here about something called "looping"  behaviors? The other night when I was driving home I suddenly realized  that I had been doing it for the entire 30 min ride but what freaked me out is that I was talking very loudly but then was truly shocked when I finally did realize it. It's a devastation feeling lie control of it anymore because I don't know when it's h[happening anyone has any kind of insight to what this is I'd love to hear it.
