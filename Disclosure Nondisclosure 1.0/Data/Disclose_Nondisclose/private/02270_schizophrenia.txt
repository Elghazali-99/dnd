My doc put me on antidepressents for bulimia in the summer.  There were a few nights when, not thinking, I went out drinking.  The following night, I was sharing a room with my little brothers (we were renting a house for a family get together).  I lay on bed and started thinking that if I fell asleep or lost focus, I would hurt one of my brothers.  I was so worried that I was going to suffocate or strangle one of them, I went and woke up my mum.  I vomited all night and my mum sat up with me.  We blamed the pills and alcohol (they hadn't know I was on them until then.)
 However, I was babysitting tonight and started having similar thoughts, that I would lose control of myself and strangle the little girl.  I really freaked out.  At one point, she decided it would be funny to pretend to be dead (total coincidence, I hadn't said/done anything to put this in her head).  I panicked, thinking I had blacked out and killed her.  I grabbed her arm and started shouting her name, and she looked at me like I was nuts.
 I don't want to take this to my doctor because I don't want pills.  Also, I am worried that it will come up when I apply for jobs - and I want to work with children!  What is wrong with me???  What can I do??
