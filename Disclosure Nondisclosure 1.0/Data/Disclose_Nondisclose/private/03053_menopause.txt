went for routine smear test and was asked by nurse when i had my last period , well thats a strange one as i had not had one for 2 years but then but then out of the blue a big heavy one that lasted for 2 weeks ! i know this as it spoilt my holiday . oh she replied only you are bleeding a little now , funny cause ive only just finished 2 weeks ago . any case went to see lovely lady gp  ( not my usual male doctor ) who gave my an internal examination and i had some blood tests , swobs  ect then i had to wait for the results .when the results came the lady doctor that seen me was away so my usual doctor called to say that my bloods showed i was fine apart from i had a b12 defficenciey and needed to have b12  injections every six weeks for the rest of my life ! the he went on to say that the gp that has sent me to see the gynocoligists was just being too over cursious in his opion , sorry to go on so confussed and upset is he right should be going to gynocoligists ? its tommorow any advice welcome but please be nice im a little sensitive rigt now x
