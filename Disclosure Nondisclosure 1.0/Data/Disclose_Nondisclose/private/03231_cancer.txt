About five weeks ago, I fasted for 15 hours (from 2am to 7:15pm) ...Then I ate something small. After a while around 10, I ate something then after around two hours, I had this strange sensation. I was sitting and for a few seconds i felt like i was going to faint. I didn't feel weak or something, i just felt my surrounding has become a little dark then after few seconds the sensation was gone. I didn't lose any of my senses. Things weren't spinning around or anything. Nor did I lose my ability to speak. This made me so worried. I went to the doctor, he told me nothing to worry about as a drop in blood sugar can happen in such cases. 
I did the biggest mistake of my life and I googled the symptom only to be showered with catastrophic possibilities. 
I'm 22. I had my blood checked and It was all fine. Now, im living in constant worry and anxiety that this might be a tumor. 
I don't have any headaches neither do I have a weakness or anything in my body. 
I get worried easily about my health and these days I'm in complete distress just about the idea of tumors. 
Did anyone of you had something similar?  what might that be?
The net is full of health information and I'm not able to sort out what they mean by lightheadedness or dizziness when they talk about serious health problems.
