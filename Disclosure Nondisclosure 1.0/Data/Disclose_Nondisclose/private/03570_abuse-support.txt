Hi there.  Am new to this, but found this site while looking up some info, 'cause I had great concerns for my neice-she just borrowed some clonopine from me while I was out of town. She herself takes zanax but ran out.  Her Dad's a Dr.
and he was also out of town. Anyway, I trust her completely, so said, "sure..I'll get it when I come back.  When I went 
to get it, she ended up admitting to me that 1) zanax is stronger, so she had to take more... and 2) because of her body weight, she had to take even moooore!  She admitted to me that she took 8!!!!
My first response was, "oh", figuring I'm not a Dr. so I don't really know doses.  After thinking more logically about this,
I thought, "What the hell, what if she could have killed herself!!!" Obviously somethin's up here.  Can anyone help me.
I just wrote to her telling her of my concern.  She wrote back begging me not to tell her folks and apologized for even asking.  She said this is "being dealt with"...I have nooo idea if this means she has been abusing, or is addicted.  Heeeelp! Thank you so much, in advance!  :-) PS, she doesn't drink at least
