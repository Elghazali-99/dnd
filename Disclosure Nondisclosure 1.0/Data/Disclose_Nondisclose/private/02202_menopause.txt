I am a 32yr old mother that had a hysterectomy 8 months ago.  I am happily married and blessed with a 4yr old son.  At this point in time I am suffering from so many menopause symptoms and I'm not on any treatments.  I can't sleep, very rarely do I eat, the hot flushes are driving me crazy, my sore tender breasts are filled with cysts that flare up each month, and all this physical stuff has now taken a toll on my mental health.  I'm an emotional wreck!
I'm struggling to take care of my son each day, let alone myself.  Neither my mum or mother inlaw understand what I am going through as they have not reached menopause.
I live in a remote area where there is little help. Each doctor I see feel sorry for me, and label me in the 'to hard basket'.  Most drugs that I try make me ten times sicker. Just last week I had a psychologist tell me that I am the worst thing in my son's life.  Things were already bad enough, but after being told this I now feel worthless.
I am seeking any advice or support from people who actually understand what I am going through.
