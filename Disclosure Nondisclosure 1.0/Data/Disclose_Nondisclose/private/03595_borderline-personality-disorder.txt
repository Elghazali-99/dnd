I have had Borderline Personality Disorder for a few years and every time I go to the doctor or the psychiatrist I lie and say that I'm fine. I've been doing this from the beginning and now I feel like if I try to tell them the truth they will think I'm exaggerating or lying. I flip out every now and again where I get so scared I don't eat or sleep at all for days and I never go to a medical professional when this happens, I always am too scared of them, so my boyfriend deals with it all. 
He finds it hard to cope with alone but I'm scared that nobody will take me seriously, and whenever I try and talk I feel pathetic and too embarrassed. The slightest things upset me to a massive degree and I'm ashamed. I can see the way I feel doesn't make sense but it still happens. I never know what's truth and what's not in my head because I'm always warring with myself.
I don't know what to do. I just keep going in circles and making things worse, I automatically lie to everyone! What do I do?
