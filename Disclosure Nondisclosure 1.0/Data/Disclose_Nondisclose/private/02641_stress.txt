I am a 17 year old girl with no history of any heart problems.
two weeks ago on tuesday I had my mom call 911 because I felt shortness of breath and my heart started beating very fast.
So I went to the emergency room and they did all kinds of tests such as an ekg, they tested my thyroid, a brain scan, and they did many blood tests and all of it came back fine with no signs of any problems. Also my blood pressure was 120/80, my pulse was fine, and breathing was really good they said.
They told me that I had an anxiety attack and I have had a history of anxiety for almost 3 years untreated but never had an anxiety attack before, only felt anxiety in certain situations.
I have been under alot of stress lately due to my mom just having surgery and us in the process of moving.
And ever since i went to the emergency room ive been feeling like chest tightness and tingling and it runs into my left arm along with alittle pressure it feels on my throat.
Also sometimes my left arm feels achey.
I went to have a follow up a week ago and the doctor said my left shoulder was very tense and she said its my back shoulder muscle that is giving me the trouble and she put me on 500mg naproxin. I asked her if she thought it had anything to do with my heart and she said it didnt because it would have came up on my ekg and she said im too young. I also told her I had anxiety but she said i needed to talk to a different doctor about that.
I am over weight but every check up i have im always healthy.
ive just been extremely on edge lately thinking something is going to happen to me or they missed something or im dying because of the tightness and the feeling in my arm. It also isnt constant it comes and goes.
i don't know how to relax and i was wondering if you think it is anxiety or if its something more serious.
I just need all the opinions i can get to calm down. i hate feeling this way.
well if anyone could help i would be so greatful.
thank you
