Hello all - I haven't posted yet to this forum, so I'm a first-timer.
 I am a gay female and have been with my partner for 11 1/2 years.  When we got together, her son was almost 4, and we have since had a little girl together.  I have always felt that the relationship my partner has with our son is unusually affectionate and doting, and I have, for the most part, risen above this over the years.  He is now 15, and he, quite frankly, just annoys me to death.  He is frequently in "our business", talks incessantly, is constantly hugging on his mother, etc, and I am really having trouble with all of that all of a sudden.  I have never wanted to interfere with her loving her son - that has never been my intention, but this is getting on my nerves and I don't know what to do.  Last night I went up to bed and he was laying in our bed next to her.  Granted, he wasn't going to sleep with us or anything like that, but it just went all over me.  My partner could tell, and once she got him in bed she came back and expressed her dissatisfaction with what had just happened, even though I hadn't said anything about it when I arrived in the bedroom (I guess my body language was enough?).  We began to argue and I expressed some need for boundaries.  I just don't think it's necessary or healthy, for that matter, for a 15 year old boy to be snuggling with his mother in our bed.  There are other places for that kind of activity - I just don't want to see it happening in our bed.  Anyway, the argument escalated, she basically threatened to leave if my "behavior" keeps up, and I now feel absolutely awful about what happened.  
 Am I being too ridiculous in this matter?  Do I need to let it go?  Our relationship is awesome otherwise.
 Thank you!
