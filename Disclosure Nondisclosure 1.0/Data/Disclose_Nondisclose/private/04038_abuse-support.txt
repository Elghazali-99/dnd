I am 24 yrs old and the baby of the family. My mother for the past 5 years has only given me one compliment you have good grades. She is always helping my brothers and dotes on them. im not fat but im not skinny and my mother is a fanatic about apearences. ive lost 20lbs and all she can say is "thats it?" i love my mom but i havent been the perfect daughter to her all my life and what child is? im tired of being called fat, lazy, ugly and other nasty names by her. im a full time student and i have a full time job so i know im not lazy. I'm just very upset because last weekend she and I got into a tiff and i wanted to leave and then she grabbed me by the arm and hair tried to slap me across my face but i grabbed her arm to stop it. i told her she has no right to place a finger on me when i haven't been living there for 4 years nor am i financially supported by her. later that night i recieved an e-mail saying "here's to you kid, have a great life." why is she so cruel with me and not my brothers? And how can i make this stop?
