I need honesty.
I feel as though my life is a wreck, like my future isn't worth fighting for.
I've had depression, when I was 14 through till now 17. I have tried all the methods people have offered, ice cubes elastic bands talking to someone... they helped but I still wanted a tiny bit of me to suffer.
My family, Dad and my brother, are always disappointed by me they don't say it but neither do they deny it. 
I failed at school, haven't got a job, just basically being the failure of the family.
My Dad says i have a chip on my shoulder against my brother as he is the in my words 'The Golden Child' he cannot do anything wrong but when i do something no matter what it'd be, i'll get shouted at, cursed, blamed and I can never win the discussion and i accept that because truly it is my fault 55% of the time but when that 45% that isn't me i feel like jumping of the tallest build in stoke but then no one would be able to fight and stand up for me.
I don't really socialize (drink) but when i do i get even more depressed and start telling my friends everything.
I don't know what, where or how to be and even if I'm meant to be here still.
