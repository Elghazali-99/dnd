hi,
i have pretty turbulent relationships in general. now, though... i have not ever had one boyfriend who did not regret leaving me in a really bad way for years. it's almost at the point that sometimes i am afraid of starting a relationship because of my own pain, but i'm also afraid for them. my first boyfriend---abusive, and he left me. after a year he tried to find me again and i absolutely refused. he didn't date again for about 5 years convinced there was no one like me, that he could never love again and had to change his life. the next-- we dated a couple years, he kind of lied and cheated, we broke up. four years later and he still misses me and it was so hard for him i felt so awful, even years later he'd cry and was so desperate. and another i only dated 3 months, he broke up with me, now years later he always claims that he is completely in love. often too i have male friends and they fall in love with me and then can no longer be my friend because it's too painful. it's like this, and i wonder--is there something about people with borderline personality disorder that other people feel like they need? is this common, and is this about the disorder? i wonder what i've done, and if i am doing something bad. i really loved these people, but i feel sorry that they ever got involved with me in the first place. and maybe i'm lying somehow or being deceptive somehow. because i am not that great and i am needy and stuff. does this sound familiar? i hate to ask because i sound like such a jerk, but please only serious answers because i spend a lot of my time feeling really sad that the people i loved end up so sad in the end. this is stupid but i want to see if anyone can relate.
