Well I've been watching my life unravel so I've been doing some reflecting on past events. As a child of divorced parents (parents divorced when I was 8), I was raised by my mother who questioned my sexuality on several occasions throughout my life. I'm 100% heterosexual, but living with two dominant controlling women (mother/sister), I'll admit I'm a little bit soft. Mainly because any show of masculinity was usually met with some sort of confrontation. The question I have is this, my mother would take me on drives through the red light district of our town on many occasions. She would tell my things like, "oh look at that one", or "oooh, check her out, ect, things along those lines, so on and so on. I come from an addictive background, my father did coke & alcohol,plus he was a notorious womanizer. My mother may be a closet alcoholic, but I never touched drugs or alcohol in my life in order not to to turn out like them. The thing that got me was sex, she did this when I was about 11/12, so me & my best friend went back on our own of course, armed with condoms & money we stole out of our mothers purses picking up prostitutes. This was hard to do at first because of our age, but there were some girls that were 14, 15, ect that were runaway types who finally obliged. This was the start of an addiction that has lasted and I'm wondering if this constitutes abuse, or just bad judgement. She never paid, or hired a prostitute for me or anything, but she made the impression on me.
 Thanks in advance
