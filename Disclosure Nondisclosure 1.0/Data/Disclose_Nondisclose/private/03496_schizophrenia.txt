Hi i'm Terrance & I have a girlfriend Sarah we live in london. I need to know if she has psychosis? I would ask a doctor but we have to wait a week in advance. Anyway this is whats happening.
 My girlfriend we've been together for a month now. She told me she feels like the whole intire world is going to turn into Zombies she says she wants to prepare for when it does she says she don't know when but she's absalutley determind it's going to be really soon.
 & before you ask has she been playing or watching Zombie movies or games & the answer is no, she is also dreaming about them sometimes she'd be to scared to sleep she always has nightmares every night. I walk in she  jumps up very very quickly I walked in at one point & she had a knife in her hand along with an ash tray. 
 her moods change very frequently.. She seems to panic more at night about the Zombies locks the front & the back doors top to bottom. & another thing the other night she had her back to the t.v because I was straightening her hair she says she always feels like something or someones going to come out of the t.v to hurt or grab her. 
 Her sleep is so deprived she has to stay up 2-3 nights just so she can sleep the following night sometimes she sleeps to much like 12 hours the most. She used to self harm but no longer she thinks about it at times but she always says 'i'm not going to do something permenantly stupid while i'm temporarily upset' shes smart really smart.
 If you're wondering.. she doesn't smoke we're both non smokers. & totally against drugs. She sometimes thinks people are up to something. She thinks people are watching her on a t.v & sometimes talks to her self & no one is there trust me no ones there she admitted that trufily she confessed all this last night because I asked her to, she trusts me I have to get answers pronto. 
 If you can kindly tell me what might be going on i'd very much appreciate it alot! Thanks man It means the world right now...
