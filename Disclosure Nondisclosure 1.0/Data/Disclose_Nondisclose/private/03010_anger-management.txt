hello!
i do not know from where to start but let's say that i am usually an agry person or i would get angry really fast.
for the past year i've been dealing with alot first am a university student in a very tough program away from my family, second my sister is getting an ugly divorce, third i was deeply heartbroken by some guy. i got really depressed during the last year as i had couple accidents due to lack of concentration but nothing happened to me but my car was slightly hurt. so i eventually started myself on antidepressants and few months later i stopped them cause i did not want to be dependent on anything.
 now am in my summer break and am staying with my family, am still heartbroken and my sis is soon to end her divorce papers and she has a baby now which sometimes annoys me with her crying.
 i feel frustrated and angry all the time, lost all my religious beliefs and stopped talking to my friends. i keep on swearing fighting and being aggressive with everyone.i am totally lost and i do not know what am supposed to do. i can't listen to any problems/ negativity/ or slightest comment..it all affects me deeply
