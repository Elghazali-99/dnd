Long story short I have recently separated from my husband due to his chronic alcoholism.   I am now faced with raising our two sons on my own, he has no job, I am now filing for bankruptcy, probably going to lose our home, and I myself have along list of medical issues.  My problem is that because of all this stress I have lost approximately 25 pounds since November, some due to the meds that I take, but mostly because I can not seem to make myself eat.  When I try to eat I either get nauseated or I end up with diarrhea for three hours after I eat even the smallest thing.  Needless to say I am starving and would like to be able to eat a normal meal without having any of these things happen.  I am NOT deliberately not eating, I desperately want to eat but my body just won't seem to let me.  I have seen my doctor about this and he is concerned and has prescribed an antidepressant in hopes that this will help, that was two weeks ago.  He prescribed this because too many other drugs interfere with the other meds that I have to take.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated before I end up in the hospital and leave my two boys without a mommy or a daddy.
