People like me don't even belong on mental health sites.  People like me are too bored with life.  People like are like ghosts that i don't know how to be in the living.
 I am fighting urges to go into a rage.  
 I am not trying to put on a show for anyone but I am sick and tired of misunderstood.  I don't crave attention for the sake of it.
 I am just trying to find a way to feel comfortable with myself.  I just hadn't figured out how and the scary thing is that i don't think i will feel comfortable.
 Yeah, maybe I don't appreciate my life enough.  I just want it to end.  I don't want to be nusiance to anyone.
 I wish that there someway that I could feel as if I truly belonged in this world. 
 I don't want to disturb anyone with my misery.  I want to not exist.  I wasn't meant for anything good.
 People said i was no good and yes I believe them because I got nothing going for me.
 All i have are desires that are unfulfilled.  
 Why do i keep having these pain, loneliness.  I just want to end.  I am sorry but I can't stand myself.
 Everything i write, I am going to want to erase it.  I just want to cease to exist.  
 There's nothing good in this world for me.  I am sorry I signed up.  Maybe I might think i should have thought about before i did it.
