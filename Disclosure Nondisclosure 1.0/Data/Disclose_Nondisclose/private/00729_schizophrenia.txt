My step daughter has been having some bizarre episodes lately.  She has a recent history of paranoia in that she feels that there is a conspiracy against her, including her spouse and myself and my husband.  She feels everyone is out to "get her".  She also says she hears voices in her home and when she goes to check on her husband in another room to see if he is talking to her, he may, in fact, be sleeping, and she still thinks he is talking to her.  She thinks he may be in the other room on the phone with a "girl friend".  She is always suspicious of him and constantly checking his cell phone and email to see if he is having an affair.  She has two young daughters, 1 year and 2 years and she says she is worried to leave them with anyone, even family, for fear they will sexually violate them in some way or hurt them.  She also recently had two episodes, a few weeks apart, where she was cleaning and all of a sudden thought her finger was broken and the pain was intense.  20 minutes later, she looked at her finger, and there was nothing there.  She said it had even looked twisted to her.  When this happened the second time, and while she was having the pain in her finger, she took a picture of her finger so she could look at it later.  She showed me the picture and the finger is absolutely fine but she said, at the time, the pain was intense and it looked twisted and broken.  If anyone has any comments for me, please help.  I'm worried for her and my granddaughters.  Could this be early paranoid schizophrenia?  Thanks to all of you out there and for anyone suffering from this awful, debilitating disease.
