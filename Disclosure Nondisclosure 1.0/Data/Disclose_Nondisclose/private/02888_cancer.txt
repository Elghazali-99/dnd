My Dad diagnosed to have a prostate cancer (stage 2). He just got a  Perineal prostatectomy and recovery seems ok. Before he had the surgery, he had a PET scan. But the result looks a bit weird. The report indicates some low positive value at the neck and shoulder. He has another MRI but there is not indication of cancer spreading.
The readings of ACT Standard SUVmax are 1.9 and 2.4
 He may go for a series of radiation therapy and visited 2 specialists.
One of the specialists are not sure why these 2 numbers though he think that it may be caused by the equipment being too sensitive. He required my father to go for another round of testing before he receive the radiation therapy
 The other specialist thinks that this is impossible that the cancer spreaded to other area but there is no indication of cancer cell in the lower body. The specialist concluded that the value below 2 is very likely to be caused by the machine.
 Can anyone explain what is that SUVmax ? What is a good golden benchmark for a positive indicator ?
