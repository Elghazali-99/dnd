I have been taking effexor 37.5 for 6 weeks now,and besides the funny feeling i had the first week I'm feeling much better. My anxiety and stress have subsided and i feel calm. I am very concerned with my recent gambling habits and asked my doctor if it was a side effect of the medication. She told me i am just making poor decisions and it is not due to the meds. I took her word for it and said to myself that it is a decision and decided i would no longer gamble. But I'm scared because i keep doing it. My entire paycheck and now using my line of credit! This has been going on for 3 Weeks. In the past i would view a visit to the casino as pure entertainment and might go once or twice a year. I never spent more than 50 or 60 at a time. But recently i have been leaving work on my lunch break and blowing through 400 or more a day. This has to stop! I've never had a problem with gambling before. I know i can't afford this and it's going to ruin me, my rational mind says stop, but it keeps happening and i can't get a handle on it.
