I took an overdose last week and was basically told if i did it again my therapsit would discharge so he has given up he said maybe i need to take a break from therapy if it wasn't working, but the thing is he doesn't actually do any therapy because he doesn't know what to do, he is annoyed because when i od'ed i had to go to my gp and she called and emergency cpn and they blamed my therapist and said he wasn't doing enough to help me because if he was i wouldn't have done that. They are trying to change me into another treatment team as my psychiatrist is moving to recovery care and i am in primary care basically with recovery i would get better care but the psychiatrist who is over it said BPD isn't a mental illness so could be not seeing my social worker if it all changes over. It seems when i need them the most they are leaving me they said they are trying to help but they don't know what to do and i am scared they are all leaving. The plan is now if they meet the BPD specialist she will decide how is that fair she has never met me she is meeting my therapist. So spent all last week suicidal and they rejected me pushed me away and threatned me i feel so hurt and let down by them i had to commit to not to self-harm or they will put me in hospital against my will how crap is that? I feel they are messing with me they don't really care so if i decide ot od again i won't be telling them, just reached apoint where i am so confused and depressed and there is no hope.
