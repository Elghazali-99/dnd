Hello I am not over weight, i am nearly 50 and a woman
last year in particular i began to hate my arms,, noticed that they were kind of skinny, ,had no fill to them, that at the elbows there were kind of hollows at certain angles it looked awful, kind of not enough meat in there? and wrinkles excess skin like it needed some more fat in there
and then at the top of my inner arms the same, like excess wrinkle skin, like it had lost the fat? 
 presume getting older? but why do you arms go like this
 also this year notice that my veins in my arms especially in the creases are so pronouced they look awful.  why is this, i hate it?
 is there something wrong with me?
 i have recently started to take a very good multi vit tablet and omega 3 6 & 9 to see if i can stop getting too old
my hair is good, my nails have ridges on for years  
 I have had underactive thryoid for 10 years but under control
I take telfast and cimidine
 lately i feel light headed a lot dont know why
 my WBCs have been down and glands up but they seem to be getting better
 but really worried about looking old, arms are looking old, they are far to thin the dip in the creases of the elbows so they look hollow at certain angles, often catcch myself looking at them and thinking yuck they dip in how awful they look, the skin is in excess there when dipped in and wrinkles looks so old, and the veins stick out sometimes in the crease and then like is said the skin in the inside of my upper arms are the same.
 also have excess skin on my upper inside legs
 my skin seems to look old, its not so firm now, excess and wrinkles what can i do about it? to stop it to improve it
 frightened to lift a few weight incase it makes my veins stand out more and dont want this
 or is it a medical condition that is affecting my skin and veins?
 thanks for any help
