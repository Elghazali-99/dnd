Hello. I would like to understand why my sibling feels she was abused by the rest of the family. We have all been loving and have helped her in the best way we could, ran all her errands, did all the wedding arrangements, helped her during her divorce, helped her in her business, looked after her home when she was not in the country, looked after her pet and the list goes on. 
But because we did not travel to be with her during her divorce ( we were on the email and phone everyday, helped financially and even found friends in the city where she lived to take care of her), she holds it against us.
She complains that when she visits us, we dont show her a good time, or plan a dinner in her honor ( we would take her out for dinner, as I am tired at the end of a long day and as i do not entertain, going out is a stress reliever and also while she is visiting, she will complain and fight, that plans eventually are cancelled)
She says we never sent her cards on significant occasions ( I would always email to wish or call. I do not plan in advance to buy cards and post it, and do not expect anyone to do so for me)
All this she says is emotional abuse. 
Am I in the wrong?
 Any advise is truly appreciated. Thank you
