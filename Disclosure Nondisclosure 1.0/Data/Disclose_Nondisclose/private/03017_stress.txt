Hi there, 
 So in the past I have had many failed relationships; or rather relationships that did not last the test of time (but i recieved growth and good memories nonetheless) and recently I was rejected by 2 possible soulmates, Andrew and Steven. 
 Andrew was a sex addict who belittled me for not being loose, and Steven I was not sexually attracted to so he became extremly volatile and emotianally abusive. 
 Now I am over these both past relationships, but whenever I find myself being happy in career growth, personal growth, etc. I find my relatives (namely, my Dad's older sister who lives with us) picking on me, saying things like "what happened to Andrew? what happened to Steven? made a fool out of you and ran away? your life *****? don't you dare try to move forward, who you are today is who you will be forever". etc. 
 how do i get over this? i am over both relationships; the fact that those 2 men are no longer in my life is nothing but a blessing, but whenever i find myself moving better and going towards the direction of finding someone new...i hear their evil taunts in my mind. i am also so fearful of getting in another serious relationship and growing, being happy and moving forward as I am nervous that if it doesnt work out i will further be taunted and harassed. 
 help...what should i do? 
thanks
