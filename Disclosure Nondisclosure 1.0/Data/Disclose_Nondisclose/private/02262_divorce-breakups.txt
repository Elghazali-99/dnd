Well it has been over a year since my husband of 30 years gave me the I love you but not in love with you talk, he left his family and marriage for a 22year old friend of our daughter and I must say it ripped our family apart. My son was doing his year 12 finals, but he didn't care he left....I had to move my family away from our town.  Now a year on, my daughter is still in counseling and she is expecting my first grandchild with her partner.  So I am very happy about that, and my son has had the worse year and refused counseling, but through lots of love he has come out the other end and he is now talking about his future. Well then there is me, it has been the worse year of my life and I have had some bad ones, but I went to counseling and still am which has done a lot for me.  I have tried dating, but still not ready yet, but I have saved up every penny I had and I have bought us a little tiny home, but it is ours and the kids and I are very proud of us....I have become very strong and I must say I am starting to make a lot of plans for the future, and I am looking forward to being alone for a while....never thought I would say that.....I am studying Law now and love it, who knows what the future holds, but all I know it is my future with my wonderful and beautiful children, who have stuck by me the whole time.  Oh, yes and him, well the girl left when she realized I made the money not him, now he is alone and living in a run down farm house, and the only friends he has is 2, 65 year old people, so much for having fun and enjoying life...grass wasn't greener on the other side (surprise) well now he wants us to date and see if he can fall in love with me again....and he is starting to build a relationship with the kids, this makes my son happy but my daughter is less forgiving, it will take time....and me well there is no future for us, the more I see him, the stronger I become and the weaker he looks.  I words I said to myself were, believe, hope and strength and I repeated them anytime I was down. They got me through the year, I covered my tattoo with his name and now it is time for a divorce, and my future can begin....thank you to everyone who gave me strength in my time of need....Love Elvy (Linda)
