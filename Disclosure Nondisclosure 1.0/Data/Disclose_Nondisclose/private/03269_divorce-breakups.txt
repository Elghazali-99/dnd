My husband has been gone since August 9th. I had sent him a message on FB about three weeks after that telling him that I was sorry that things had gotten to this point and I will love him always. I just wanted to have some closure even though I was the one who filed for the divorce. I really didnt want the divorce but we fought over my kids and his daughter all the time and it just got really bad!  I have cried and felt so down that I dont want to do anything!  We had actually been texting or calling every now and then but his ex wife told me that he told her on Sept 9 that he wished I would stop calling him and begging him to come home!  I did not say that! I told him my feelings I did not ask him to come home. I cant believe he said that to his ex wife!!  i guess its true though because I know I did call him on Sept 11 and he had a different tone in his voice I felt like I was bothering him so I have not contacted him at all since and I have not heard from him either. Its  just so hard when you love someone so much but if he cant respect my kids  then its not working.  this is the most difficult thing ive ever been through!!!  i just wish i could hate him and it would be easier.....
