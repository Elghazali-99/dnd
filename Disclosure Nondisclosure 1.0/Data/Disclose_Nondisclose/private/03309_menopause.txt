I am 50 years old, perimenopausal for more than 8 years, and have skipped several periods over the years including twice last year. The most recent interval without bleeding lasted 118 days from December 14th 2012 to April 8th 2013 (I thought I was done!), but I am now on day 27 of a period that seems never ending. 
The first 2 weeks of this period was a light flow but now the flow is moderate with the usual cramps, clotting, and swollen sore breasts. I have had lengthy periods before but never exceeding 23 days. 
I had an endometrial biopsy previously with normal results, and a normal Ca-125 test (13 U/ml). I have been on 10 mg Provera BID for the past 2 years to even out my estrogen dominance, which does make me feel better. 
Just looking for some reassurance ... should I continue to ride this out in the hopes this period will eventually stop, or should something else be done? The last time I had a very long period like this 2 years ago I did have a simple 6 cm ovarian cyst that ruptured on its own.
Thank you for any insight you may have!
