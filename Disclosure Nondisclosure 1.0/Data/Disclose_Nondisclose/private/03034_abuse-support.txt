You would never believe my situation, at 39 I'm losing everything, my house, my credit, my marriage.  I had to get away from my husband because he was always addicted to something and never made enough money.  I have 2 boys and have always had that white picket fence and made all the money to hold it all together.  I might be going through mid-life crisis, but 1 year ago I met a 26 year old who was smart and I thought he would rescue me from my life, now after 1 year he's starting to abuse me mentally and NOW physically.  He smashed my head against his car and hit me in the face.  I have never been physically abused before, but I still find myself wanting to call him and be with him because of all the love he gave me that my spouse never gave me.  It's killing me and I feel so weak, I was always a very strong person but I have been emotionally shut down, I can't believe I have to write on the internet that's how sad I am.  I don't know who to turn to?  I feel guilty but at the same time like I have been taken for.  Please help.
