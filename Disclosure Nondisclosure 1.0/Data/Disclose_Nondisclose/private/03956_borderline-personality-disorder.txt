Hi  diemyn,
 I've been diagnosed with a BPD after a serious break up with my love (ex). The psychiatrist told me that i'm having a depression from the breakup, which was true. (We were completely in love with each other, totally, but that's another story.) I'm very fine now and over the whole thing. Anyway, meantime, the doc diagnosed me with BDP, i was quite shocked at the finding :) 
Having read about the symptoms, there are few that applies to me, but very midely, and i dont harma myself, actually quite the contrary. So i'm confused a bit whether her diagnosis was correct or not. 
 Please can you tell me from your point of view and experience what is likely to feel or maybe not...
 PS: I have a very strong 6 senth, and also I'm very sensitive. I worked on both of them to reduce them, cos they were only hurting me, and it worked, eventhough sometimes, without any effort i do see things or have insights just like that, and they turn out to be correct. 
I would like to tell everyone more about my experiences, and how i learned from them, but also I learned a lot more from my ex. 
I would appreciate an answer.
Kind regards,
Ella
PS: I'm 33
