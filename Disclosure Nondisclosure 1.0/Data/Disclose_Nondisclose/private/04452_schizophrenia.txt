Ive been on seroquel and amitriptylne for abt 6 yrs now. They suddenly stopped working so i quit them. Over the last 6 months ive tried every med out there for sleep and nothing has helped. Ive had severe insomnia since i was a child. Anyways ive tried various antipsychotics through my psychiatrist. The most recent one i tried was olanzapine. The thing is, i only took 2 doses and right away i got muscle spasms and tics through my entire body. I came off it. Its been one week and the spasms havent stopped. They happen every few seconds in my toes legs, my fingers also completely jerk and move on their own. My fingers are the worst. There are movements in my face eyes and lips too but they are minor compared to my body. I have searched google for hrs and there is so little info. What can i do to prevent it from getting worse asap. Also i may need to go back on seroquel..ive been off for 6 months but being off it is really messed me up mentally. I dont think seroquel was the culprit. I never had any spasms on it. It was the olanzapine and it took only one dose. Before that i also tried risperidone for a month so who knows.
 I need to get back on seroquel as its the only thing that helps me sleep, but now im too afraid. I hsvent slept at all after my shift tonight im laying in bed and my leg is jerking all over the place. Along with my fingers.
