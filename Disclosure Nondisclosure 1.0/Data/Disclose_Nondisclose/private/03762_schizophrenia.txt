Among all the other problems I have I am experiencing severe head stress. I have been under a lot of stress for over a year now and I have developed this thing where the veins in the sides of my temple and forehead swell and I can feel them, they are really tight, and I can see them clearly. I have them worse now then ever, on both sides of my head. This isn't new though, and they can persist for a couple days at a time, and then subside. And though they subside (seemingly go away), they really concern me because they were never here before a year ago and I am 28 now.  They go and they come back, and they are, when severe, accompanied with a headache that feels like my head is about to throb, but worse.  It's like an ongoing tension and my brain feels a lot of stress!! But it seems that this is worst after doing physical exercise. It almost seems that because I am stressing so bad mentally, with or even without physical exertion my brain undergoes very bad stress and these veins appear to prove it. Sometimes it makes me feel like my brain "clenches" and it becomes hard for me to swallow, and I feel like I am going to drop dead, literally. I know that difficulty swallowing is anxiety attack, and I am not denying that, but can anyone please help me explain the stress that my brain undergoes, please?
