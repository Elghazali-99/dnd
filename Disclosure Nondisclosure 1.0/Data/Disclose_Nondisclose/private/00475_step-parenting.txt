Hi, Just signed up to this because I am in a situation I am not coping well with and I don't have anyone in a similar situation to ask for advice from or can relate.
My girlfriend and I are both divorces, I have 2 children of my own aged 7 and 9 (both girls) who come and live with me and my girlfriend every weekend. My girlfriend of 3 years has 2 children from previous relationships aged 17 (girl) and 22(boy) who live with us full time. We bought a house together a year ago. I don't get on with her son at all where all communication has broken down completely now. He is very difficult to get along with as we think he has autism. He is a little boy trapped in a mans body although he smokes, drinks and is constantly going from girlfriend to girlfriend. He "works" for a gypsy for £30 a day cash in hand 4 days a week. He doesn't acknowledge my children at all, Doesn't get involved in any family things and does not really seem to accept the whole 2 families becoming 1 scenario.  
I Can't talk to my girlfriend as we end up rowing about him because she gets defensive just me mentioning his name. so he has become a taboo subject. As his mother I can see her wanting to support her son but I feel I don't have her support and I am lost.
I Love her and I accept she has children and I have no issues with her daughter and she is fantastic with my kids.
She wants to get married and although I want too this issue with me and her son has stopped me from proposing. she knows this which of course causes more arguments.
Any advice would be very very welcome
