I have a crazy situation in my personal life!  My fiance has a little boy who's almost 4.  He's a pretty good kid but spoiled beyond belief with NO rules!  We recently went through a stage where he was disrespecting me.  Now he's calmed down a little bit and the ex is causing problems.  The worst thing of all is that my soon to be in-laws hate me!  They're so caught up in their grandson's life that they want to be his parents and fault me for every change my fiance has made for his son.  On New Years Day, we went to pick up my fiance's son and his parents exploded on both of us, doubting the parenting my fiance does and telling me that the grandchild resents me and is feeling deprived because I'm in the picture.  My fiance's father even went so far as to tell my fiance that if it is not his legal day to have his child and the ex leaves the child with them, that my fiance has no right to get his child from them!!  I'm learning a lot about my fiance's family and the disfunction there and it's concerning me as to how we can possibly continue on with this wedding without any contact with them.  
 I'm at the end of the rope here with how much I can handle in this relationship anymore.  I find myself constantly anxious, losing sleep, and wound up non-stop because of these people!  My fiance is an absolute doll and I couldn't ask for a better guy, but I'm afraid with the amount of stress this causes me that I'm going to snap!  Please advise!
