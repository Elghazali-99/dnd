Dear Sir, I have been married from last five years and have a daughter. My husband is very arrogant and unpredictable. Sometimes he react sarcastically. I am not able to understand his nature. Even for small discussions he gets angry and start yelling at me. It really makes me upset a lot. My daughter is not staying with me she is back-home with my parents. It was his decision only to send her. Whenever I start over conversation related to his behavior he never listen to me and again start yelling. I don't know how to tell him. I really love and care for him. Once we had arguments, I asked him to meet some counselor then too he denied. I am a doctorate student and need alot of time for studies but he suddenly decide for party with his friends and when I tell him that I dont have time for such activities he don't understand. I don't know whether it is true or not but I feel he does not care about my feelings at all and always impose his decisions on me and expect me to obey whether or not it is good for me. I am really upset and do not know how to make him understand about my feelings. Please help me. Send me email if you can.
