I lied to my bf about my past. I have been in relationship with my bf for less than a year but i am madly in love with him. He knows i had a bf but what he doesn't know is that i'm not virgin. I once had sex with my ex bf but i never wanted it and was completely forced by my ex for doing it. I have regretted it ever since. My ex was a jerk he told every single person i knew that he and i had sex but no one believed it and once my current bf had asked me about it because my ex was disturbing me and when my current bf tried to stop him he heard this from one of his casual friend that this rumor is going on about me. i was so ashamed of myself because my bf is a virgin and we belong to very restricted society and i was afraid that if i tell him he ll be ashamed of me. Now i'm going into depression coz of a hormonal disorder and that lie keeps poping in my head. I don't know what to do? i know the chances of my ex meeting my current bf are nil but i can't stop thinking about it. please help me. should i tell him or keep it as a secret?
