so the past couple years have been really rough between us we have three kids the first one from a different father our first child together has pretty severe autism and we have a one year old.
 he does not help with the baby at all when i was pregnant 8 months he yelled at me how he didnt want the baby which was devastating to me cause we actually planned him 
 he has not come straight home after work in as long as i can remember cause he wants to relax when he is off of work, he does not allow me to go out with friends like the last time i went out was in october and i gave him 9 months notice for that... if i am in a bad mood he starts screaming at me calling me a stu pid piece of s h i t ... threatens to not buy me necceities.... i needed tampons a couple weeks ago and he interrogated me about it as to why i would neeed them cause he bought some 4 months ago 
 told me that if i dont sleep with him that he wont buy me things well im not a prostitute 
 when he is mad at me he takes things away from me like when i used to smoke he would take them and leave and yesterday he took my starbucks away so when i got a chance a grabbed it and threw it all over his car 
 he screams at me when i am talking in a normal voice 
 when he is mad at me he will say well im not doing this now like some thing that he promised to do for my first son
 after a few days of fighting he will be like im sorry i love you i didnt mean it but then it just starts all over again like a cycle
 how do i get out of this it is pulling me under and i cant take it much longer
