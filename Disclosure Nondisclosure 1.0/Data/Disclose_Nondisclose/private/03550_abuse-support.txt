i was just informed that a few years ago my now 18 year old daughter may have had some physical sexual contact with my now 11 year old son.At this point we do not know to the extreme of how far the sexual contact was taken,whether it was just touching and feeling or more,but he seems to be botherd by it and confused so we have taken him to a therapist.Again this has happend 2/3 years or more ago,when he was about 7 or 8,and she was 14/15,and only on 2 or 3 occasions as far as we know,so we dont know whether to blow this up or just let it pass as innocent adolecent behaviour ?We are afraid for both our children...the boy because he is showing signs of confusion and depression over the incident....and the daughter because we are afraid if we confront her with what we know she may panic and try to commit suicide or something ?We are at the mercy of your staff ? How should we handle this ? The abuse alledgedly took place again 2/3 years ago and not since so should we just let it slide ?? Please help ? Thank you ! Michael.
