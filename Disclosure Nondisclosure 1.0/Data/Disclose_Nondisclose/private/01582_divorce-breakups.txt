My husband is 34 years old.  I recently posted a little background on what I have been going through with him.  We are in the process of finalizing our divorce.  We have been separated for almost a year and it is during this time that he cut off our children for good (will not call or visit them!),  lives between his parents home and mistress's place,  and he recently purchased a very expensive 2013 sportscar that ranges between $30-$35G's!  How he got the money remains a mystery because he has very bad credit due to outstanding debts (unpaid loans, maxed credit cards,  expensive legal fees,  etc).  In fact,  he has been going on shopping sprees and spending money like he has some!
 He dresses different, acts different, styles his hair very different,  claimed that he was "too young and good looking" to be a husband and father anymore,  rides around in a flashy car...
 Um,  could this be an early mid-life crisis?
 I mentioned in my previous post that he may be bipolar.  Are these signs of bipolarism?
