My husband and I have been seperated for 3 months now. He moved back in with his parents and we said we were through. Both of us said it. And this is not our first split up. Well about a month and a half ago I went out with some friends and went dancing. One of his friends seen me and told him about it and now he has accused me of moving on. But yet since the incident we have slept together many times. About a month ago during one of those nights he held me and I realized I miss him. So i have spent the past month trying to reconcile. He says I ruined the marrige and I only want him back cause the grass was not greener on the other side. Whoch is not what happened. But when I as for the divorce he wants he tells me to do it since I want it. He will not proceed with it. Im lost. he does not want to come home. He does not want to be with me. And yet he will not file divorce. He wants me too but I want us to work it out..... What do I do now. I dont want to go into 2011 like this... Please advice from anyone would be great!
