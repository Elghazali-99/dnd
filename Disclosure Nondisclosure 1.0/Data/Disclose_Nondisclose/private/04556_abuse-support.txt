Hi im a 19 year old female racked with intense guilt so much so that i dont know how to deal anymore. When i was a kid around 9 - i really can't remember that much- my mom's friend would bring over his 6 year old daughter. We'd do normal girl stuff  like play dolls or supermodel in my room. But sometimes she'd want to play mom and dad . We'd grind on each other from behind fully clothed and it occured a couple of  times. Back then i didnt think anything of it we were kids playing the fool. But the older i got the more disgusted i got with my self after all she was a kid and i should have been more responsible.... i should have stopped it ....... I hate myself. Now were grown we like totally avoid each other, she's even hostile. She hasnt been as fortunate as me, her mom is now a drug addict, her fathers a drunk and her aunt just died of cancer.  To think i could have added to her troubles by psychologically damaging her......  I think i should also mention that there was another time a friend and i were playing pillow fight and we got into some weird positions - we stopped immediately but it made me feel icky due to my previous experience. 
 Honestly i can't believe i could have done this stuff;  i could never harm another human being or a child for that matter, i even look forward to being a great mom someday. So i m asking am i overreacting or am i a molester and how do i deal?
