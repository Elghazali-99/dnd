Hey everyone... I just kinda need to get a buncha **** out of my system. And please don't just tell me to "stop" or "seek treatment" because I've done it all.
 I 15 and am in a really strong relationship with the boy of my dreams. We've been together for just over a year, and when we started dating we promised each other that we'd quit our vices (mine: cutting and drinking; his: drinking and weed.) and i was ok for most of the time. but two months ago i got into another fight with my father, during which he grabbed me by the neck and pushed me against the wall, the most violent he has been yet. Afterwards, I lost my head (I am just getting Prozac out of my system, and my depression is coming back with a vengeance) and i went up and massacred the hell out of my arms and legs.
 An hour later, it hit me: I'm going to have to tell him. and i knew that he would tell my mom ( who would send me to a local treatment center, but last time i was there, i left worse than i arrived.) and that would not be good for me. My boyfriend wouldn't leave me; he would instead help me get better. It's just horrible to lie to him over and over...
 And something else hit me: i had crashed. After almost a year of being clean following 3 years of cutting and 4 suicide attempts, I had relapsed... and i have nothing to be depressed about...god i'm nothing.
 Does anyone have any new methods of coping?
 I have:
-Been on meds
-Gone to In and Outpatient treatment
-Listened to music
-Drawn/painted
-Watched tv
-Talked to people
-Tried drinking (im straight-edge now.)
 Please help me. I cant handle this right now...finals are this week....
