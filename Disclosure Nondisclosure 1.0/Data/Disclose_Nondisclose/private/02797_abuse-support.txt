I have several instances but will only state one at this time why I believe my 2-year-old grandson is being emotionally (and perhaps physically abused) by his daddy (my S-I-L)... I call it as I see it... my SIL is a big bully, he bullies my daughter (his wife) and has begun playing head games with my g-son.  As recent as yesterday I took my grandson home after him spending the night with me..  My SIL was outside and working in the yard... he turned to my grandson when I got him out of the car and told him in a very loud voice "Come here right now!  There was immediate fear on my g-son's face and his dad kept insisting he come to him over and over again raising his voice louder each time.  My g-son at that time rooted his feet firmly to the ground and wouldn't move.. .My SIL at that time said "Don't make me get mean with you, you know what it's like when I get mean!"  And my g-son ducked his head and started little by little inching towards him... My SIL said "one step at a time but come! Don't make me come and get you!"  My g-son was almost there and my SIL said "Okay so Daddy wants a hug, that's all you have to do is listen to me, was that so bad?  Next time listen and we won't have to go through this!"  This is just one example and there are many more where I believe some physical abuse has taken place also... BTW my daughter just stood where she was and watched the whole thing transpire as she is very frightened of her husband also... Please help me to know what the fine line between abuse and just being a BIG BULLY is.... I don't want to stand by and allow things to get worse if I should be more proactive.
