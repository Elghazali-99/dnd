After a 4 year relationship resulting in my 6 year old a 3.5 year relationship resulting in my 3 year old I am now 7 weeks pregnant. The bd and I dated for a year now and were going through some things when I found out I was pregnant while on the pill. I never wanted anymore children and he did because his son died at 10 months old. He actually wanted a baby with me and I said I didn't want anymore kids. Well I ended up pregnant. I told him and he told me to have an abortion that with everything we're going through and I'm going through a baby is not good. I chose not to...we hardly talk but once in a while he'll tell me he loves me and misses me. Things were great between us. I'm very confused and wondering if he'll ever come around because as of now we are broken up and I don't think he believes I'm really pregnant. Just looking for some support and advice. It's been really hard getting out of bed or being excited or even taking care of my other two children knowing I'm going though this alone...
