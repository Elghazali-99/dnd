I'll be the first to admit it, my life *****. I have no friends, there are days when I go completely without human interaction. I lost my father when I was nine, my mother is addicted to drugs, half of my aunts are "Jesus Freaks," and hate me because I have a tattoo, the other half are addicted to pills. I've been molested six times. I weigh almost 300lbs. I am way to obsessed with a superstar, who I see and talk to almost everyday, and yes I know he is just in my intimation. I've been in poverty pretty much all my life, lived in a tent, in our broken down car more than once. Sometimes we've lived with complete strangers. Hince, some of the molestation. 
 I live in college, and I am lone even surrounded by people. My roommate hates me for ever move I make and I try to appease her, but it never works.  
 And with all this I can live. 
 But I still want to die. I feel like I'm fighting something inside of me and the only way to stop fighting it is to die. I have about fourteen aspirin in  my dresser drawer. I've been thinking about them for about the last six days. I keep putting it off, and keep putting it off. I don't know how much longer I can do it any more. I honestly don't understand why I feel this way. I feel like I should be over all of the things I've listed above, it's in the past and I can't change them, and I don't feel like they are the things I'm fighting. I have short burst where I'm estaticly happy, then I sink down into depression worse than before. How can I stop this? How can I make it end with out killing myself? Or is death the only way?
