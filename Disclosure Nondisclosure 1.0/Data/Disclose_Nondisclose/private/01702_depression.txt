I have been on antidepressants for the past 5 years. For the past 10 months I have had gynelogical problems and the gynecologist wanted me to take another type of antidepressant for the pain and to see my doctor for a script. Just over a week ago I went to the doctors but could not see my doctor as she was booked out for over a week. The doctor I seen took me off the antidepressants was on and started me on another one 2 days later. I had an emergency appointment with my doctor this Monday just been as I have had no sleep and feeling really anxious, irritable, and tired all the time. my doctor said it was a combination suddenly stopping the antidepressants and side effects I got from the cymbalta the new antidepressant I was put on. I am now on Temaze sleeping tablets and started on a new antidepressant Allegron . Does anyone know how long these terrible withdrawals from stopping antidepressants suddenly will last for and if anyone has suggestions on how to help get me through this ordeal it is such a nightmare.
