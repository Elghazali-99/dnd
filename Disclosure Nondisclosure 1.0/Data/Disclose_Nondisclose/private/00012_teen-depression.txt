I'm 17 years old and have lately felt as if I'm in a deep dark pit and whenever I try to get out something is just pushing me back in. I started to worry about this feeling so I told my mom, she told me i'm probably depressed so I told her to take me to someone to talk to, but she never did. Maybe she just forgot! I'm  popular and have many friends and hang out most of the time with my brother who is 19 years old, but I do homeschooling and my mom thinks that i'm lonely and that is why I may be depressed. I'm not lonely and knows that this is not my problem. I feel very emotional and cry myself to sleep most of the time for no reason. I'm angry all the time and don't feel like laughing. when I exercise I feel bit better but only for an hour or two. my sleeping pattern and eating habits is messed up. I'm also a diabetic and knows being emotional is not good for my bloodsugar levels, but besides that my bloodsugar levels is 99% of the time normal.
 I really don't know what to do anymore and i don't feel like talking about to my mom anymore...any advise what i could do??
