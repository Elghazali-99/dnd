Hi, I am 40 and I had a complete hysterectomy on October 26th due to a complex cyst that turned out being benign, it was an endometrioma. Everything was taken out, ovaries, uterus, fall tubes, cervix, and a vaginal cuff is what was created and exists. 
 I started having hot flashes and night sweats about one week into the forced surgical menopause. I have noticed thinner skin as well but that even took place before the hysterectomy, it seems like it's increasing a bit now. 
 One weird symptom I just noticed is increase in bruising. I had two red spots on my left upper arm and then a bruise developed yesterday as well. Not a huge one and you can tell it's already trying to heal too but I definitely have increase bruising right now.
 Is that also a symptom of menopause and if so, why is it? I have read at other places it is but I don't understand why and what I can do to help this symptom? I do know given that I had forced surgical menopause, the symptoms of menopause are even worse since they are so immediate, is this true?
 One week post op, so five weeks ago, I was a little concerned over the spotting and wanted to make sure it was in the norm, the doctor even ran, a CBC, metabolic panel, INR, and another clotting test, everything was perfectly normal. I assume things couldn't change in five weeks time to cause something serious that would cause bruising so I wanted to mention the bloodwork.  
 But yes, is bruising a symptom of menopause? Other symptoms I'm having are: night sweats, hot flashes, heart pounds a little randomly but lasts on 30 seconds - 1 minute although it's enough to alarm me for that time period.
