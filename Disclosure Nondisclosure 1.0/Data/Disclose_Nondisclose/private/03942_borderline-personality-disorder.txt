My husbandI is extremely good looking and charming on a very superficial level.  That is how I got conned.  He murdered my sister's boyfriend by ramming into his car and causing a deadly accident on the highway.  That was  8 months after we got married.  He only married me to get his green card; he was an illegal alien.  He robbed my aunts' houses in the second year of our marriage taking thousands of dollars of jewelry.  He continually steals and throws away important personal property of mine like university transcripts, my eyeglasses, my money, etc.  He has rammed into my mother's and my sister's parked cars causing expensive damage.  He has put GPS devices on I don't know how many of my family members stalking them at will.  This past December, he boarded a plane and before seeing his mistress, stalked my sister's ex-husband and pushed him onto a busy highway where my sister's ex-husband died with horrible injuries leaving behind a grief-stricken nine-yr-old daughter and other family.  My problem is I can't prove any of this and no one in my family believes me.  But I know it's all true.  My husband told me he would kill me if I left him and I'm scared what he would do to my family.  Also we have a son and I fear what he would do to our son if I left him.  He has sexually abused our son by fondling his genitals at will and has told me that he will take his son and go back home to Pakistan if I try to leave him.  I used to ask myself why I'm with such a man but I've been having flashbacks and now remember how my father raped and beat me when I was eight and fondled my breasts until I was twelve.  The sexual abuse ended when I started complaining persistently to my mother who when I first complained at the age of eight refused to believe me and then acted like it was my fault and then acted like I had to put up with it to keep the family together and ensure it was financially supported.  What can I do to stop my husband from killing people?
