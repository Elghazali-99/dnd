Hi,
 We're happy to introduce our newest feature - Health Pages. Health Pages are public documents on health topics created in collaboration by MedHelp users. So much more than a dictionary, they can be a compilation of FAQs, a listing of relevant articles and news, a summary of recent research, or any other information that members of the community might find useful.
 Health Pages were designed to be a collaborative effort to share information, so any user in the community can contribute by editing a Health Page.
 The very first Mental Health Health Page, a list of common Mental Health acronyms is now live as an example at: 
http://www.medhelp.org/health_pages/Mental+Health/Know-Your-Code---Acronyms/show/4?cid=60. You can edit this to add your own acronyms and also create your own Health Pages. To view all Health Pages, simply click on the "Health Pages" link at the top right of the community. Also, new pages will appear in the recent activity box to the right.
 This is a brand new feature that we're very excited about here, so please let us know what you think. Your feedback will be critical in helping future updates and enhancements.
