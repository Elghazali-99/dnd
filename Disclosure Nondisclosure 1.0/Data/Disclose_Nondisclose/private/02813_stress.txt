im a 19yr old firl on a dergree in the uk and iv always had problems with losing things. i experienced some therapy when i was younger for other non related issues but i discussed this problem that i have there, apparently its not serious.
but its starting to become a real problem again.
i only lose things when i get very stressed. so far for my course i have lost 2 sketchbooks and a folder. i also lose things outside of the course. im on the fourth set of keys for my house and i dont buy mobile phones cos im afraid i'll lose them and its a waste of money so i just use hand me downs.
it may not seem that much and quite an unserious problem but its starting to really depress me and i feel humiliated as everyone tells me the same thing. be more organized. sort yourself out.
i try really hard and im starting to think that maybe im losing things to allow myself to feel upset.
im not sure whether im making excuses for myself or whether forgetfulness is a form of OCD or dyspraxia... anyhow i'm babbling, if anyone knows anything that could help me i'd really appraciate it.
thanks :)
