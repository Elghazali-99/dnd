For past month I have developed a constant chest pain, also a shooting sharp pain to both sides of chest occationally.I will also have frequent abdomital pains that float. The constant chest pain sits right under the breast bones. but can not pin point exactly how high. 
I run a couple miles every day, hit the punching bag for half hour or beter, and work out (abs) mostly for a while. the first part (5 minutes) or so kind of *****. but after that. i feel great. No problem. if i could work out all day, i would. its the best I  feel all day. When I am done working out, about 15-20 minutes later. i can feel the chest pains coming back. With in the hour, the pain is back, and back to the occation sharp pains through out. 
This has been building the past month, getting worse. i only started the working out a few weeks back, the pains had started before i started doing this.The sharp paiins are new since I started this. 2 or 3 days out of he pst few weeks, i could barely find energy to do any thing. But once i could get going, I was ok untill a sit down and stop. 
I stop to see a doctor, blood presure is fine, breathing is fine, he told me be not going to be arterys. As the work outs i do would not be able to do so. 
Could not really get any sort of answer out of him, I am wondering if any one out there has had this symptoms, and may know where i should go looking for answers.
