Hi I recently honorably discharged from the Navy after serving five years. I have been battling depression for the past year. I wake up in the morning and have zero motivation to do anything. I want to do various things that need to be done around the house but when I go to do it but I can't strike up any motivation. My wife works and i don't. I have been applying for various jobs everyday but I never get any replies back. I always ask myself what this life is for? I can't figure out the answer. I feel life is money, entertainment, politics, and just the normal american way of life is bogus. I feel as if it's expected for you to just work, work, work and not enjoy anything else. Granted i do not work because i receive VA disability but it just seems like all life is, is work. My self-esteem and confidence is nothing. I am not proud of myself for anything. Yes i did serve my country for 5 years but i feel like that doesn't really mean much. I have attempted to go to school but couldn't go anymore due to depression issues. I am just lost and don't how to make myself feel accomplished and proud. I would really appreciate some advice and recommendations. 
 Thanks for reading
