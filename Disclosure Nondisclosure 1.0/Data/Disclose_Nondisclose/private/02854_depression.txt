I haven't actually been diagnosed with depression or what not but I am so unhappy. I'm 16 and have everything I want. I am so lucky to have such loving wonderful parents who are always there and give me their world but I never seem to be happy. I turn up to school everyday with this big smile on my face but inside I am falling apart. I look back at my lower years, when I was 11/12, I was at my happiest, everything was going well for me. I'm now I'm sixth form, and i am the unhappiest I've ever been in my entire life. I cry nearly every night and get upset over everything. I have a group of 'friends' but they do nothing for me, they expect everything but they ***** behind my back and they're never for me. Literally, I just hang around with them because there is no one else. I've lost interest in everything, I comfort eat because there just seems nothing else to. The only time I've ever been happy in these last two years is when I was drunk. I really wish I could change because it's killing me and my parents. I just need some sort of technique to help me. I'm not getting counselling because it doesn't help at all. I am trying to be happy I am and I feel so bad for my mum and dad because they are the best parents you could wish for and I love them so much but I'm never happy. I am so so negative about everything. The only thing that is keeping me motivated is getting the best results possible in my a levels so I can go to uni and forget everything
