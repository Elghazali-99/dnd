I recently learned a bit about bpd from a YouTuber's Psychology 101 episode on personality disorders. When I realized that my sister may have bpd, I did a little more research, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to fit. She has suffered from depression off and on for most of her life, following a traumatic childhood. She has a history of self harm and suicidal thoughts, threatening to take her own life a few times, landing herself in a local psych ward. She has a tendency to get upset over minor things, and create rifts between herself and others. The most recent and ongoing episode has been my request to be called by a different name and set of pronouns because of my gender identity. She took this as a personal attack and stated that she had to protect her children from me and my problem. More than being offended, I hurt for her. Our mom has tried to reason with her, which has resulted in my sister unfriending and blocking my mom on Facebook. We don't live in the same town, and I have no way of contacting her now, but I really want to her to receive help, is there anything either of us can do?
