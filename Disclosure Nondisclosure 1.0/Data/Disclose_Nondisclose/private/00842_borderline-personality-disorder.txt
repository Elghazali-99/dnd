I have started to worry that I may have BPD. I have had a horrible year, which included numerous arguments with my father and losing basically every friend i have had.One friend told me I was too needy and didn't understand that she had a life too. She also said my moods were very black and white. We were either best friends or not friends at all. She is studying to be a psychologist so I asked her about this and she said it sounds like BPD. I have not told her everything being we are not so close anymore. I constantly feel like I am alone and people are out to get me. I always wonder if someone is out to get me or are secretely planning to hurt me. I can go from happy to extremely depressed in a day and when I switch between moods I am rather confused. I have begun to have anxiety attacks where I can not stop crying and shaking and almost throw up. This usually followed by a somewhat numbness and lack of strength in my extremities. Since I was younger the thought of hurting myself was there but I knew I would never be able to do it. However, now when I get into one of these moods it is like something takes over my mind and I come very close to doing something to harm myself. It takes alot for me not to do anything and try to control myself. I am starting to worry. I just don't know what to do anymore.
