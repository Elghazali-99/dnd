My doctor diagnosed me with Schizoid Personality Disorder. I'm 18 and female. I have had hallucinations (auditory and visual) since I was a child. The older I got the worse it became. The girl I hear is rude, she bothers me with suggestions that I should kill myself, or my family. Or that I need to leave (i don't know where to), She called me a bi*ch and showed me all these things I didn't want to see.
 For the longest time (even now) I have weird delusions such as looking into peoples eyes means they can read my thoughts, or that thinking to much about the past means I'll get sucked into it and be stuck there forever which terrifies me endlessly.
 I had halllucinations as a kid there their were millions of bee's in my room. I could hear them, and sort of see them. I saw their sound waves. If I left my room the sound would fade slowly the further away I got, than the closer I came to my room the louder it became. Their wasn't a logical explanation for this.
 I know that Schizoid Personality Disorder doesn't involve bouts of Schizophrenia, but I think I have bouts of Schizophrenia (it's possible with Schizotypal), because my hallucinations happen occasionally but last about a few weeks.
I'm constantly depressed and suicidal, I have been since I was ten years old. I have violent thoughts of murdering my family in the most brutal way. My mom's boyfriend hunts so their are a lot of guns all over the house, I know how to shoot them all as well.
But I have a plan after I kill them that involves skinning and a lot of other stuff.
 I don't know how to tell this to my new Psychiatrist. I know he's been to school and must know his stuff, but I still really need him to understand that I need some help with my hallucinations and delusions.
Any advice?
