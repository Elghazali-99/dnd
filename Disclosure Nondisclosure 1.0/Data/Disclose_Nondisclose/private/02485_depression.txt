Never talked about how I feel, but lately feeling like if I don't I will blow up.  I was diagnosed with diabetes insipidus a few months ago and it gets worse when my anxiety goes up, I have a very stressful job and work from home.  If I needed to pin point when I started feeling "down" it was probably when I had my 2nd son about 4 yrs ago.  Feeling trapped in my own home, don't like to leave my house, I yell a lot and have completely loss interest in being intimate with my husband.  He is a wonderful man and doesn't deserve someone that is always in a bad mood and doesnt want to do anything.  Find myself crying for absolutely no reason.  The more I try to hide all that is going on the worse I feel.  I have gained so much weight in the last year and half I feel disgusting and I know it bothers my husband but he will never tell me.  Why am I feeling this way, I can't sleep, zero energy and have isolated my friends, what can I do to turn my life around?  It's not fair to my kids or my husband.  Ive been on xanax, clonazepam, ambien and none have made me feel better.
