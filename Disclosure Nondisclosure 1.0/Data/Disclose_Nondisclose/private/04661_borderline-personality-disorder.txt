This probably sounds ridiculously petit and like some teenagers problem, so sorry about this. 
Baisically i'm 18 and straight, though every day I seem to be losing social confidence around near enough everyone, even boys i'm vaguely friendly with, so especially a half decent good looking girl! i've never had a girlfriend and never done anything, and it doesn't look like that's about to change soon. I have a couple of very good friends who are women though close friends is all it will ever be. 
What i'm worried about is the increasing number of times a week when i feel unstoppably depressed and lonely, as well as questioning how boring I am, depite the fact that deep down I know quite a lot of the time I can actually be quite witty/ecentric/interesting with certain people at certain times and have virtually no enemies, but am instead thought of (or at least I get a strong impression of this!) quite fondly.
Any help as to what i can do to feel better about my self and progress in the whole relationship thing would be greatly appreciated.
