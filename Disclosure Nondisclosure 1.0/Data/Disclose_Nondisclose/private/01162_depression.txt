I have had my 5th wrist surgery. I now have a full fusion. It is so hard to move forward in life now. I joined the marines back in 2001. I lost many friends over seas and like most of us i wonder why them and not me?! I moved on in life working everyday as hard and as long as I could. That is how i justify me living and them not. I prove i belong here on earth. I would be so tired when I get home i would play with my kids, help with homework and go to bed. No time to think.... They always said in the Corps that the most dangerous thing on this earth is a man with nothing to do. I can no longer do physical work.... I feel like i have let everyone down. For the 1st time in my life i can't act like i am superman. I understand i am focusing on the bad... But with a 7 out of a 10 on avg for the pain it is hard to act like everything is ok... It is my right wrist/ my main hand. I can no longer play the Piano,swim, or anything that i once loved... My question is ( if anyone has ever had something like this happen) please tell me what you did to help you move on.
