My Partner suffers with Schizo-effective disorder and hears voices.  We have been together for 16 years and through out this time I have done as much research as possible.  For the first time he has been receiving death threats from the voices and although he is normally a very composed man, today he cried out for help and even called the Police.  The police got the mental health crisis team to contact him and to my annoyance they told him to relax and watch some T.V.  I haven't dealt with the situation at all well as I have mental ill health, okay it's Borderline Personality Disorder.  When on the phone to him I was crying my eyes out and when I tried to get further help from the police I had a panic attack on the phone.  I've been USELESS.  He is going to stay with a friend for a while even though I feel he ought to be in hospital.  I feel so disturbed, as I remember a patient I spoke to when I was in a mental health hospital, the patient had Schizophrenia with the voices gave him constant death threats - it shook me up so much.  I am really frightened for Mark (my partner).  How do I cope with my feelings regarding this?  I can't help myself getting so involved and am finding it harder and harder to stick to reality.
