I am an educated woman who actully worked in Law Enforcment before I married my husband.  We have been married for 8 years and have 2 children.  Things were good for a year, and then our money started to dry up.  He wanted me to work, but he could not bring much home.  He is a farmer in partnership with his brothers.  All of his brothers have built new homes on partnership land which they never paid for, yet we live in an old house that has lots of problems and have never got anything. Our children used to go to a privet lutheran school, but when I got on the school board I raised red flags of mistreatment of students, when the male principle said the my 7 year old daughter was in loved him. I pulled my children, now no one speaks to me, not my sister in laws, all of them have parties ect but  no one includes me or my children.  My husband is now qouting statments that were said by church members like not speaking to others because you only hear gossip and slander.  I fell alone and isolated.  My husband is very distant and does not even touch me.  I am poor emotional hurt and alone. Please help.
