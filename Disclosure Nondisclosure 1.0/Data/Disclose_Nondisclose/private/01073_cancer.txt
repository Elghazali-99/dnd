I went in to get a facial and the esthetician thought my small mole was a pimple and was trying to pop it and actually did make it bleed. I didn't even realize that it was my mole she was trying to pop, I figured I had a pimple there because I get facials all the time and no one has ever mistaken my mole for a pimple ever...When she was done working on it, I knew something was wrong because it was super sore and felt different than how it feels when a pimple is popped. She told me that she saw "pus" come out of it. I asked to see a mirror because I just felt something was wrong and sure enough, she completely took my mole off. It was bleeding like crazy and I had to hold a tissue over and apply pressure to get it to stop. 
 This happened yesterday and there is a scab over it now. Even though it is small, I am really sad and worried that something is going to be wrong with it now. I am thinking of making an appointment with a Dermatologist just to be sure everything is okay. Is it really bad that this happened?
