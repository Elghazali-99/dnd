Hi
I was diagnosed with schizophrenia about 2 years ago.At that time I took risperdal and helpirodol along with ambien for a period of 3 months.The doctor quite unnecessarily prescribed ambien even though I did not have any sleep problems.Any way after 3 months a different doctor stopped the ambien.I was totally without sleep for nights on end.So they prescribed zopiclone , followed by temazpam.These could only give me 4 hours of sleep every night.
After another 3 months like this the doctor switched me to zyprexa 10mg.This I found to be a great relief and  was sleeping 7 hours a day on zyprexa alone.After about 6 months like this the zyprexa dosage was reduced to 5mg.This worked fine and I was still sleeping about 6-7 hours daily.This continued for a year but now I am able to sleep only 5 hours on 5mg of zyprexa.I may have to up the dosage to sleep well.While this is not a major problem I feel that this will eventually lead to disaster because we cant up the dosage continuously as I develop tolerance. My doctor is not bothered about my sleep problems.I would like to be pill free now as my delusions have been completely cured,Really I dont mind taking zyprexa, but after seeing many horror stories on the internet about ambien and zyprexa dependence/addiction  I am very concerned about what I should do.I would much appreciate if someone can throw some light on this.
regards
John
