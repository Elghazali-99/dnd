Hello,
Just a little background. The first time I took Sertraline was 6 years ago for chronic fatigue, low energy and brain fog after having a bad stomach virus. My doc prescribed 50mg, but after the first dose I had terrible side effects. She then told me to take half the pill. I took the 25mg for a few months, then increased to 50mg for a short time before tapering off. I was only on Sertraline for about 7 months, and then my life was back to normal!
 Now, after dealing with stress and another stomach virus(which I had 3 months ago), I'm experiencing the same symptoms again. My fatigue is milder this time around, but brain fog is still pretty bad. I also discovered I have a severe vitamin D deficiency. My doc prescribed vitamin D2 50,000IU and Sertraline(25mg).  I have been on the Sertraline for a week now, but my reaction to the medication is different this time around. I'm experiencing insomnia, tingling sensations in my hands and head, nausea, feeling spaced out and a lower mood. Does the same SSRI work the second time around? Could I be having these side effects because 25mg is too high of a dose for me?
