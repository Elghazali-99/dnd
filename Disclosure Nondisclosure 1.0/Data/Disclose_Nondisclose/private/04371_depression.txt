I am a 48 yr old female diagnosed with recurring severe depression.  When I am not taking my meds, I am tired, can sleep all day, am completely unmotivated to do anything and do not want to socialize with anyone.  I have tried several different meds and am currently taking Celexa and Adderall XR.  My psy says that adding the Adderall will "kick in the Celexa" and make it work better.  I have a love/hate realationship with the Adderall.  Although I am prescribed 20 mg Adderall XR 3 times a day, I never take all 3 pills a day.  Right now I am down to 1 pill a day.  I love the fact that the Adderall gives me energy but I hate that after a few days of taking it I feel physically exhausted.  I have tried to give up the Adderall but I always go back to it because taking the Celexa alone doesn't work.  I sit around and think about everything I should be doing at home but am unmotivated to do them and I have a hard time getting through the day at work.  After a few days of this, I give up and start taking the Adderall again.  I get more done at my job and have a better attitude when I take the Adderall.  Although most people have lost weight while taking Adderall I have gained about 15 pounds which, of course, doesn't help the depression. 
 Does anyone have the same experience while taking an SSRI and Adderall XR together.
