I'm seventeen years old. The first day of my period was about five or six days before I lost my virginity (it properly finished the day before.) We had sex twice and used a condom but I think it rolled off a bit when he was pullin out, but anyway... we had sex twice. I was bleeding at the time because it was my first time, but this was just a little bit and stopped that night. Then five or six days later I started bleeding again - I put my hand down and it seemed more pink and slimy than usual, and that night there was lots of brown blood in my knickers. Since then and for the next four or so days I've had brown spotting, I've been wearing panty-liners and it's not too much but everytime I go to the toilet and wipe there's some brown slime. I've been on my period since I was 12/13 and I don't really keep track of it but I've never had it one week apart and it's not the same as my period normally is. Can anyone explain this to me and help ease my mind - sorry if it's hard to read this big block of text. If you have any questions to ask me if you need more info please send me a message! I don't know if I'm pregnant or anything, but I really want to know what's going on. After the initial bleeding right after sex I was fine for about five or six days - then I had quite a lot of brown stuff, and now it's just kind of spotting every day... Thank you so much if you can help me! Please message me if you need any more info!
