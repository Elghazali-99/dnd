I am a university student in my second year, and since September I have been ill with an undiagnosed illness which causes me to be seriously ill (vomiting, diarrhoea etc) for up to a week approximately every few weeks, but there is no pattern. My health is never quite right in between these episodes: I have lost 20% of my body weight alone. I have had many tests looking, mainly looking at crohn's disease possibilities, but so far there are frustratingly no results. 
This has had significant effects upon my life, both my university and social life. My illness was too much for my boyfriend of 1.5 years to cope with so we split two months ago, and I have missed out on alot of my university social life, often having to stay in while friends go out. 
Within the past month I have started experiencing major mood swings. I can be happy one moment, severely depressed another or sometimes angry, for no reason. I am worried this makes me difficult to be around, so often shut myself away as a result. Is this a result of my unknown illness and it's symptoms? Or the events of the past months getting to me? I try to stay positive but it can all get to me in my depressed moods. Is there also anyway I can hope to tackle this, as diagnosis and treatment seem still very far off.
Thank you for reading
