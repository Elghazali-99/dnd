I have conversations in my head sometimes. It could be when I'm sad, myself would be trying to cheer myself up. Sometimes I do it when I'm happy to and just being goofy, acting with myself or just making silly faces in the mirror.
 When I'm really depressed my head just keep making up sad things causing me to cry. I may or may not have depression. Everyone in my family is going through a really hard time. So my house is not a happy place all the time. At the moment I'm at my grandparents house for another month. I keep fearing going back home and reliving the bad things that had happened. Every time I think about going I get stressed out then depressed.
 Of topic, but anyway. Every once in a while I have conversations with my self in my head. Sometimes, like when I'm sad or depressed, I start to think I'm crazy and just want my head to stop talking. To get rid of it I have to distracted myself. If I'm depressed I sing about my sadness an I feel better. When I'm sad I would watch funny videos to cheer my self up.
 I'm going off topic again. My mind is all over the place at the moment. I have had an anxiety attack four months ago, and I sometimes get very depressed. I think I've talked to my self in my head for as long as I can remember. However I can't confirm that. So is it normal, or am I going crazy bonkers and need to seek help?
