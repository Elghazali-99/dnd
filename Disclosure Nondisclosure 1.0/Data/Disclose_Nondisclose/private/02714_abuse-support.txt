I have this best friend, well ex-friend. For eight years i have stood by her side loyal, never did i ever give up on her till now. We were both abused when we where younger. Both sexually, emotionaly, yet she was physically abused. We never let this get us down, we worked hard as students, and in the community we stood out. Recently though, about a year ago, everything changed. She met this boy, who i never took a liking to. We never fought over boys, but he was no regular boy. I knew something was wrong with him, and I tried to get her to see my point of view. All-in-all she winded up getting pregnant. And i supported her throughout her pregnancy, while he cheated on her over and over again, even in her face. She had the baby and was struggling. About a month or two ago i had found out that he beats her, he even put a knife to her throat, and beat her while she was holding the baby. Me and her other friends took her away from him. We tried to talk to her, show her that there are other men out there, good men. But she went back to him the very next day. Once she was with him i got a phone call, she exchanged harsh words towards me, and since i have not spoken a word to her. I refuse to see her, I still care about her, but i will not risk my health for her. Her mother and a family friend called me today asking me to be a big part in an intervention that they want to set up. I believe it will be pointless. Yet I still have hope that one day, she will let go of this ***, she calls her boyfriend. So what is the best way to go about doing this?
