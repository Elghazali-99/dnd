I been asking a lot of questions on here and I appreciate your help a lot.....My two youngest children have been greatly affected by their father leaving.....My 21 yr old daughter rushed home to look after me and she just could not cope with my crying and misery and she flew to Darwin (2000 kms away) to be with her boyfriend.....she stopped talking to me and never called home....we use to talk every day.....I missed her a lot....so no husband and no daughter and now my 17 year old son was at home.....when ex and I would fight ex would call him and say mum out of control (just so my son could witness his mum out of control) finally my son and I had a huge fight around week 2 and he told me....to put my head up and dont let ex ruin me....I deserve better....since that fight we dont talk about dad and I never say anything negative....I encourage him to see his father.....I asked him yesterday how it was going with dad and he said oh ok....he doesnt know me like you know me.......Then my daughter came home for a visit and she was very angry when I picked her up....I said we have a three hour drive so out with it......she was pissed off that I lost it so much and I should of kept it together......I didnt argue with her I just agreed....she then went on to say that she was proud of where I am now and she will always love me no matter what.....we also agreed not to talk about dad and I never talk negative to her.....I make special effort to be happy when the kids are home and it is going great with the kids now. ....we talk everyday again....but she did say that she has no time or respect for her father and she has no desire to make an effort with him.....and she said her brother had lost all respect for his father and he is worried about who he should look at for a male role model.....I am very worried about them and I dont want them to loose their faith in marriage and love.....Their father is now trying really hard to be his mate and not a father and my son is very uncomfortable with this.....is there anthing else I can do to help with their heeling........please help.......
