mandy876    The kids who I let move in with me have about  drained me of my retirement.  trying to figure how to get the credit card paid.  and they are ready to go shopping I told them not on the credit card.  but they don't listen.  they drag me along to pay. the youngest 26 is pregnant her little girl is due in April.  she has a 8 year old boy and a 2 year old. gets kind of crazy around here. the young one is getting kind of bossy.  hope it is her pregnancy.  she got mad because they woke me up and wanted me to get dressed and go to game house to buy him a game.  I got mad I got my credit card and the day before is was 3,000.00.  I am a widow with a small social security check and the widows share of my husbands retirement.  I don't think I can take much more.  I lost my mom dad and my husband an 2 of my best friends.i  am so lonely.  They want talk to me.  I just snacked for a couple of days.  my oldest niece is bi polar and manic depressive anxiety and a little skitzo.  that is not her problem.  I can kind of understand her she has a problem controling what she says and does. I just want to be with my family.  when they died my mom was the last I had kind of held it together but that what was holding me together.  I went to my doctor and he said cant you smile and broke down and started crying. I am on Effexor 75. I have always managed to hold it together but that broke me apart.   mandy876
