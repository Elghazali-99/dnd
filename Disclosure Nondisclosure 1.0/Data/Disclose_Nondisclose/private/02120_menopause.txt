I feel like Im losing my mind !!!!! Im 45 and for the last week its been nothing but clusters of panic attacks !! I was given .25 mg xanax for my last hospital stay in the ICU when they couldnt figure out after echos and stress tests why my heart rate went nuts .. they said it was a normal  sinus rhythm but too fast so they gave me meds to calm them and got them to about 100 beats per min and said that was "normal" Im sorry but I was a e.m.t for many years 60 to 80 is normal and well mine at rest is much lower (normally) but anyway i was able to get them back to my normal rate before they discharged me and now 2 months later in this last week ive taken alot of xanax to calm down ..I was only using it when i felt like my heart was going to race again and managed to only use 10 of my 30 tab script in 2 months but now in the last week ive been taking them every day because i get theses flutters in my heart like its skipping a beats or something then my heart races out of control.. the xanax helps but it takes a while I havent slept well either  ..I feel like Ive lost all control and somedays want to just lie in bed im afraid something is going to set me off into another panic attack and Im so exausted from this I just cant take anymore !! is there anyone who feel like me ??
