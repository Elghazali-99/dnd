I have had extreme lower back pain mostly at night when I "try" to sleep.  Have lost aloot of sleep. I have mised my period for six months and believe it is menapause related of course . I am fifty. I stay active, but have been in alot of pain. Feel as though something is out of alignment.I have gained over twenty pounds this year and miost of it seems to be in my stomach., actually right under my ribcage it starts protruding. I have alwasy been petite and slender.I have also had unbelievable pressure on my bladder from time to time, more gas than usual, and werid bowels.So. am I menopausal, or just plain crazy> I am the farthest thing from a hyperchondriac, and usually only use natural therapies and herbs, so I am reluctant to go on any pain meds. Can someone tell me the first step to take if I di need to actually go to see a medical doctor that is not a naturalpathic one I get alot of relief from massage and acupumcture, but I want to get to the heart of the cause. thank you so much.
