I'm 15 and I've been self-conscious since last year. I weigh 52kg and I'm a 4 feet 11 inches.
I've been to conscious about myself and my physical body leading me to depression thinking that I'm too fat, too short, and ugly. The thoughts kept getting to me to the point that I would get jealous when I see my friends. Whenever I see them, I think, "Am I the only fat one in our group?". I get nervous when I meet up with them because of how I dress, and because of the fats I have, I end up not confident enough.
 Other than my own thoughts disrupting me, it was also the nasty comments I get from time to time. It was the comments that my family has told me since I has 10. They kept telling me to lose weight because I'm too fat, and I'll never grow if I'm fat---To the point that I couldn't take it anymore that I tried starving myself. I didn't eat for a few days, and somehow I've had these strong urges to do something, but unable to find the solution.
 Not only my family make comments, but also my 'friends'. I don't think I can even call them my friends for calling me a 'stuck-up *****', a 'know-it-all', a 'try-hard-*****', and '******* fat try-hard animator'..
 I've thought about my weight a lot of times, and also my height. I'm 4 feet 11 inches. I'm 15. My mom is 5 feet 3 inches, and my dad is 5 feet 9 inches. I read through a lot of blogs saying that they grew really tall even if their parents were really short.
 So I held onto a little string of hope that maybe I could get taller if I grew thinner.
 I've tried working out (simple jogging, exercises and dancing), but then it wouldn't work since I can't even maintain it due to the lack of time and laziness. Nothing worked :(
 That's when depression struck me. 
 There was a time that my parents found out about my depression , they said they'd help me out, but somehow I think it's not helping at all. I still feel so fat..
 It's like, everything people say to me, it's all imprinted on my head. It hurts so much..
 Is there any way to help reduce my self-consciousness? Is my weight and height healthy? And is it still possible for me to grow?
  Thank you so much for taking your time to read and probably give me some advice about this. It means so much:)
