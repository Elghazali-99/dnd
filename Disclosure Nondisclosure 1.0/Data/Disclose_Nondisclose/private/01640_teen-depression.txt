My daughter was diagnosed with tyoe 1 diabetes at 2yrs,2 months.  At present she will be 15 on Dec 2.  REcontly I had noticed a trend toward not checking blood sugars at school and very much lassez faire attitude in taking care of her insulinn needs etc.  As a single Mom with no family or outside support I was tod to try a 'health'  psychologist.  thinking this might be an obective 3rd party to help her recognize the need to take responsibilty and move forward.  In 20 minutes he ascertained my daughter was clinically depressed and entertaining thoughts of suicide as most teens do at one ttime or another.  Right away more therapy and anti depressants immediately!!  I know I am just a lay person but more drugs and antipressants go hand in hand with an increase of suicidal thoughts in teens.  This kid has excellent grades, eats sleeps and lives for life on her academic team at school
 What have I done???  All I wanted was some constructive support for my daughter and was given a recipe for disaster...Does anybody out there have similiar issues///  would love to hear from your
