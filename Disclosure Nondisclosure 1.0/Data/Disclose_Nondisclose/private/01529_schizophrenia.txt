Please help me!My 21 y old son had 6 m before auditory hallucination and calld the police claiming that neighbor yells at him, was very upset. Since he refused psychiatric exam. psychiatrist adviced us to give him 10 mg Olanzapine (Zyprexa) and when it gets better to lower the dose (or raise if vorse).BUT I DONT KNOW IS IT BETTERor WORSE? Beter is that he is not agressive, hostile and irritable anymore.But now he is not interested at nothing at all,not even TV.Only sitting in the dark room all day and night,toking or arguing with someone -auditory hallucinations.Only sometimes wants to go to cafe with his father because has no friends.Should I increase the dose (last 3 m takes 15 mg) to reduce halucinattion or reduce because of pronounced negative simptoms?He well tolerates Olanzapyne.How long is recomanded to take antypsihotics?What are Yours expiriences?I have to mention that he used marihuana 4,5 y ago, but NOT anymore.Sorry for my Engleash, not my maternal langueage!Is there any of your precious advice?
