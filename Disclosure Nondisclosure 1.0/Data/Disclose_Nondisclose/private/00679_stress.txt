Even after lapse of so much time my son complains different problems like pain in back side of scrotal area, closed nose and dizziness, giddiness with body pains. A boy of 24 year age why should he have all these problems. He was shown to several doctors so far. No body has indicated any major problems. His  test for urine culture was done one month back which was normal. He was given tabs 'augmetin' for two weeks for pain. He has got a cyst also in scrotal but it is not major. He was checked  by sex doctor for VD diseases who performed physical check of his organs also and inform no problem. He was having infection in his semen as per the tests done one year back for which he was given treatment but after that again semen check was not done. He was having low semen count also but he is still unmarried. He says that his problems have started since his sex encounter in Canada. He was also suffering from depression for one year back which reoccurred recently and is taking medicine like Mirtaz 15mg (one daily)and fludac (daily 2) . What could be the reason for these symptoms. What are the tests he requires to undergo. Her urine test was showing presence of puss cells 2 to 4. His scrotal scan shows mild vericocele and prostate enlargement to little extent. Which was not given importance by the doctor. He says he is not able to go out in the morning cold. He says he is getting cold very fast on taking any thing cold like ice cream.
