A tormented friend of mine has been taking meds/pain killers for years in order to deal with a lifetime depression that was mostly hidden from friends all through life till after college that became overwhelming when his mother died in 2000. He used to take vicodin, oxycontin, percoset for years. He has been taking tramodol since 2001.
I would like to know what the symptoms are when someone takes this for years; and if they over dose; and withdrawl.
he has has many  over two dozen seizures that I know of (and some that I have seen the results of-bIack eyes from falling right on his face-no hands from believe from the overdosing, he has lost tremendous amounts of weighs and is 5'9" and used to weigh 175 lbs of solid muscle(after being overweight his whole life from childhood). He is down to 130 lbs and losing more; he is wretching and does not eat or have a desire to eat; he has no stamina; he has memory loss; he is irritable to the point of being aggressive; then melancoly; then introspective.
