I had made a thread about two months ago under Lymphadenopathy . No one had responded to it. However things have changed since then. I have had this for appox 3 months but the changes have happened within two weeks. I have a puckered up skin? under my armpit. It looks like it's attached to the lump maybe that I have. The lump is prob about a half dollar size, kinda hard, stays put. The lump doesn't hurt but this pucker up skin does at the tender touch of it, or with my arm down. I had seen two doctors. The first one said Lymphadenopathy, and then I saw my dr and all she did was touch it and said it was a cyst... no xrays,u/s or anything and that was before the puckering happened.
 I am gotta post a pic , so please ignore the lil hairy armpit. I am afraid to shave it, or even put deordeant on.
  So does anyone know what this may be? Had it for appox 3 months ( the lump ) but recently developed puckered skin. I go back to the doctors on the 15th for a follow up, but if this is something serious that needs to be checked asap then I will go in tomorrow.
