Dear doctors,
My dad has been diagnosed with cancer and also have some kidney stones. There are some tumors around his neck and armpits regions. Biopsy results confirmed carcinomas with less differentiated cells. Sonogram, X-rays, and some other tests confirmed the thyroid gland is not the origin. Localized and whole body PET scans also couldn't find the origin. Now, there would be two choices, either doing surgery and followed by  chemotherapy or starting with chemotherapy. Since the origin is unknown or not yet to determine, chemotherapy would be a general but not a specific (targeted) approach. And hopefully, there  are some agents that could trigger a response and kill these tumor cells. That would avoid the risk or side effects involved with cancer surgery. However, these tumors are quite aggressive and growing fast. A surgery would help to remove these tumors but the origin is still there. A sub-sequence chemotherapy could help to control and maybe destroy the other possible small tumors that left behind during the surgery. That being said, when the chemotherapy is stopped and the origin is not treated. These tumors could come back again. 
So, my question is: should my dad choose to start with a surgery or a general chemotherapy? Thank you so much.
