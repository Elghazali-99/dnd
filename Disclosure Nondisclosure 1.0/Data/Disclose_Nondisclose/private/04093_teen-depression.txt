I'm a 14 year old female, and for... maybe 6 months or so I've been a completely different person. I'm not happy anymore, I can't sleep, I've lost weight, I have no motivation to do anything, I have no friends, I can't concentrate in school anymore, and everything seems to be going downhill. I find myself crying for no absolute reason and I really just want to give up. I feel like I'm causing pain to those around me and I hurt everyone I let in. I've become completely introverted, and that's the opposite of what I used to be. 
 I'm called 'dead' and 'zombie-ish' on a daily basis. Something is wrong with me. Everything and anything gets on my nerves and I just want to lash out on everyone. I've been to my doctor at least 6 times this year, I've been told to take Melatonin (a sleeping suppliment) and those didn't work. Soooo.... now I'm on Trazodone and it doesn't seem to be helping. It just makes me feel utterly whacko. I just... don't know what to do anymore, who to turn to...
