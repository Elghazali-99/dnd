My last period ended on the 6th of June, which was by far the most stressful month I've ever encountered. On the 20th of June, I gave oral and swallowed, but cleaned up and my clothes remained on so there was no semen in or around my vagina. 
Today marks the 5th of July. I DID get my period, or what seems to look like it. It was very light and dark brown. When I first had it this morning, there was a small amount of blood. Could this be dark brown since it is old blood that should've came last week?
Over the past few days, my breasts have grown. There's been veins visible all around the skin reaching to the nipple. One day when I squeezed, there was a bit of a clear discharge. My nipples have gotten darker and larger. No, they have not been aching or sensitive. 
I noticed today that my mouth had an odd taste to it. My sense of smell has stayed normal. I've also had cramps and headaches. 
Since I am a virgin and pregnancy cannot be the answer considering that there has never been a penis in me, what could be wrong? 
Could I be overthinking my symptoms and convincing my body?
Could these be signs of puberty?
Could these be PMS symptoms?
Could these be in relation to my hormones?
