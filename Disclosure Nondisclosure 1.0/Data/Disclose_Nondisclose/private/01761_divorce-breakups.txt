I am at the end of my rope. I am currently deployed and during the divorce proceedings the judge instructed her to keep me informed on the events in my children's lives while I was out of the country for work (military). She has not done that. I constantly argue with her regarding information about my children. When she does not respond to my emails inquiring how they are doing in school or if they were sick I get no response. When I get angry at her for doing that she throws back in my face that I am harassing her. I get no school info (I had to call their school from Kabul and get information from the school teachers), no pictures of them, no updates regarding them, no updates when she takes them away from the house on the times when she knows I call. it drives me insane. I did not want to get divorced but she insisted on it. During the proceedings it came out, through my discovery, that I was the only one faithful during the marriage. When that came out, she became hostile towards me and I feel she is punishing me using the children for her infidelity. I am open to suggestions.
