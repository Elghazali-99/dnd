Hello, my name is Abbie. I am 17 years old. I live in the Philippines, a place where there is no such an illness called depression. People would say depression is just a phase... Depressed people are crazy... Depressed people are just attention-seekers... And everytime I would tell to anyone, that it is a chemical imbalance, they would not believe me. And everytime I show them my scars, they would just think I'm crazy as hell. When the truth is, there is no one who understands me. And I'm feeling alone... My parents would not believe me, and would not bother to take me to a Psychologist, they think it's just a waste of time and money... But when the truth is, I'm getting worst. I've been anti-social, and the only one who makes me smile is my boyfriend(who don't even care about my depression, and thinks that i'm out of my mind, cutting my wrists). And I don't feel happy with my life anymore. My view in life is so deep, that I know everything has it consequences... You can't be happy when you're right, and you can't be right when you're happy... And now, all I think about is, how about I would end my life? ... But I don't want to be pathetic... And more people wouldn't like that way, they would think more that I'm just a crazy girl... There is so many things about me... I won't tell everything... Yet, what should I do? I can't hold back anymore.. Help me.
