Whenever I get really mad or really sad I usually bite. When I was younger I would hurt other people, saying something mean, pinching, pulling their hair, or punching them. I never got in trouble for it because I was good at making it look like it wasn't my fault and anything I couldn't brush off I didn't worry about since the people I hurt were usually too afraid of me to do anything. In the last four or five years however I decided that I didn't want to hurt other people anymore. Now when I get upset I bite myself. It's like there's so much building up in me that if I don't do something i'll lose it and hurt somebody else. I thought I had a pretty good handle on it since before I usually gave myself a bruise or whatever that would fade in a few days. Now however, it's gotten to the point where whenever I do it I break skin. I have two visible circular scars on either forearm, as well as on my knees and thighs, where my teeth pressed down. In some cases there are puncture marks from when I moved my head during the biting to get a better grip. I don't know what to do. I'm tired and my bones are ache and hurt from all the places I've hurt myself. I want to stop but whenever the urge hits I absolutely cannot control it, and even when I think I did calm down and get it under control, the next second i'll find myself biting again with no real memory of making a decision to do so.
