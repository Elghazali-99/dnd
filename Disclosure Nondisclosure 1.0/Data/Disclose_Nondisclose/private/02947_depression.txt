HI! I'm dealing wit tons of things now that Ive got my addiction to pills under control.... I am experiencing TONS of anxiety and depression! I'm flooded with memories and things that I have never dealt with! I lost my dad, my grandmother, and my daughters daddy to suicide and I'm feeling like it's all my fault! 3 people that close to me killing themselves? Yes, I shoulder the blame... I could have done more, shown more love,...IDK! I am always in tears and my heart is on my sleeve,,,, I no longer have pills to numb the pain and Im sinking into a pit of despair... Being raped, abused by many, foster homes, mother leaving me in the middle of a street and never coming back! Ive blocked these things out for so long and now it's all hitting me at once.... I'm trying desperately to reach out to help anyone that I can ... Im trying to make a difference in peoples life and I feel like Im failing so miserably! When im sleeping (the little I get) I am accosted by nightmares.... I just don't know how to deal with everything especially all at once. I can't afford therapy although Im sure that's what I need. My question is HOW do I even begin to deal with all of this? I need a plan of attack... I apologize if this isn't the correct forum??! I need some serious guidance... Im broken... No longer to proud to ask for help... I can't do this alone. The depression is kicking my behind. I only worked half a day this entire week... The rest of the time I was in bed...crying...Im completely isolated and find hardly any joy in anything! I can't stop the emotions or memories and its hurting so bad.... I am sorry for venting all this...
