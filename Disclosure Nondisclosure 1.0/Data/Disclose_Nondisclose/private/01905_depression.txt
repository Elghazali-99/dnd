I figured now is the perfect time to bring this up, as most of us, here in the US, are moving into fall, approaching winter.  It's getting darker earlier, and our nights are getting longer.  People with chronic depression are easily affected by things like the weather, amount of sunlight, rain, ect.  I know my depression worsens in the winter months, for sure. 
 "Seasonal affective disorder (also called SAD) is a type of depression that occurs at the same time every year. If you're like most people with seasonal affective disorder, your symptoms start in the fall and may continue into the winter months, sapping your energy and making you feel moody."
 Some people ONLY experience depressive symptoms at certain times of the year, while others have SAD as a concurrent diagnosis, along with clinical depression.  Even if you haven't been diagnosed as having SAD, I bet most of you will say that your moods and symptoms of depression worsen in the winter months.
 I'm posting a link to a very informative, helpful article about SAD from the great folks at the Mayo Clinic.  It describes different treatment options, one which is phototherapy, or exposure to light.  One thing you can do if you feel your depression worsens at this time of the year, is increase your exposure to natural sunlight.  Sit outside for an hour a day.  It doesn't have to be super sunny for you to benefit from the sun.
 Feel free to share your own experiences with SAD, or your prepensity to feel more depressed in the winter months.  It's important to mention, that only a doctor can actually diagnose SAD, and if you think you're suffering from it, please talk with your doctor.
 Wishing you all peace.
