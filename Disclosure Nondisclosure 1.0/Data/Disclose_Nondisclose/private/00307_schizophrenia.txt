ever since i was young i always had a very vivid imagination. when i was about 14/15 i began hearing voices or having thoughts i couldn't identify as my own, they seemed to possess higher knowledge of which i certainly couldn't be capable of comprehending. for days i could sit and write out things over without ever repeating yet they all seemed to string together, in a sort of theory-like pattern. sometimes they were about me talking in third person, other times they were about scientific philosophies and meanings of life. later on these voices began telling me to manipulate people for things, like drugs or alcohol or even affection. Later on i became a paranoid delusional, i stopped going to school because i thought everyone was saying things behind my back and i even lost a lot of friends because of it. i've had some pts in the past years and i think i suppressed something into my subconscious thought patterns. i smoke pot regularly and have been using it to self medicate my depression from what is emotionally scarring me and has been for years. however before i discovered pot, voices seem to control a lot of what did when i was younger and depressed. ei: cutting, the voices still tell me to do it but ever since i started smoking pot regularly i've been strong enough to stop. i know pot is linked to a lot of schizophrenia you find today but i've always thought i was a born schizophrenic however i'm worried. can your subconscious take over if you are conscious of it?
