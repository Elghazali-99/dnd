hello everyone,
hope all is well! Everything for the most part is okay with me and my new family ( finance and four month old) but I have been hospitalized twice within the past month and a half and now I am experiencing what I think is a tension headache/neck pain. The first visit to the er I found out I had a cyst in my lungs and the second time I was rushed to the hospital for upper abdominal pain. Which the abdominal pain basically was due to lack of eating, sleeping, stress, increase of stomach acid. Now with this tension headache and I researched a little about what can cause it and it kinda sounds like what the stomach pain was. 
inaddition to being a new mom, im also in recovery 1 year sober!, i also moved for the second time (due to landlord issues with the prior home). These are new things in my life. You also have being in a committed relationship at a young age - trying and dealing with whatever happens with that aswell. Ive always had alot of my plate ever since I can remember I just dont know how to control the stress anymore and it's causing serious medical issues with my body. I just need some advice on maybe how to help the whole tension headache situation while im waiting to be seen with that. I'd also like some help with how to adjust to all these new things.
thanks guys!
