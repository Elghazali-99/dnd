I've been dealing with really bad symptoms from my BPD and depression, I'm sixteen, and my parents wont get me any help for it. I have a hard time making friends, and my stepmom is making me feel like it''s all my fault, like there's something wrong with me. I already have a low self esteem and she's making it so much worse. I just don't know what to do anymore, I don't know how to handle it. I talked to the school counselors once but they didn't help one bit. They don't even care, just nod and ask questions without any empathy at all.
 She's saying if I don't start having sleepovers and girl moments with friends that I won't be allowed to see my boyfriend anymore. I hardly have any friends, let alone ones that are girls. She's saying how he's making a big negative impact on me and blah blah. How he hates his family (which he does for good reason) and how he's making me hate my family. I see him three days out of seven, and she's still saying that's too much. He's made a better impact on me than she'll ever know. I've tried to reach out to them before, but they've denied me. I don't know what to do. I just feel like I'm never good enough, and I'll never be. They don't understand. I feel so messed up. What do I do? My mom isn't around, so I can't go and talk to her. I'm just so tired of everything.
 I guess this was really more of a vent session, but how can I cope? I've been cutting on and off since the seventh grade. My parents think I've stopped, but I won't tell them since they humiliated me last time they found out. I'm overwhelmed.
