Im 16 and for a long time in my life everyone in my environment have treated me like i am not human.I am quiet and don't really brother others and once in a while I talk to some of them in class.They tease me a lot telling me that Im a man some don't like me or jealous me I don't know what it is but for English class when I say my answers say something bad about me or tease me.And now my so called best friend is a back stabler she jealous me so she want nothing to do with me aloe I help her when she did not have.And its test time for me so I mistaken lost a girl calculator and now she want to beat me up and the people in the class think that Im weak so them can take advantage of me.The teachers could care less.I did not do anything to anyone so why this is happening to me.I don't want to cuse oh act something that Im not.At home my dad don't respect me .He never want to listen to me and when I try to speak he think that im rude.And even a work they think that im stupid,that im dump cause I dont cuse and the pay master dont want to pay me she always want to take advantage of me.I told the boss but he dont care.Sigh what to do.
