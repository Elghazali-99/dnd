My sister has BPD, I'm convinced and has all the signs:  eating disorder, impulsive spending, uncontrolable rage at times, peppered with sentimental feelings, instable relationships, impulsive (she married two men she barely knew, one after 8 weeks and the other the first time she met him), instability at her professional job, she lost two jobs for refusing to do what her bosses asked her to do and for angry outbursts with them and others in the building, disconnect with her children (although she loves them) her preoccupation with herself gets in her way of caring for them properly.........and she's been on antidepression medication all her life....
 My question - with parents and siblings that do not want to name this thing and my parents who are emeshed with her and refuse to stop enabling her emotionally and physically how do I set boundries for my self.  My mother is the worst and I simply cannot be around when the two of them are together.  It's as if NO ONE else is important and she has to "support" her daughter (of course this is at the expense of the rest of us because my mother is simply obsessed with my ailing sister).  All of their time, love, attention, finances, and loyalty is drained by my sister.  How do I have a relationship with them?  How do I set boundries when we only see eachother around holidays no, we are grown.  I am at the point of no contact with this sister.  Advise?
