I am 40 years old and I am in my second round of menopause (I think). I had a hysterectomy at the age of 30, but everything removed at the age of 34. I had hot flashes then and they lasted about a year. This past winter the hot flashes came back worse than anything I have ever experienced. Over the last three weeks, any type of physical activity that I do (walking, shopping, washing the car, watering flowers outside, etc.) I get very lightheaded to the point where I have passed out. This past weekend, I went into a store to make a quick purchase and I passed out. I was in the store for approximately 15 minutes. I wasn't "out" long, but it was embarrassing. I was covered in sweat and it wasn't that hot outside (about 70 degrees, I live in Ohio). I know it isn't my heart as I just had a heart cath done on May 1st and everything was fine (no blockages). 
Is this just menopause at it's worst, or is something else going on? I am a diabetic, but my numbers are normal (my normal). My BP has also been normal. The only thing not normal is this constant sweating, hot flashes, passing out oh and my extreme exhaustion. 
Has anyone experienced anything like this that could lend some answers for me. I see my doctor on July 10th. He's on vacation right now, and the other doctors in the practice just tell me to go to the ER (which is a waste of time). 
 Thanks in advance for any feedback!!
