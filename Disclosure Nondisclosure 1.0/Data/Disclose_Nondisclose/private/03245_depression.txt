I do not know when depression started.
It is something I am not sure about.
The idea of killing myself wanders in my mind years now.
I always thought I am a lower being and I let others control my life.
But it happend in such an extend that it ruined a lot in me.
Because the people I trusted were not good people..
Lately I am thinking to suicide again.
I have images in my mind of me taking pills, or cutting my wrists, or even stabbing my heart with a knife.
To be honest I would do it if I did not thought that there are some people that would really miss me.
I can stay still in a place for hours without even moving, thinking about various things and not noticing what happens around me.
Head aches became more often and I do not know how to fight this numb feeling in me.
I feel that people are worried for me yet I deny to accept the fact I must feel something again.
If I had one wish for me and me only, it would be to die without any of the people I know to be hurt.
I am egoist I know...but isn't depression an egoistic feeling on its own?
