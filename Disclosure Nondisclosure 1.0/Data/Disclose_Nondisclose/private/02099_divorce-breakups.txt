I'm stuck, My marriage is over, my husbands a selfish pig who can't even get home in time to take my son to his basketball game, I have chronic pain from a back injury and have just been told 2 more years of pain till I'm better.
I do everything, pay the bills do the shopping, pick kids up drop them of, clean the house ,cut the roses ...I have been working 22 hours a week but the doctor has just cut be back to 10 per week, I have income insurance, but we have two homes one is empty and on the market we owe the bank $650,000.00 dollars I can't pay the bills and my husband just expects me to do everything. I can ask him to take his car to work so he can help with sports and kids (4 of them) but he forgets, I can ask him to put the rubbish out but he forgets, these things then fall back onto me, and if I don't do it ... it doesn't get done, the rubbish builds up the washing builds up, the weeds grow he just watchers tv, yes we have been to councillors, I can't leave because if I go before the empty house sells he will sell it for a song and I have worked so hard for so long I can't do that, how do I make it day to day with a man for has left me on the floor in pain with our son on the phone begging him to come home, and he says work finishes in 45 minutes I'll come home then, how do I live with this man who has sex with me even when I have tears streaming down my face and are so drugged up I just let him because its easier than the fight and the mess he makes when he's angry...  and yes I don't have alot of respect for my self right now but I dream of the time when I can have my own little place just me and the children...I need the money I'm owed to take care of my children. what can I do to make it.....
