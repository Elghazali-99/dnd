Dear Doctor,
About 6 weeks ago my right elbow and right knee joints started to hurt. Didn't think much about it. 2 weeks later during my business trip which included several hrs of airport delays, I suddenly got this strange pain in both of my hips, both my shoulders and continuing with the elbow, then both wrist and fingure and jaw joints.  The pain would worsen when I would get up after a period of sitting down, in an air conditioned room, and during my sleep.  From being called a pretzel due to my body flexibility, now I can't change my cloth or walk staight without hurting. To add to the problem 4 weeks later, I also developed tingling feelings in all my fingers, and hands. It would get so sleepy and hot that would wake me up at night. I am a 49 yr old female who is behind the computer 10 hours a day with a very stressful work. The noticeable changes in the past 2 months have been that at work we moved to a very bad air quality location with lots of draft.  Also, after 3 years of taking BC pills I decided to stop it and see if I will become menauposal. I did start getting hot flashes 3 weeks later and just got the result of blood work to confirm my menopause.  So far, I have seen an orthopedic Doc, a gynocologist, an Neurologist and now waiting for a Rheumotologist appt. No one able to tell me anything. A suspect for Novovirus and Lyme are considered. However, I have no rashes, no flu like symptons and no fatigue. Also, I would think that RhumotoArthritus would not suddenly hit a healthy person this way?!  I am sure several more blood work will be done. However, is it all possible that these joints pain are due to a drop of hormone and body reaction to the change??? Most doctors may not support that concept.  I have read similar questions in your section but from young male. My noutrition has always been good. I have become even more health conscious since my pain started. Please help me to narrow down this if you have known of similar cases! thank you
