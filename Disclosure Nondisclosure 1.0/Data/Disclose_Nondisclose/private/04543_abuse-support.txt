I am 21 years old and going on 22 this month. I have been through quite a bit in my life and I really need to vent and feel like people care...here it goes. My biological father was a womanizer and has 9 kids from 5 women, all close in age with me. He walked out of my life when I was very young and never came back. My stepfather came into the picture shortly after and molested me as a child from age 2-11. Not only did he molest me but his best friend tried to rape me on numerous occasions. I was lucky enough to get away each time but each time things went further and further. For a long time I was so scarred that I hated men, all men. I became a lesbian for about 5 years, and was very promiscuous with females. I then decided to try and give guys another try. In doing so I had a total of about 4 boyfriends. Each and every one of them either cheated on me or left me because I was not ready to lose my virginity after everything i had been thru. When I finally found someone I cared about, I decided to give him my virginity. He was perfect at first then began being extremely emotionally and verbally abusive. He knows my past and that I am a very quiet person because of everything I've been thru and at times I feel he takes advantage of knowing these things. Things got better for awhile after I pretty much had an emotional breakdown and told him things had to change or I had to move on. We eventually got married. Now that we are married I feel somewhat confused. He has been calling me names and treating me bad once again. Please help...idk what to do anymore. If possible go to my profile and message me.
