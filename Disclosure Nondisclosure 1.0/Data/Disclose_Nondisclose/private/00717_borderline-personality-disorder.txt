I have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder 5 years back when i fell into depression and took a mixture of xanax and ecstasy and tried to commit suicide by jumping off a roof of a building. Luckily a friend grabbed me before i jumped.  And i thought after i was released from the metroplex pavilion that maybe the doctor was wrong because i felt fine and thought maybe it was a effect of the drugs mixing together or something. As time progressed i noticed that this pattern of irregular behavior and drug abuse was just getting worse then before and before i knew it i landed myself in jail and from there things continued to get worse. I was sentenced to 5 years probation and thought maybe i could get myself back on track but I was wrong. I still noticed these irregular patterns of behavior and i got more into drug and alcohol abuse and more and more problems came alone. I became increasingly violent with people, feeling like people dont care about me, etc. Now i just recently took interest in my diagnosis with BPD since i do notice the symptoms in myself. (there is a lot more to just this above i just wanted to fill you in a little so you can get a ideal of what i am talking about) and I am afraid of what might happen to me because i noticed these symptoms are becoming stronger in my life and i'm starting to push people away from me again without even noticing. Please I don't have insurance so i can't go to a doctor to get help and i really don't know what to do. I do consider myself depressed and i do have suicidal thoughts constantly. I just don't know where to go for help or what to do and I want to get this under control so i can have a better life with my son and my family. thanks
