Ive been very depressed over what is about to become my 2nd divorce in less than ten years, and Im not even thirty years old yet. I dont know if I should look into any therapy or medication, or if it will pass, but these past few months Ive found myself feeling increasingly lonely and anxious. I spent much of the holidays just chain smoking alone at my apartment, feeling devastated and empty. 
 My first marriage was just a passionate mess, I was too young and foolish, and it just wasnt meant to be. I was still 19 when I first married, and had not yet turned 21 before the divorce was final. I was angry about it back then, but never really got depressed the way I am now. 
 This 2nd divorce is different, because I was older when I got re-married at 26, and had just gotten out of law school. I thought I had everything so much more together and that I had found the man I would spend the rest of my life with. I couldnt have been more wrong. I found out last October that he had been cheating on me with another woman and that was it. He moved out before Thanksgiving, and I guess I've just been in shock for several months, caught in a downward spiral of depression while waiting to get all the legal paperwork finalized. 
 Going to court when you are a young lawyer, still learning the practice is hard enough. Going to court to represent yourself in your own divorce proceeding like I have to do tomorrow is absolutely nerve wracking. Im just a total wreck right now, smoking one cigarette after the other all day and about to need to start on my third pack already, its so awful. To be only 28 and divorced twice makes me feel like there must be something wrong with me. 
 How do other people go through this?
