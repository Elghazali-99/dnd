I was prescribed Remeron for help with weight gain and anxiety. I gained plenty of weight with this medicine, but haven't felt like it does any good with my anxiety or depression. Prior to starting Remeron, I had NO trouble falling asleep without any assistance. When I tried stopping Remeron (after taking 7.5 mg/night), it was fine for a few days but after that I had the most terrible time sleeping. I would lay there awake, but not really functioning, for 6+ hours at night. As if this isn't frustrating enough, I went to a different doc for a second opinion, and he said Remeron is just for sleep, not even depression or anxiety... I told him about the insomnia issue, and he said it shouldn't have anything to do with stopping the Remeron, since it is NON-HABIT FORMING. I find this very questionable since I had no trouble sleeping prior to this medicine. I feel like ever since starting Remeron, things have been very unstable. Now I can't tell if it's the medicine, or just me. I don't want to be on medicine long-term but now I feel like if I stop, the withdrawal will make it too difficult to function. Any advice would be appreciated.
