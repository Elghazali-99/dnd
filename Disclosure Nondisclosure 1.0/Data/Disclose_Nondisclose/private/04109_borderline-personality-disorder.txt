I am a 21 year old married, mother of two. 
  I was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago. I also have anxiety, and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. 
  I've been trying new medications with my doctor and nothing seems to help.
  I am currently on Xanax, Pristiq, Nuvigil, Seroquel, and Depakote. I was on Zoloft for about 6 months, and it didn't seem to help at all. 
   The help I need is what to do with my children. I've felt so hopeless and numb lately that I've been neglecting my kids. I stay at home with them in the daytime. Of course I feed them, bathe, change, etc... but when it comes to actually interacting- I have no energy or interest. I'll read books, and color- but I can't find the strength to go in our backyard and play. I get angry very easily with them. I do NOT harm them, but I think about it all the time. I know I would never actually do anything horrible like that. Once in a while I'll spank my 3 year old. Mind you, I am an anti-spanker. My husband says he understands, but he really doesn't understand how bad this is getting.
 I'm on all of these medications because of my kids. I want to be the mom they deserve. 
   Is there ANY advice you can give me about medications and what will give me my life back? Thank you.
