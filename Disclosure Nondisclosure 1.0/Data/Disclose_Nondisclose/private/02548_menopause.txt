A few months ago I was helping my daughter move and while lifting I felt something funny in my vagina but kinda shrugged it off because I was to busy to worry about it at the time...after getting home and getting into the shower I thought about what happen and I investigated and I felt a bulge in my vagina....freaking out I called my Mom and she said it was probably just my uterus or something dropping down and to stop lifting. This was around June July this year..during this time I have been on an emotional roller coaster with personal issues my stress level on a scale of 1-10 was a 20. I was sick all the time with stress barely eating. Around end of Aug or beginnig of September I got vaginal spotting...it lasted a few days and then nothing for a week maybe more and then it would happen again maybe for a day and then nothing ..its just been very light spotting on and off ,like now its been four days , never enough to be seen on clothes or anything and always saw it after going to the bathroom....I did go to the Dr...upon her exam she did a pap test and a vaginal exam and said she felt nothing abnormal but that my uterus was slightly enlarged and I had a slight bladder and bowel prolapse. Due to the spotting she told the receptionist to set me  up for an ultrasound and a vaginal one if needed.I thought for sure after the exam I would come home and have all kinds of spotting going on but there was nothing for almost a week then I had some this past Friday....what I want to know is with all the info I just gave is there a chance I can have uterine cancer or some other type....I didn't know if prolapse can cause spotting or stress ....I tried to talk to my Dr before I left the office and she just said she would talk to me after all results were in so that has left me really scared. I have my ultra sound tomorrow and then my Dr appt is not till the first week of December. I am going to be really sick between now and then with stress and worry about this.
