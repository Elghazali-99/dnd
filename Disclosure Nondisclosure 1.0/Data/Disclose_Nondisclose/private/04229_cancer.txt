may 2014, I noticed two small, pimple like bumps on the back of my knee. They looked like a pimple with a white head, ready to pop. After time I realized they weren't pimples..they wouldn't go away. I would knick them shaving and they would bleed sometimes so I decided to shave around them. I remember worrying but not too worried. Fast forward to the fall and they raised up, hard to explain but they itched after a long while of developing into bigger bumps. The bigger one I itched and it bled and oozed pus. Since then, I've put off getting it checked out. I, sorta scared but I'm also broke. I'm booking am appointment with the clinic this week. Right now it is at a weird stage where it bled and oozed and now is "normal". It's raised, itched, popped and oozed in the same exact spot anoit several times now. Here's a pic of the stage I'm in now. Where it tries to heal over itself. Please, any idea what this is. Skin
 cancer seems so tricky as there are tons of different kinds. Thank you in advance for your time and advice. :)
Guess I can't post w pic:; will try to later on laptop!
