I am sure you guys get these alot, buut I would like advice frrom peeople who actually have it. I have these nightmares all the time with the same monster/demon in it. Theyy always seem so real, but i never had a problem till last summer. Last summer i started to see it when I was awake. It is always their for a few seconds then it is gone. I don't see it everyday, but once I do see it, I see it for the rest of the day all the time. two of my worst instances, with it my mother came in the room to wake me up, and when I rolled  over and saw her She looked just like that monster so I punched her. The other is when I was staying at my girlfriends house, I was awake and I saaw it climb on my bed and laugh and crawl inside my girlfriend, It tooll everythingn in me not to attack my girlfriend, so I compromised and stayed up all night and watched her sleep. I do not have intense hallucinations like that very often but when I do they are horrible. Also over the years my life has been falling apart. I use to be a strait A student, now I flunk out of college and I can neever concentrate It always seems like other things are grabbing my attention. I could be anything like i want to go fishing, i need to buy donughts, no i need to workout, or maybe i should play videogames. I bounce from one job to the next. I have also noticed My emotions slowly dying. I don't feel hardly at all anymore. I am not sad, and I still laugh at things I just don't feel empathy or remorse anymore.If you gys could help me out I would appreciate it.
