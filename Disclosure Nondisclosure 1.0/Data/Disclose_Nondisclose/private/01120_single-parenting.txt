Hi.  I am a single mother of 3 teens.  18, 16 1/2, and 13.  My 18yr old recently became pregnant, not married and last week broke up with her boyfriend.  She still lives with me.  She has a part time job and is very reliable there.  At home, she rarely helps with daily chores, her room is constantly a mess.  She uses my bathroom/shower to get ready.  Often uses my makeup, has left curling irons on on the carpet to the point where burn marks are visible.  She wears my clothes, even my underwear!!! (yuck i know).  She rarely does her own laundry, hence wearing my clothes.  I pay for her car insurance, her cell phone, and was paying for her car until she got into some trouble with a friend in Jan and I let my son start driving the car now.  So, she often takes my car to work, has only helped with gas maybe twice since Jan.  
 I want to be a supportive mother and help her with living, and when the baby comes, but She completely takes advantage of me and my home.  When she was in high school, graduating was the most important thing and so i never pressed the issue of her paying for her own phone, or car insurance.  I know my poor choices have not taught her to be responsible, so I am not blaming her completely-but she knows right from wrong.  My own parents were very poor role models, both alcoholics-so I pretty much raised myself and have no guidance as to how to teach my kids to 'live'.
 Can anyone share some advice on how to ease into teaching her some resposibility?  She is a little over a month pregnant and she needs to realize how much her life is going to change, and that mommy isn't going to bail her out of this one!
