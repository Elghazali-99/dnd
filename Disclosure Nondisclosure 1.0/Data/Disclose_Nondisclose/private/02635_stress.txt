So around the middle of may, I started experiencing symptoms that I recognise as burnout (there is another possibility for what's going on, but I don't want to get bogged down addressing that).  I finished the school year okay (it was my senior year in college), but I've been out of school for more than a month and I'm still short on energy and having trouble doing things.  Every site I look at talks about taking time off in terms of a couple of weeks, but then, this hasn't exactly been time off, because while I am much less busy than during the school year, I am babysitting full time (it's a low maintenance kid, so it's not a lot of stress, but still) and preparing to move to another state in about a month.  On the other hand, I'm worried about giving myself too much time off because I know that can be just as bad as taking too little. So my question is, how long is this supposed to take?  When might I expect to start feeling better, and at what point, if I don't, should I force myself to start doing things again anyway?  (Assuming that point is before the beginning of September when I start grad school).
