Basically about 3 months ago I was smoking a for only about five nights in a row and I didn't have that much to be honest. I smoked it a little bit the year before on and off and had one panic attack. Going back three months I had a pretty bad panic attack i was with my friends (I never smoked alone) it only lasted maybe 10 minutes and I was fine. I sat up then went to bed but I when I woke up I noticed everything looked kinda blurry and 'plastic' in a way and eventually I realised it was derealization I was suffering from and not long after I noticed I felt like a robot and was getting panic attacks and depressed and so on. Now a days it has calmed down a bit but one thing really bothers me I don't know wat it is but I get old memories pop into my head and they bring upon a feeling of dread and distract me from my current state of mind. I looked it up and I think I have mind pops, I also have an unclear view on the world now. For example I can think of future or past events positively and they are a blur and indifferent to my old thoughts I don't know wat to do. Please help
