On the weekend I did something I didn’t think I was even capable of. I pushed my ex-girlfriend and had no memory of doing it as I was very intoxicated and only found out about my actions later threw mutual friends. What if I had of done worse and assaulted her?
I am very disappointed in myself and have since sunk into depression. I obviously have some angry feelings toward her although she was never unfaithful and didn’t do any wrong by me she just frustrated me at times which hurt my feelings. I was reading an article that explained how we can’t control others and when they don’t act or do how we think they should we get frustrated.
 She has moved on very quickly and has a new boyfriend now. In past breakups I have taken a long time to get over them.
My mother has told me I was angry as a child. So I’m thinking I have an underlying issue such as my father not being there for me which could be a cause for this anger. I have caused myself unnecessary suffering from this and need to try and forgive myself for my actions and at the same time get over her and forgive her for hurting my feelings. Where do I start?
