Am so stressed out. My job is starting to get to me. They are looking for any reason to fire people. Not enough work. So they say when in reality there is. No OverTime but, yet they make us stay pass our shift. And we have to cut it by leaveing early before time goes in. Which put us under more stress to get our work done before we leave to cut overtime. If we don't cut the O.T. we get writen up!!! If we don't get our work done so we can leave to cut O.T. we get writen up. They are going over my work behind my back and telling me that am not putting out all my stuff  out! How they do it and how I do are 2 different things. They just cram all that stuff on the shelves and it looks so messy and bad!!  And I am putting all my stuff out!! Thats what makes me so mad! They just pi$$ me off so bad! You ask them questions and they act like we owe you no explanation. You know with the way things are people are going to crumble under thier rules and do everything to keep their jobs!! Its so sad that if you don't have a job you envey people who do and if you do your at the mercy and abuse of  an employer like this. Sorry to vent am just very nervous. How should I handle this? Am try to compley to the rules. The worse thing is I make good money and I know I won't find this kind of pay again. What do you suggest I do?
