Hey there, I have an urgent question to ask. A little less than a month ago, my girlfriend and I had a bit of fun. She had just gotten off her period around 4 or 5 days before that, so we decided to have a go at fingering. Lately her period has been freaky (all over the place, no equal intervals). So anyways, we were in my bed and one thing led to another, and she started giving me a handjob. I had precum on the head, and I remember touching the precum, and remembering not to finger her, just to be safe, but in the heat of the moment I forgot and fingered her. Probably a minute or so passed in between the time when I had precum on my fingers, and when I fingered her, so it could have been wiped off. Also, I had to pull her pants down because they were still on so it probably got wiped off on her pants too, but I'm still worried. It's almost a month later, and her period hasn't started. She's been having abnormal lengths in between them, but not like this. It's usually shorter intervals, rather then almost 35 days. Now, my question is, could she be pregnant? We're both 15 almost 16, we're both virgins, and we're both freaking out. She's had PMS symptoms that could also be pregnancy symptoms, like cramps, light headedness, and she's been hungry (she doesn't usually eat lunch at school so that could be why). Also, she's been feeling nauseous so I've been worried about morning sickness, but she hasn't puked at all. Please give me all the advice you can, we're both scared half to death, we don't need a child on the way, we're both straight A students and we don't need a baby to hold us back. Thank you.
