I have now been with spouse several years and more and more believe he is bpd after reading stories posted on internet.  His emotions are very yo-yo and temper is explosive at the drop of a hat.  He never got very physically abusive with me until I was 7 and1/2 months pregnant...very verbally abusive though.  He drug me down the hallway by hair in front of his son and hit me.  Things are always my fault because I think I am "perfect"...far from that.  However...the yo-yo effect has gotten worse again and my son is now old enough that it effects him.  When daddy does not get his way...things get verbally abusive and then leads to him kicking me out of the house and then threatening suicide if I don't come back.  How am I suppose to help support my husband in getting help when he thinks nothing is wrong with him and keep my son safe?  Right now I let him come visit whenever he wants...but this is now not enough for him...but he has not taken me to court yet?  I've been told I have enough evidence that he would never get him alone...I am terrified for my toddler!
