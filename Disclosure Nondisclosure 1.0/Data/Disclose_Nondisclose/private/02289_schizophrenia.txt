for along time now ive been having weird symptoms of something that I think is a mental disorder or maybe something else im not sure ..... I constantly daydream I don't talk to myself out loud but I do in my head I will pretend like im someone else or someone famous or someone that everyone likes . I don't hear voices other then the ones I create in my own mind and I control what they say kinda like thinking to yourself . but Ive done this ever sense I was a little boy but now its a constant thing .. I would say it has an effect on my social life but I used to just sit in my room all day long with my headphones on a listen to music while daydreaming sometimes I will even make hand movement. when im walking down the street I daydream even when im in a room full of people I will still do it doesnt effect my ability to talk to people . I heard what I have could be this thing called maladaptive daydreaming . I also have a fear of going out in public and bumping into people I haven't seen in a while because I think they will judge me or think im  loser i also sometimes daydream while walking around my backyard . but again i don't hear voices and i don't see things either . i also have noticed that my speech has gotten a little weird as well i quit often will be talking then i will start stuttering for a second like having trouble getting what i want to say out . or i can be explaining something and cant find the right words it will take me a second to get it all out  do you think i could be a schzophrenic
