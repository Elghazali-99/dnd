i am a virgin. a penis has come in contact with my vagina for less than a second. he wiped it with his hand before the run in happened. right afterwards i wiped off. no penetration occurred. WHY AM I FREAKING OUT?
 it happened a month ago on the last day of my period. i have very irregular periods and hardly ever get them because of my weight. lately i think i have been so nervous about the posibility of being pregnant that i am putting false symptoms into my head. i feel slight cramps, my boobs are sore, bloating some days, ive been pooping more than usual since around saturday, and since yesterday ive been peeing more. i think this is because i have been pushing on my uterus (and probably bladder) to see if its hard to see if a babys there. its been a light yellow which isnt my normal color. crazy right?! im thinking its just pms or extreme anxiety.
 can someone please calm my nerves or tell me if theyre going through the same thing?
anything at all would be helpful to calm me down.
