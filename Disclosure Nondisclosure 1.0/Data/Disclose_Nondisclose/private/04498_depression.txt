Hello, 
Not exactly sure what i'm looking for here...  I'm worried that i've contracted herpes from a girl 3 months ago. Been to countless doctors trying to find answers, but it seems like it continues to get dismissed as no big deal and no answers have come up as of yet. 
 I stepped outside my relationship with the girl I love, for a stupid drunken one night stand with some random person, and am having a hard time coping with the guilt and the regret which I am feeling. Guess part of me thinks I deserve this life sentence, but its sapped me of all my confidence and self-respect.
 I lost my father to suicide a few years back, and his father had passed the same way. I'm starting to believe its my destiny to follow in their footsteps, as I don't know how to live with myself after this. That situation, in combination with the pot I started smoking following his death, sapped me of my ability to cope as a normal person would.
 I find myself wishing for a way out more and more each day. One of the main issues thats holding me back is my mother, who has always said if I was to do that to her she would follow right behind me. I can't bring myself to put her through the pain which we've already suffered, but don't know how to carry on with the shame i'm currently feeling. I know theres no answers which can fix the problem... I guess I just thought i'd share my story.
