I had 3 teeth removed3 days before easter.  my front top teeth.  I did not hurt the first day.  but the 3 and 4th day I was hurting  my gums and lip was swelling I was having to take 2 pain pills to get relief.  my niece is mad because I did not want to come down there and have easter with them.  she was going to her boyfriends mother house she does not like us and we do not like her.  why would I want to go some where I am unwanted and hurting.  they never even bothered to ask how I was doing.  I get my bridge put in on the 29th.  I started whitning my bottom teeth tonight.  but I still have to use pain meds.  the day I had my teeth removed before my niece that lives with me had to go to see her doctor. and they argued.  then I have to go and have plasters of my top teeth and a plaster of my bottom teeth for a cleaning tray to fit in.  this is the first easter out grandson has not been with us.  either one of them.  she said her car was in the shop.  he has a car.  they went to the coast I know it is working. and they are getting along. if she wants to be mean do it when I am not hurting.  mandy876
