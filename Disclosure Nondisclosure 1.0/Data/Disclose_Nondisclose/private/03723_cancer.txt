I am now 18 but had been chronically constipated since I was about 15. I would only dedicate about once every week to 2 weeks. About 4 months ago I started to notice little bright red streaks of blood in my stool. So I assumed hemorrhoids. I decided I would try to cure myself of my chronic constipation, so I took a couple of laxatives. Almost within a week I started having regular bowel movements and they grew smaller because I wasn't pushing 2 weeks of stool out. But still the blood remained, bright red streaks. It was at this time I would start to feel dull severe pain in my tail bone. The pain in my tailbone pain would come on after I eat and right before I had to defecate. After I defecated my tailbone pain would go away. Also if I exercised my tailbone pain would get more severe, or if I flexed my sphincter. But the pain would go away throughout the day and return. After about a month of having blood in my stool, I started to see white mucus form on the stool along with the red blood streaks. The stool would sometimes have mucus, blood, or both. It was entirely random. A month I only notice blood in my stool if I have to force out my stool. Also in the past month, sometimes when I fart some clear mucus comes out. That still happens every once in a while, but lately I haven't noticed any blood in my stool. The mucus is still there, and the tailbone pain is still there. I don't have long pencil stools, I don't have abdominal pain or bloating, I don't have weakness or fatigue, i dont know anybody in my family who has had it, But I am still worried I have the big C. My bowel movements come about once a day or 2 and the beginning of the stool is little pebbles, then is followed by a short regular width stool. But the toilet bowl is filled with brown liquid and mucus..
