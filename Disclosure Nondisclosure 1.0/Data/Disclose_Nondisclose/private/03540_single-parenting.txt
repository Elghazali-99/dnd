Hi, I just had a baby with a man that i was not marry to nor in a relationship with.  The baby is 2 months now.  I know I made a BIG mistake.  However, the baby is here now.  I met him because I work with this guy's father.  We took a paternity test because he wanted to be sure (I was sure), test came back that is the father.  He told his family about it all.  Most people told him that he should did this and could've did this.  But it is too late for that. 
 But when he told his dad, the man that I work with, he said that I TARGETED his son.  This hurt me soooo bad that I got upset and burst into tears. We got into an argument and his son said NOTHING to defend me.  
  He does not know how much I didn't want another child ( I have 1 daughter Already).  He said that I asked for his son's number, he did not ask for mine.  He said you liked my son, he never said that he liked you.  (Yes, I asked for his son number, but was not planning to have a relationship with him, especially NOt Get preganant).  I made 3 appointments to the abortion clinic and could not bring myself to abort the baby.  I am upset at both of them.  I am not sure what I should do.  We work together and he did not attempt to apologize to me (I WOULD NOT ACCEPT IT ANYWAY).  
 Please someone give me advice and say something to help me through this.   
 PS: When i told his son that  was pregnant (at 2 weeks pregnant)  He did nothing to support me, the whole nine months I had no support from the his son and yet he said nothing to his son about that.
