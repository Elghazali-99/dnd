I'm a 19 year old who is getting ready to enter into college for a second year. I have recently over the past year developed severe depression while at college most likely due to the fact that I felt lonely because I had no friends. After graduating from high school I now only have one really great friend and an amazing boyfriend who have done their very best to be there for me in my darkest days even though they went to different colleges. I hoped coming home for summer break would help but the depression is still there no matter what I try to do. I am so scared that I am going to push away the very few people who are still friends with me. Any suggestions on what may help before I lost everyone I care about? I am at the point where all I want to do is sit and cry because the depression is so bad and I'm so scared to lose them. Nothing seems to help anymore and I feel like I'm depressed all the time now and I don't have any good days. Nothing can seem to get me out of this slump. It would be great if someone who has been through something like this can give me some advice.
