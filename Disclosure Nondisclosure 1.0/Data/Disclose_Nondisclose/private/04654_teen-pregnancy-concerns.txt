Five weeks ago I had sex without a condom but it only lasted a few minutes and he didn't go in far because it was my first time after a few very short minutes I made him not because we didn't have a condom he never cummed, even after he was out. the next week we had sex and used a condom then a few weeks ago I can't remember when might have been the next weekend, we did it again and we used a condom and starting that month I had been back on my birth control pills and had been using them very well every night around the same time. so on Tuesday thanksgiving week we had sex and we did it for a long time and I actually when very far and everything because it didn't hurt anymore and we used a condom and I was on my pills very well still, and he pulled out and cummed when he was out (he pulls out and then does it every time) so then the past weekend I took my last birth control pill on Saturday and I usually always start on that Sunday the day after but this time I didn't start , instead I've gotten a thick white discharge but I've gotten some small cramps from her and there and a head ache and some acne which is usually all I get for symptoms when I'm on my period so I feel like I was on it but there's no blood just white discharge and one night some brownish discharge, I took a pregnancy test 3 days after the day I was suppose to start my period (Sunday) I took this Tuesday and it was negative and I've had no pregnancy symptoms but I still haven't gotten my period and I usually do, also the month before last around the first time we had sex I messed up my pills bad and had to stop so I ended up getting my period after the first time we had sex but because it was messed up I was still bleeding while taking the new pill packet because I always start a new packet on Sunday's. so I'm not sure if that has to do with it or idk but it's almost been 5 weeks since the first time w didn't use a condom and I had my period after that all the other times we've had a condom and he's pulled out so I'm so confused and upset all the time now and I'm not 5 days late today with white discharge can somebody please help me.
