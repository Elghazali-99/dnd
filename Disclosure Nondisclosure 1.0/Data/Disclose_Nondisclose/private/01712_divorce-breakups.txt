so im sure everyone hears the same thing over and over again... but i need help/advice.... I have been with my husband for 2years known each other for 9 years... we have 2 children together (5 and 1) but im just now opening my eyes to the pain an hurt he has caused me now and over the years... let me give you alittle background a little over 2 years ago before we got married i made the mistake by cheating on him. he stuck with me tho called me really bad names treated me like crap. i stuck it out trying to keep our family together.. well last year, i was 9 months pregnant. on our 1yr wedding anniversary he wanted to go party an walk the track, i wanted to go home. the night resulted in him beating me up and 2 days later leaving me for another girl.. 2months go by an hes calling me saying he messed up wanting to have our family back, i fell for it while he made all these promises we did get back together i helped him thru a legal bind he ended up getting into while we were seperated.. now for the past 6 months i have been living thru emotional and verbal abuse an seldomly physical. he constantly tells me im a bad mom and treats me like a child, parties on the weekend instead of spending time as a family (he say i keep him prisoner but he has no job or money an he wants to spend my money on seeing his friends than payin bills) still has yet to fill those promises like he said a year ago &&i have very few friends bcz of him and half of my family wont talk to me bcz of him... im finally opening my eyes to whats going on, an i want out but im afraid he'll take the kids from me... my mom said i was able to go back to her house but i have to do everything myself. [ex: get conseling, restraining order, divorce ect.] is there any other advice i can get to make my transition safe and easy? (mind you he has no idea im planning to leave him, just going to pack up an move on.) 
any thoughts, advice, help would be appreciated!
thank you
