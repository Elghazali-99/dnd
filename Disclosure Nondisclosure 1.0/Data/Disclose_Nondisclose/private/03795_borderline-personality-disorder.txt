Hi my name is laura im 25 and i got alot of question about bipolar. 
I was diagnosed with bipolar II  3 years ago when i finally hit rock bottom. 
I now take 800mg of lithium 60mg of citalpram my mood is stable most of the time till sometimes i get really scared, lonely and panicy especially when im at work or out shopping i never want to talk to people and always walk with my head down hoping people wont notice me. 
I also have an angry issue i can snap at any moment and i imagine hurting that person.I also experience days when i have no feels for anyone or anything i mean i didnt cry why my nan died i didnt feel anything just blank? 
I get parnoid that people are talking about me and i can feel myself getting really mad so anrgy i want to hit that person
I also have no sex drive at all but then when naughty i want to sleep with ramdon people either women.. 
I know im not a nasty person and i would like to think i would never hurt anyone. 
Do i really have bipolar? do i have bpd?
Or is there something really wrong? 
can anyone help?
