I'm a 32 year old male with depression, anxiety, and paranoia. The worst of it is the anxiety/social anxiety. Well, the other two are "almost" equally as bad. I have tried most of the benzos and SSRI's with little success. They screwed me up pretty good and I am still suffering from withdrawal a year out. Are there any other options for these two conditions other than benzos and SSRIs? I'll try anything that will take the edge off...in the least bit. 
 I often feel like a 52 year old man in a mid life crisis, it is so bad sometimes. The problem is, I don't really have any goals in my life. I can barely leave the house sometimes the anxiety/paranoia is so bad. Honestly, all I ever wanted to do in life is to experience sex (with a woman) which I did a few years ago a number of times (whoever invented online dating is a godsend!). I could not die without losing my virginity. I just couldn't! Now, if I had to go, I could go. It (sex) was nice, but I can live without it. As for the other things that most people want aka material goods, I have driven fancy cars and rented mansions...but never owned them. Like sex, I can live without those as well. I have a good, supporting family and a decent job at the moment. I fear everyday for my future. I don't want to go off the deep end like so many others have done in the past. I just want to be healed and live a normal, decent life.
