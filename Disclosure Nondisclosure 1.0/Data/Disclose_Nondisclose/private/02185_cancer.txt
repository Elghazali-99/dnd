Hello, I was diagnosed with CLL (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia) about two years ago. I started chemo January of this year (2015) because of a bad stomach problem and my white count rose to 185 within 9 months.  I've finished chemo, in September but my white count stays between 2.3 to 3.2.  I'm alway tired and cold like I'm in a meat locker.  I'm weak and have all over body pain.  I also have fibromyalgia.  I'm 48 years old.  My red count is 12, my platelets have been  between 245 to 315, which is good.  In October I started feeling really bad, chills fever of 100 to 102.  Felt like I was trying to catch the flu but never did.  My doctor gave me so antibiotics, which helped but they did a chest x-ray and CT scan and found a nodule on my lung.  I'm scheduled for a Pet Scan in 2 weeks and I'm scared because they say it might be Lymphoma.  I'm starting to notice more chest pains, harder to catch my breath like I've been running.  I guess it was there before but I thought it was because of the all over body pain.  I had a CT scan in March of this year (2015) during chemo and nothing showed on the scan.  I have 3 young adult children, 24, 20, 19 and they know but support from them isn't really great.  I'm a Veteran and I do have a therapist I see weekly but I'm still scared because I don't know what's going on know.  Any suggestions?
