This is from a loving father who cares for his son's well being. My son is 19 years old and spends all, and I mean all, of his free time on the computer playing games and chatting with friends, all who happen to be male. My son, over the past 5 years or so has become very withdrawn and doesn't seem to have much self esteem. 2 nights ago he came to me and announced that he was "gay". After the initial shock I asked if he was in fact gay or thought he was gay. He stated he was gay, although he had never had sexual contact with another male. He told me he had "thoughts" and figured that would make him homosexual. My wife and I both told him we loved him very much whether he is in fact gay, or just questioning his sexuality. I did find out he has been talking online for sometime with a gentleman who is gay and is telling my son all kinds of sad stories about losing his boyfriend. My son is a very caring person and would show his caring even in a chat room to someone he has never met. My question is; "How have other teens dealt with these issues, especially depression and questioning their own sexuality?" I truley do not believe he is gay, but has been influenced by the individual he has been chatting with. If he is gay I can accept it, but I do not want him making a mistake that could harm his future well being. 
 Thank you all who respond. 
Dad
