37 yr. old female. Last year I was found  to have an elevated Kappa/Lamda ratio in my urine. A repeat test was done to confirm, and the elevation in the ratio increased. A third test showed not only an elevation in the ratio, but an elevation in Kappa as well.  I don't have those lab report. My last lab showed a elevated K/L ratio of 16.84 reference range is 2.04-10.37.  My Kappa was elevated at  79.00 with reference range 1.35-24.19, and my lmada was normal at 4.69 reference range .24-6.66. 
 I have no Free Light Chains in my blood on repeat testing, and no M-spike.
 A bone marrow biopsy was essentialy normal-
"Normalocelluar marrow with trileage hematopoiesis
Non specific thickened lamellar bone trabeculae
Mildy increased polyclonal plama cells (7%)
Iron stores (1+/4)
No significant reticulin
Blasts not increased (1%)
JAK2 Not detected
BCR/ABLE not detected.
 I also had a normal kidney biopsy.
I have had an elevated WBC for 6 years, I run anywhere between 12,000 and 25,000.
 My hematologist said the Bence Jones in my urine is idopathic and not a cause for concern. Is this something that should be tested on a regular basis? Is there something other than cancer that can cause this, or is there a cancer that can cause this that would not show up on a BM biopsy? My concern is that over 6 months, my levels increased. Thanks for your time!
