My daughter who is gifted and went thru elem school with straight As.  Started middle school at a gifted magnet school and still make  all As except in math where she got Bs.  Halfway through 6th grade she either refused to go to or would call me right after being dropped off. Made it thru that yr but 7th started badly and I withdrew her and had her put in hospital/homebound where a teacher comes to our home twice a week.  She received all As in homebound.
Almost two weeks ago she started at high school and went one day, refused to go two days and went the next two days.  This second week has been the same so far.  Says no problems in class just stressed before going to 1st class.  I had to pick her up day.  She sees a psychiatrist,therapist and attends group therapy and all have told me to take all internet access away.  She is total anti-social and says she socializes on the internet.  We have not had problems with boys, sneaking out, drugs, alcohol.  As of today I have completely cut off all internet, video games, phone.  I have given her 5 days to try it again (all the professionals have told her and me she needs to break though and find coping mechanics.  does this seem to make sense?  I have given her 5 days to make a decision before  i withdraw her and put her in virtual school.  any comments, opinions appreciated
