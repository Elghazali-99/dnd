I am very depressed and scared of the depression I may face. I am in danger of losint my eye. I go to see a specialsit in Dallas on Friday.
I think the fourth doctor involved in my retinal detachment has neglected me, just like the other 3. I am astounded and furious that he has done so. He told me not to come back for 6 months, but I wnet back in two weeks. I saw another doctor because he was in surgery, and we discovered what has been going on with my eye. The current doctor was not payung much attention. I got in this predicament because my opthalmologist neglected my condition. The the first retina doctor was abusive, I did not understand because I have been traumatized by all this. 
 My brothers and sisters abused me as a child, and now thery are still mean to me. I will never tell them if it happens. They will make fun of me.My daughter is in Dallas, and I have not even told her, because she has her own issues, and she would tell my sister, 
Crazy world, right?
 I have little support. I have a therapist, and one friend. And the couseling help line at the university. 
 I am planning to join a group soon, if I do not have another surgery.
 I will have reconstructive surgery, if I lose my eye.
