It was way back in 2005 when I started having a lot of itching on my skin and around my genital area in particular. This made my think that I might have contrated one of the STI deceases and I went to different doctors for test. I got tested of HIV and Syphilis and the results tend out to be negative. These tests were again repeated a couple of months later and the results showed nothing again. What came when the itching stopped was the burning sensation under the skin and this has been with me till now. In 2007, I went to hospital again and the same tests were proposed by a doctor and the results were negative again.
 I also find it necessary to tell how this burning sensation happens and how it is affecting me. when I am alone the problem seems to be worse than when I am among the other people. When I  wake up I do not feel the burning but after a  couple of minutes the burning comes up and mostly around the abdoment. Sometimes, I feel some burning and itching right on  the very top part of my head. Headache is so common!
I want to say that I have noted I big difference in me now and the me before 2005, I do not concentrate on my studies anymore because of this and most of the times I get tempted of dropping out of school because this problem has taken so long time and it is not getting any solution.
Your help is highly appreciated here.
Thanks,
Tiwili.
