I am 14 years old, and I was adopted when I was 4. I sometimes do think about killing myself. I'm a Christian girl and I don't understand why life is so complicated. My mom is trying to figure out how to make me happy but there are so many things I want to tell her but I can't. I just don't want to get hurt. I keep trying to tell her that I am so mean to other people because when I get close to someone they always die. OR they bully me and hurt me. Either way I always getting hurt. Sometimes I wonder why everyone leave me. Why do they leave me? When I'm mad it's not kinda mad I'm really mad. When I'm Happy I'm not kinda happy I'm really super happy. When I'm sad I'm like super sad. Random things make me sad though. I don't want to get close to other people because they just leave me in the dark. I don't like the dark... :( This is the only way to get my thoughts out without lashing out at someone. And nobody will know who this is anyway. I feel like every time something bad happens it's always my fault. When people get mad at me I can never figure out what I did wrong. It feels like there mad for no reason at all. I'm sometimes not sure if I should even be alive. I have tried killing myself before but I couldn't do it. I just can't bring myself to hurting myself. That's God keeping his hand on me. Anyway. Why do I feel such things? What's wrong with me?
