Hi, I had a completely hysterectomy back in October of 2012. Everything out, ovaries, everything. 
 I was immediately thrown into severe post surgical menopause. It has been a struggle. The very bad symptoms like hot flashes and sweating are actually much better. However, I am still getting skin issues, insomnia, dryness, and a few other things. 
 I have always had eye floaters or for at least 15 years. However, they have gotten excessively worse since menopause. I have gone to literally four different Opthamologists (same group) for these floaters because they keep getting worse! I have been reassured that I do not have retinal detachment or anything like that. The last exam was July 3rd. The Opthamologist actually told me he has heard many menopausal women complaining of this symptom. He cannot tell me why this is the case, only that he hears this story all the time. He can tell me that most women will say it either gets better and calms down after about a year or they learn to not notice it as well.
 I am getting so many floaters right in my field of vision. I never had it this bad and it seems to be getting worse!
 Has anyone else battled this, too?
