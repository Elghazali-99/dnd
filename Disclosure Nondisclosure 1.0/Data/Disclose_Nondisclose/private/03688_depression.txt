Hi all. Thanks for any advice or suggestions, really appreciated, I think this website is wonderful. 
I was on Celexa 20 mg for a year, and quit it cold turkey in December. Had some dizziness from doing that, but felt okay otherwise. Until a few weeks later...which my doctor said wasn't withdrawl because it would be out of my system, but just how I feel being off an antidepressant period. Anyways, I started having bad anxiety. I believe I have always had a degree of anxiety, but able to cope with it, this past month and a half has been awful with my anxiety. I am a 27 y/o female. I started having left shoulder blade pain, which my DR said was muscle tension from being so anxious. Then I left for vacation, went on a cruise, and on the cruise started having fleeting random pains in my left elbow, wrist, and a couple of the fingers. So I got VERY anxious and scared, thinking it was my heart, went to the medical center, got an EKG, it was normal. They gave me a few Flexeril for muscle spasms, and sent me on my way to enjoy rest of vacation. The random pains still lingered, but not as frequent or as bad..and the shoulder blade pain seemed to have went away. CONTINUED BELOW, CUT OFF SORRY SO LONG
