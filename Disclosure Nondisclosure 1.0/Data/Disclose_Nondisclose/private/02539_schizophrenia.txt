my daughter is being treated for schizophrenia symptom for three years. She was on Resperidone 2mg at night and 1mg in the morning for quite some time as her symptoms improved she was put to resperidone 1mg gradually. She stopped taking medicine in the month of october for 12 days. Her condition deteriorated. She was given resperidone 2mg in the morning & 1mg at night. On 7th November she was diagnosed with pancreatitis. Her medicine was reduced/  She is currently on Risperidone 1 mg at night. She has developed one new symptom that she laughs without any apparent cause at any time. She has become stubborn in her behavior. She doesn't take interest in any activity. She becomes aggressive if persist to do something which she doesn't want to do. She sit idles all the day. It seems she isn't watching TV though she seems to be. She is 29 & a post graduate. For few days she seems to be forgetting events which happened a moment earlier. She says she can't be cure & should be left with a nurse. She knows that I am facing financial hardships for quite sometimes. I suspect that she has develop sleep problem also & lies hours in bed under a sheet. Though her pancreatitis is under control.
