Hi, I was hoping maybe someone here can shed some light on the craziness of menopause.  I was thrown into menopause by chemotherapy a year ago (breast cancer).  I don't many hot flashes and rarely have night sweats like "normal women" do. Instead, I get high blood pressure when lying down. Mostly at night, sometimes in the day if I take a nap, but as long as I'm horizontal, my BP goes up. Drives me insane, keeps me up many nights a week. I've talked with others, researched online, been to doctors. No one says this is a typical menopause symptom, yet no one can find any other explanation other than menopause.  I didn't have  normal periomenopause into menopause transition. I got here almost overnight with chemo.  I also have Hasimoto's which is stabilizing now that I've dropped gluten. But the high BP at night, oy!  It comes with some shakiness, jitteriness and I have to get up go sit in a chair, just get  vertical.  Very destructive to my sleep pattern. Any ideas?  Is this really due to hormones??
