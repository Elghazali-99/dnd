I have a 69 yo MIL and we're having issues. She has been a widow for 14 years this year and refuses to get on with her life. This would be fine but in doing so she causes tons of trouble for her children and can be manipulative, insulting and downright difficult. 
 Her troubles began around menopause (before she lost her husband) and more recently she seems to be acting out as different kinds of personalities. We have her normal personality, we have a new age personality, we have a venerable, childlike anxiety ridden personality and then we have the one that I'm most concerned about ( a woman that appears and is positively nasty).
  When MIL is in the nasty phase she dresses differently, holds herself and gestures differently and even her whole face appears to change. If we take her somewhere in this phase she verbally abuses strangers, uses inappropriate language and attempts to say shocking and salacious things in front of her grandchildren.
 When the nasty phase is over (can last up to a couple of days) after she's picked fights with everyone, upset everyone, she claims not to know what she has done or said and claims we are making things up and are out to get her.
 The nasty personality is overtly sexual, vain, combative, destructive and cold as hell. We are concerned because she's driven everyone away from her, has hurt those who are left and then two thirds of the time she's incredibly venerable and we don't know what to do.
 Has anyone experienced anything like this??? If so what should I google, any suggestions as to who we should see?
 TIA
