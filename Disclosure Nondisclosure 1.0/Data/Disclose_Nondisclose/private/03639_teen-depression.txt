So lately I have felt really down. My self esteem used to be decent before I moved to a new school back in October. All of the girls on my team are absolutely gorgeous and it makes me feel really insecure. I was bullied back at my old school (it closed) so I was pretty insecure already. After a while, I made a bunch of friends and everyone likes me. But the thing is, I feel as if I secretly annoy everyone and that they all hate my guts. Another thing is, all of the stunning girls compliment me on my looks, but it is really hard for me to believe them. I have tried to force myself to think that way. And if I am so gorgeous and nice, why don't my crushes ever like me back? Ever since I was a child, I was that loser who never had any guys like her. When I transferred to my new school, I had a crush on this one guy when I first got there and he acted like he liked me but he would always date other girls. :( And now I like this other guy and he always looks at me but he never talks to me and I am afraid that he hates me. I am really starting to make myself miserable. Whenever I look in the mirror, I see a fat and hideous beast staring back at me. I am also afraid that no one will love me because I am too weird and annoying and crazy. :(
