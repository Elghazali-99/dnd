I live with my aunt and cousin. My aunt is in her early 70's and my cousin is in her mid 50's. And my cousin slapped me last Sunday night. She hit me like I was a man. I'm 26. It's not the first time she's put her hands on me, but she kept trying to attack me that night. She is slightly mentally handicapped, but she knows right from wrong and is very street smart. She steals my things and threatened to spit in my food in the refrigerator. She also leaves mean and nasty voice messages on my phone, gives strange men my phone number, and tells them to call me. I can't change my phone number because that will cause conflict in the household. I pretty much hide in my room when my cousin is here unless I really have to leave my room for something. (More to the story, but this is what happened lately.)
 I am also bullied by my other family member about my sickness (longer story). I don't know what to do. I love my family, but I knew it was a bad idea to move back home when I first began to get sick. I've been back for a year now, and it's just gotten worse.
 I am agoraphobic, monophobic, have anxiety and panic disorder. I have a small income, but it's not enough to just up an leave. I don't want to tell other family members that I want to leave or ask for help because I am afraid that I will be kicked out with nowhere to go. Any help or advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
