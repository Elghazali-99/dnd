in June 2014, I had my last period, or so i thought...it had been a year befor that since my prior period but dr did bloodwork which showed i was in menopause and woud have "few or no more periods"
  well just this Oct 30, 2015 while i was on vacation, i said to my husband that i was feeling moody, had a headache and sore boobs..i told him if i didnt know any better i would think i was getting my period..well a few days later, i got it with some bad cramps and nausea, feeling full ..never had cramps before !!
  Went to doctor and did a transvaginal ultra sound..they did see a small, simple cyst on left ovary...but doctor doesnt think that shoulld have caused the periods, and told me after 17 months, there should be no activiy in ovaries ..he said thats not good and ordered a D and C which i have to go for this monday the 23 of november..
   I have to be honest i am a serious basket case over this, fearing its cancer
Doctor suspects a polyp, but i swear it felt more like a period ..even had pimples!!!
    Anyone have any input as im a wreck...
thanks in advance...
