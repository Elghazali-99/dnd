My husband and I were married for 15 1/2 years, together for 20.  We have been seperated for a year.  This was my husbands choice, he claims he's never loved me and has never been happy.  We have two little boys ages 4 and 7.   The first 13 years of our marriage was good at least I thought so.   We were very fortunate to have none of the normal issues that cause strife within marraiges....(money, in-laws, religious issues, addictions etc.)  After the birth of our second son, my husband got emotionally involved with a female co-worker who had been diagnosed with cancer.  He claims it never went beyond a friendship but I did catch him lying to me about different issues.  At that time we went to marriage counseling 4 times and things seemed to get back on track, it was actually my husbands decision to stop going to counseling.  He changed jobs and no longer had contact with the co-worker in question.  For the next year and a half, things were great, we seemed to be closer than we had since the birth of our children.  We went on vacation for 10 days to celebrate our 15 annivesary.  A few l months after returning from our trip, I noticed my husband withdrawing.  At that time he said he just wasn't happy and didn't know why.  He moved out of our home into an apartment, that was a year ago.  He will not work on the marriage, go to counseling etc.He has not filed for divorce.    I am having a difficult time accepting all of this and moving on.  Any insights would be appreciated.
