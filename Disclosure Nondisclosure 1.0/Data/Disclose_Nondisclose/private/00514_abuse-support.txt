My daughter, who will be 5 in a couple months and in Pre-Kindergarten.  Last year, August 2006, I recieved full custody of my daughter and my ex-wife recieved only supervised visits a couple Saturdays a month.  There were no visits until March 2007.   During that time, my fiance became "Mama" to my daughter.  This was not pushed by me, my fiance, or our families.  This came from my daughter one night.  She had replaced my ex-wife on her own and found my fiance to be the kind of woman that she wanted in her life.  
 In March, my ex-wife decided to act upon her visitation schedule and see my daughter.  The first visit lasted 4 hours and after those 4 hours, my daughter had recessed from the previous 8 months that my ex had not been in her life.  During this visit, my ex told my daughter that she was going to take her from me and my fiance at a grocery store for her to live w/ my ex forever.    This disturbed me and my fiance.  Two weeks later, my ex saw her again.   Two weeks after that, when my daughter saw her play therapist, it came out that my ex had told my daughter that she was "going to kill her and herself so that they could be in heaven forever."  
 This disturbed me, as it would anyone, to the point where I violated the court order and got a protective order for my daughter against my ex-wife.  She then didn't see her for another 4 1/2 months.  A judge granted her a chance to continue supervised visits and she did for one visit on August 18th.  Since then, she has cancelled one visit and didn't show up to another one on Sept. 8th.  
 What kind of emotional damage or psychological damage could come from the actions of my ex-wife toward my daughter?
