My mother died last year from stage 4 breast Cancer. she had it before and it was stage2 about 15years ago. she had a routine check up constently. she went in with some pains in her hip, problems breathing, and she was having problems with her throat. they gave her all kinds of diagnoses until she went to a bone doctor and he put some dye in her back and found the cause which was stage four cancer. she died 5 mths later at 67yrs old. before that she had been diagnosed with diabetes, fybromyalgia, sjogrene syndrome, high blood preasure, conjestive heart failure,osteoperosis,tonsillitous, Gerd, hytial hernia, Anxiety(which is certainly understandable)and anything else you could possibly imagine. she took around fourty damn pills a day for about 25 yrs including pain meds. My father was diagnosed with diabetes, parkinsons, demensia, Gerd, depression and a couple of others that i cant possibly keep up with because its ridiculous. anyways, without the doctors consint i removed some of my fathers meds like the parkinsons and demensia and a few others that wernt related to his heart or vital organs and he is like a brand new man. Well isn't that something? to bad its illegal to go and slap the snot out of the doctors head. my down syndrome brother went in for surgery to have his gallbladder removed. guess what? he didn't have one. they removed it 22yrs ago but my mother was dieing and could not remember and at that time my father was too druged up to know his own name. you would think that sinse it was the same doctor who removed it 22yrs ago that he would have my brothers file sitting in front of him. nope!  So in saying all that, i guess you could say i have an anger problem because there is nothing legally, that i can do to make it right sense any law suit on a doctor goes in front of a panel of doctors tosay if it is worthy of a law suit. How ironic is that?
 Ok, doc. what kind of meds do you think i need for my little problem!!!!
