Hi all, and before anything I apologize for the length. I'm just looking for answers.
 I've been with G (what I'll call him during the post) for numerous years now. I knew about his high school induced low self-esteem prior to dating him. Aside from me thinking it was wrong that he felt inferior and ugly, his self-esteem issues never seemed to openly plague his or our life. [Some background: he went to a 99.9% Caucasian private catholic high school. He of course is Filipino. He had "friends" but he never felt that he belonged. He was socially awkward and for a majority of the time there very overweight. He blamed his lack of acceptance on him being ugly. After he transferred out prior to his last year he began going to the and since then has been avid about working out. He puts on weight/muscle very easily and constantly gets asked what he takes (eluding to steroids, which I can confirm eh does not take) by random people at the gym and stores even!] About a year ago we were discussing people we know and how good looking or not they were. He asked what I thought of him (I told him he was hot) and then asked if society would think so as well, to which I said yes again. Ever since then we've been having cycles of problems. To save paragraphs of information, I'll simply list one of his "cycles"
 - He feels inadequate, and craves attention (stares, check-outs) of attractive females, to which I point out for him. If he does not get the right attention, or enough of it,  he becomes disheartened and angry. He then turns to me and asks what happen? I said he was hot, so why did he not get attention? And continues to question my claims of his "hotness"...
- He claims that I was wrong, that I lied, and/or that my views are untrue. There is no gray area, only black and white. If you're hot you get hot girls checking you out, hang out with hot people, and get I guess you could say perks that only hot people get. 
- Sometimes, if bad enough, he becomes extremely angry and says that I screwed up his life by ever telling him he was hot because I am unable to "prove it" to "his standards" (which may I add are the ONLY standards because according to him he has "studied" hot people at his high school and knows what hot people get). He gets mad that he could ever even believe that he was somewhat good looking. He blames any attention on his physique alone. It has gotten to the point where he has made suicidal threats. However, his family ties are even deeper than his issues and (as he has stated before) he could never do that to his parents. He mainly uses them as a way to make me feel guilty stating that it would be up to me to tell his family why he took his life, etc. 
- Once the anger subsides and the name-calling, yelling, and belittling ceases, he calms and says that he is sorry for what he says, that he is just hurt, that he hates how he feels, and so on.
 These cycles last for a few hours usually, and happen maybe once a week sometimes more sometimes less often. Afterwards he returns to his normal self (which by the way is perfect, and he would be perfect if he stayed that way consistently) and sometimes even has good days where he feels good about himself.
 What I've said so far is only a sliver of insight on everything, however I think it gets the point across well enough. He feels inferior and at times worthless, there is not middle ground only black and white, he can easily go from one emotional extreme to the other, and is prone to small anger outbursts depending on how stable his mood is.
 I'm planning on seeing a counselor myself to discuss him. But I'd greatly appreciate input, thoughts, feelings, etc. 
 I know some would say to leave, but I can't. He's like this maybe 10% of the time (and yes I will admit, during. afterwards, and when I think of those times I can't help but want to get away) and he is, at the core, a good person and does not deserve to have to feel this way about himself.
