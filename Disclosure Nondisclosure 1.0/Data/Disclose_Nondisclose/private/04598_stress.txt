hello i suffer with deppresion so my doctor says any way and ive been on and off medication on and of  for 20 years know. at first i suffered horrible thoughts like my dad was going to die and my mind told me to touch a door handle or part of the wall 3 times i did this and my mind would rest from the fact that he was going to be ok. and stop the thoughts so the day was always easier to get throu the other thing i used to do was when he was leaving for work  in his car in the morning was to jump out of bed run to the window and look at him going down the rd and i had to do this three times. and if i missed him life was **** i would be touching things alday  from white lines in the rd to picking up fag ends and broken glass rubbish and putting it all in my pocket and takeing it home. and i had to thro it al in my garden to know he would be ok.that was the start of it i dont have these anymore but i worry if my dauther goes out shopping with her mum or shes at freinds. i like to keep an eye on her and know where she is i think its only natural. of a father to worry like that. its the fact of her being on her own looking for her mum and she cant find her just pictureing her face makes me tence and really stresses me out life at the moment gets to me i always feel guilty if i go out i think it makes my wife mad and i think it does.i go deep with every thing i do my whole body just ackes and i have loads of pain in my neck and shoulders and muscle spasm the doctor says its all part of deppession ?
