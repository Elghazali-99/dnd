Life is a bit tough at the moment and it seems to be getting worst. I was feeling really down today. and I've been feeling off. People talk to me but I just can't help but wonder off in my mind, and have difficult focusing on the conversation. I thought I was tired since that's what everyone kept saying. But I've been sleeping fine. Today I was feeling even more so down then ever cause all my problems kept replaying in my mind. My body felt heavy, and it was difficult for me to move. I forced myself anyways and got to the kitchen when I started crying. I suddenly felt even more heavy but I ignored it. And then I started feeling ill. And then dizzy. And then my right arm went numb, like I couldn't use it. The rest of my body felt odd. I just stood there until I could walk. My arm still felt tingly and I still feel sick. I can't focus on my work or anything. And my food habits are going up and down.. I don't know what's wrong. I keep thinking bad thoughts and I just can't help it. Please don't tell me I'm PMSing or hormonal or whatever. I'm not either one. I don't know what is wrong but I don't feel right. What do I do?
