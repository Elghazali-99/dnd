I have had an addiction to Lortab for a little over a year now, and in the last 3 months it has got very bad. I have a two year, who i gave birth to at 17. I stay at home all day with him, besides on Tuesdays and Thursdays when i go to school (in which, i am about to graduate with a associates in early child care development). My mother was addicted to crack my whole life, along with my grandfather, and who ever my step father was at the time. I am still happily with the father to my child, and he knows about my addiction, but i don't think he understands the severity of it and i do. I promised my self, and SWORE to myself that i would NEVER EVER allow myself to become addicted to anything for my child, but i have, and it is making me very depressed. I have found a friend who gets a drug called "suborxine" (not really sure on the spelling). But it is for people fighting pain pill addictions. We have no insurance at all, and we are labeled "low-income." I NEED to go to a detox/rehab program or talk to a counselor but i can't b/c i cannot pay for it. Does anyone have any suggestions? Anything would be awesome since i have nothing right now. Also, I have been having terrible pains in my kidneys... is this normal for pain pill addiction? Thank you, and BTW-- this is the first ime i have used this forum.
