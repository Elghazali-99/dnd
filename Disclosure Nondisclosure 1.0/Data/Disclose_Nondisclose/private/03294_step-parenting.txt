Lately I feel as though I'm completely at the end of my rope. My stepdaughter is 6 years old and absolutely spoiled rotten by my husband and her mother. I believe that they are in a way competing for her affection. This, however, has turned her into a complete nightmare to be around. Shes rude, steals, lies, ignores, the whole nine yards. I understand that she's 6 years old, but to me "she's just a kid" is in no way an excuse. I feel as though this is the age in which she's learning the most. If she does wrong, do something about it. My husband does not believe in chastising (sp?) His daughter though. Her acting this way is a fairly new trait also since she's stared spending time with her mother.  To make things worse she's so possesive of my husband the 2 of us cannot have a conversation without her being leeched on to him or scratching outside of our bedroom door. There is absolutely no privacy or personal space in my home at all. This particularly has me worried because we are now expecting our first child together and have yet to let his daughter know. I have nightmares of her causing physical harm to the baby once he is born. Honestly at this point I wouldn't put it past her.  Im worried abiut when this babu comes that i will treat them differently. I dont know if i can or will love them the same. I dont want to play favorites, but sometimes i find it hard to even tolerate his daughter right now. And i had to already tell my husband that i dont want our child to be raise the same way that they raised her. I know my hormones are crazy right now, but I also know her behavior is not normal.  I've spoke with his family about the situation and they all see it as a problem in the future as well... I guess I just needed to vent a little bit, maybe see if anyone has a similar situation.
