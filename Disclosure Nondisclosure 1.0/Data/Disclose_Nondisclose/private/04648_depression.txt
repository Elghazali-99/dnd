I am not bipolar, depressed or schizophrenic. I am weaning off Diazepam & zopiclone. Due to many health problems of late, & an unpleasant event occurring on top of all this, I have been rather anxious,because of all this. My question is:
What & how will Olanzapine help me with these circumstances occurring all at once? I am very reluctant to add yet another medication to those I'm already on. I'm also on Oxycontin 20mg & 30mg, Oxycodone 5mg twice daiy or prn, codeine 30mg  with paracetemol 500mg 4 daily, 3 anti-deps - mirtazapine 30mg twice daily, nortriptyline 10mg at night, & zoloft 25mg (supposed to take 50mg, but found that dose made me ill), Gabapentin 600mg 3 times daily plus the above mentioned ones I'm weaning off. Dosages are: diazepam 5mg 3 times daily, plus 2.5 daily, zopiclone 7.5mg twice daily. The psych I see for medications, has prescribed Olanzapine now. I do not want to take this, as it will just be yet another med I'll have to wean off from eventually. Can you please advise me in how this med could possibly be indicated for me, just because I've been a little anxious, which I'm handling by natural remedies and my faith In God to see me through? Thank you.
