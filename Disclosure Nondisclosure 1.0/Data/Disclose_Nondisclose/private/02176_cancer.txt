I have a hard, "jelly bean sized", firm, non-movable lump on left side of my sternum, right between my breasts.  I've had no injury to the area, it is not discolored & have had this bump for a couple of years.  During a mammogram a couple years ago, a "marker" was placed over this area, however the marker moves with my skin, and since the lump is fixed on my sternum, it doesn't show in a mammography.  They said that they "didn't see anything near the marker" in the mammo., however it was not able to be "pulled" into the mammogram.  (I hope you understand what i mean by that.)   It is slightly tender when it's first palpated, but is painful afterwards.  It does not change with respirations at all.  I have had brain surgeries, so that has taken precedence, but sometimes this lump gets very tender and seems more prominent.  I don't want to dismiss it if it shouldn't be, as my father passed away @ 53 yrs old from small cell lung cancer.  Also, it doesn't change size with ibuprophen.  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!
