Hi
I'm 18 years old and got some problems. I think I might have some kind of identity crisis or brain disease.
I feel quite empty all the time, sometimes I don't feel like I am person at all, well it's very difficult to explain,
but I don't really have a feeling "personal sameness and continuity" (found that phrase at wikipedia).
It kind of feels like my brain activity decreases a little day by day, it's been going on for like 2 years or something.
 I'm not a very social person, I have a few friends at college, but I spend most of my free time at home by myself or my family. I'm a very silent person when I'm with people, not so much with my family, but with others, not because I don't have the courage to speak, I'm just to "empty" inside to have anything to say almost all the time.
 I'm not what you would call a totally emotionally dead person, I do feel joy, for example when I'm at football games and my team scores or wins, or some anger if I die in a xbox game :) etc, but I have to say I'm a little emotionally numb, for example I wish I were more worried when my grandpa is in the hospital or stuff like that.
 Any help or advice is very appreciated, if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask.
Thank you
