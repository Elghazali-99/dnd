So, I've been having terrible mood swings for over a year, like within hours. One minute I'm fine and the next I just want to die not actually die just no longer exist anymore, then within a few hours I'm fine. this doesn't happen everyday just most days. sometimes I feel it about to happen and unsuccessfully try and stop it. Hugs help honestly so I ask coworker's usually for hugs. Which doesn't help if I'm at home or at the store or driving. Sometimes they don't help at all, they just delay the inevitable. I hate feeling the downs because they effect my job in the service industry. Some day's I have blackout where ill do something for like an hour or two and not remember anything from those hours.   I have highs as well were I cant stop moving or ill talk so fast that ill get words mixed up like ill know what I'm saying but when they come out they come out wrong. My friends notice my change in moods but I honestly have no clue on how to stop them I try counting taking a brake, listening to music but I can never seem to avoid them they just delay them and when they happen I just become the copilot. Any ideas on how I can manage them or what it might be.
