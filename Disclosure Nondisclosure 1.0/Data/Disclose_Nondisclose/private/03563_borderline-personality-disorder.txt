PLEASE, PLEASE HELP ME.M<y daughter, 42,single has become worse over last few months. The supportive family we have are now all washing their hands. I am the only one who is trying to hang on in there even though I am screamed at, verbaly abused and they are now telling me it's all my fault! I hate what she does but as a mother can't remove myself from her. I am al she has. I know that ther is a very frightened person underneath all that rubbish and she is sick. They all agree she is sick but would not remove themselves if she had a broken leg. My younger daughter tells me to hang on to my own health and step back for a few weeks. That will be one more abandonment but is it the right thing to do?  Please advise. She's started to lie, become very evasive and her money just disappears. She's never been any good with money how ever much we have all tried to help. Worst thing, she refuses to admit that there is anything wrong with her.
Does not drink or take drugs, have asked her closest male friend who is a recovering alcoholic. He says he's sure she's not on drugs and never drinks. He is as puzzled as the rest of us about this acceleration of unreasonable behaviour. She stayed with him and his girl friend for a week and he is no nearer to finding out what she does with her cash than we are.
She's just moved into a lovely flat, which we all made possible for her, and she insists she loves it there. Please tell me how to handle this, it's affecting my relationships with everyone because I won't leave her to drown. What do I do?
