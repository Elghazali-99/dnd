My husband own property, which he tooks on his own. He never to took single ruppe from his parents for porperty. Currently me and my hsuband residing in same house. His parents wants to come and stay with us. We sperated from his parents because his mom and sis used to do lot of polictics and game. they use to tell different things to me and my husband and inturns we used to have fights in between us. but somehow my husband trusted me and he realize his mom's politics and agreed to stay separate from them. 
My question is whether they forcefully come and stay with us ?? My father in law also have house which they have given to theri daughter. My mother in law everymonth takes 30 to 50K from my husband as an expenditure. Does she has any right on his salary ?? As a wife can i decide on how much salary to be given to his mom and also about his propoerty can i make decisions?? Is there any legal provision in india? My husband have two elder sister and both are married. As per Hindu adoption and maintainance Act 1956 - it requires hindu sons and daughters to maintain their elderly parents when parents are unable to maintained by themselves. It means my husband only need not to take whole responsibility of his parents right !!. As a wife what are my rights on his salary and property ??
