I've been married 20 years. I have two boys under the age of 11. When we married, I knew my husband drank beer, however, I had been around it all of my life at a small degree and considered it acceptable in my early 20s. I learned about the AA "frog in the boiling water" story and realized it was me. For the past 2-3 years he passes out on the couch before 9pm. When I go on a business trip, his insecurity level rises and its a constant fight. He hit our son last summer and gave him a black eye - and I accepted it as I had never seen it before. I told my son if anyone asks, to just make something up. This year his job was in jeopardy and he began to lash out. A couple months ago I'd had enough and asked him what he wanted. He blew up. He called me names I didn't even know existed. He told me he would kill me, even though I had never heard him speak like that, it terrified me. My kids heard the whole thing. For a month I walked around like a zombie, trying to figure out what to do. Trying to weigh the 20 years and not knowing how this all came about, until I rejected an advance from him. He left and came back several hours later, completely intoxicated and very verbally abusive. I had to call for family help. In the meantime I had an escape for my kids, if he ever did this again. They were ready at the drop of a hat to crawl through the window when I signaled, and run to a family member. It didn't come to that, but it was there and they were ready. That night the kids and I left. The next morning I took them to school. And my husband called. He played the trump card. He admitted he was an alcoholic and was going for help. And he did. He went to a few meetings, he's in an apartment, he's dropped 20+ pounds, he looks pitiful, and he wants me back. He wants his life back. I can't give it. I filed for a divorce the same week I left. But he's wearing me down. I tell people not to judge me until they've walked a mile in my shoes. Advice would be so helpful. Thank you.
