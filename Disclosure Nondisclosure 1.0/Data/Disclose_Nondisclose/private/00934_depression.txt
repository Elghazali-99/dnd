Hello.  Been a long time since posted last here.  Was going through a really rough patch last spring.  Had a good summer.  That time of year where its getting cold and dark.  That dark cloud is trying to make its way back in my life.  
 Been taking Wellbutrin for 5 or 6 months with some limited success.  I dont take it consistently though--I'm terrible about that as I just dont want to accept I may need to take antidepressants--gotta do things my way.  Anyone else feel the same way.
 Anyway, the dr I see (who is really quite outstanding and been a life saver for me) mentioned that maybe we should try Abilify as an adjunct to Wellbutrin.  Guess this is one of the approved uses for this drug.  I had thought it was only for bi-polar (which I am not).  I'm scared to take that step, to get on a slippery slope of taking more than one or multiple drugs.  I can barely accept and acknowledge I need one.   I have read some success stories though and may be willing to at least give it a go (if my insurance will cover it?).  
 Was wondering if anyone here has taken Abilify and had success.  I really dont want to focus on the negative or listen to horror stories.  I'm sure they are out there.  I need some positive feedback.
 Hope all is well with everyone here.  Seems like there are quite a few really great folks here.
