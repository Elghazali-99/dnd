Hi, I've been off birth control over 3 months now and had been having regular periods. very normal. Well I had a normal period 7 days then I had unprotected sex with my husband atleast 6 times throughout the week and he finished in me every time. And I believe I should have been ovulating that whole week, I'm not sure. but anyways, exactly a week later (2 weeks before next period) I have brown discharge which turned from pink to brown to tan repeatedly for a good 6 days then on the seventh day it turned to light light bleeding, that I whole day I was nauseous and never ever felt the cramp i felt, it lasted atleast a whole 24hrs straight just a big cramp sitting in my stomach, I just KNOW something isn't right.T And for the next 3 days I spotted and on the 9the day there was just discharge with tiny tiny specks of blood in it every now and then.. I amexperiencing EXTREMREEEEEEEEEEE fatigue .. I have never ever just been so lazy and wanted to sleep so much. Walking outside for a little just drains me! But it is now Tuesday, the day my period should have regularly came and I have boy signs of it except I am SEVERELY BLOATED, I've been bloated before and when I wake up it's gone but now itstays there. eating just one small thing blows me up to look 4 months preg. It's so uncomfortable, I just go straight to sleep. I get extremely nauseous if i wake up during the night. Sorry for the book but I wanted to give all details lol. I'm trying to give my period the rest of the week to come to be certain that i actually missed it after these 9 days of discharge and spotting even though I have a gutt feeling it's not coming (; *sorry to post again but I wanted to post a pic of my bloating
