Im 18 years old. im normally a bubbly, chatty and energetic person but at the moment i dont know what to do. i live with my boyfriend and we have been together for 2 years and before that were bestfriends for 5 years. I have always had to deal with seperation in my life, my mum and dad split up when i was 2 and for 8 years was not allowed to know him, i still dont know why to this day. i still never get to see him as he lives quite a while away with my little brother whos just turned 7, who again i hardly get to see. my mum remarried when i was about 10 and then they split up when i was about 15. My mum and my boyfriend had a falling out on new years eve this year and their not talking, im not allowed to talk about them to one another. Im in a dead end job as a sales advisor and at the moment am on the verge of loosing my job, when my boyfriend is unemployed and we are living off my wage of like 350 a month. he's not around as much as he used to, hes to busy off with his friends and he'd rather spend his time with this other girl and his friends than me. im scared to text him or anything because i got screwed at last time of being 'too clingy'. I feel like everything i do is wrong and i cant make any one happy these days. over the past 2 months i have spent every day crying and thinking of different ways to end it all. i cant talk to my mum and i cant talk to my boyfriend. i miss who i was and i cant find my self again. im constantly feeling ill and down and my other half says its because im down he doesnt want to spend time with me. but the only thing that makes me happy these days is being with him. ive lost all my friends when i left school, so i have no one. and im so tired of having nothing to come home to but an empty house, and constantly worring about money. i dont know what to do anymore, i just want this all to stop!
