My wife has been on Zoloft since before we met in 1998.  Her short term memory is terrible.  She doesn't remember something that happened yesterday until I remind her of almost all the details, and sometimes she remembers things differently, forgetting important details forever.  I don't mean this in a judgmental way - but she has become very insensitive to other adults around her.  Emotionally insensitive, like others are not supposed to have any feelings at all, while hers on the other hand are important.  She sleeps 12 hours a day and still takes naps.  No energy.  No libido. Her facial expressions show strongly feelings of anger, disapproval, etc., but she denies them, and tells me and the rest of her family to ignore the feelings we're "supposedly" seeing play across her face that she is unaware of.  Her answer to anyone who challenges her about anything is "just don't worry about it", or "that's just the way I am".  We both have been through extensive therapy for child abuse issues, yet she seems to have forgotten everything she learned in therapy.  Dealing with her is often very confusing, as her arguments follow no logical pattern (don't follow some of the usual rules of logic and discussion).  It's a lot like dealing with a drunk person, without the slurring of words.
     I have tried to show her information about side effects, studies, etc. to no avail.  Because Zoloft is not illegal or socially unacceptable, her denial seems as big or bigger than I have seen in active addicts of alcohol and other drugs.  I never badger her, of course.  I don't bring it up anymore, because she refuses to acknowledge any of what I'm saying here. I am very careful to stay present and nonthreatening in almost all my interactions with her.  I'm not perfect at it, but do pretty well, because if I don't her reactions are exaggerated.
     Any suggestions about how to handle all this, other than the standard intervention?
