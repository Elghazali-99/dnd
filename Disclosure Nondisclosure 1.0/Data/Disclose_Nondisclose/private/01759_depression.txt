Hi I am 23 years only I am on cilift - one tablet a day - trepiline - 10mg one tablet an day - Rivotril - I tablet a day.
I have been on the rivotrol for about 7 months and trepiline about a year.
 Cilift - I have been on for about 4 years and would like to go off this once I am off the other tablets
 For one week I took 3 quarters of Rivotril and I am now on my second week taking half tablet. On my 3rd week I will be only taking a quarter and 4th weak nothing.
I am feeling very ill and have bad headaches. I went through a bad break up and needed some support (reason for the tablets) I am now stable and would like to go off of them. I am going to be doing one tablet at a time.
 Reason for my depression is the shock of being dumped after 4 years.
I am happy and content and would like to get off the tablets as they are interfereing with my intermit life.
 Please advice if going off the rivitrol the way I am going off is fine and how to get off the other tablets.
 Your help is greatly appreciated
