I'm 18 years old, and I have a son of my own. My mother over the years has become emotionally and verbally abusive to anyone she is near. I no longer live with my mother anymore because of her actions. My main concern though is my little sister. My mother yells at her for no reason. I've lived with this my whole life and I don't want to see my sister go through this too. My little sister just currently turned 6 years old last month and she is a diabetic. My mother does come around and help with the diabetes, but I feel when she yells at her, it puts a toll on my sister emotionally and I don't know what to do. My mother has started this and now she is freaking out even when she spills the slightest bit of coffee. I've tried contacting attorney's and what not, but nobody will respond to my calls. I've left at least 6 voice mails to different people. Just not one word. I feel that soon my sister will be endangered and I wanna help her before she gets physically abused next. What should I do?
