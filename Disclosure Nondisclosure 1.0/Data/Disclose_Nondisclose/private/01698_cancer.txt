Im trying to figure out if i might have a brain tumor and also if i might be having seizures. Im very worried and none of my doctors are really listening to me except my PT. She helped me get into a neurologist but that's not for another month. 
 For the past 4 months iv been having a lot of symptoms, some longer than others.  I have been having:
 - headaches that last all day and turn into really bad migraines
- nausea that comes and goes throughout the day
- problems with balance
- extreme fatigue, i'm just tired all the time
- dizziness and lightheadedness that almost last all day
- trouble with memory
- body weakness, especially in my arms and legs
- flank pain
- extreme back pain
- internal and outward body shakes
- difficulty climbing stairs, standing and walking
- felling faint
- feeling irritable and angry all the time even though im not an angry person
- getting confused when talking with others
 I'm also wondering if i'm have seizures. Iv been having these body jerks, they feel like i'm getting electrocuted. They only last for a second but i can get about 7 in a row within 2 minutes. Before i get the jerks my head and ears start to feel hot and i feel like im going to faint. I also sometimes zone out at random times and someone has to snap me out of it. When these things happen i feel like i'm detached from my body.
 I really don't know what to do and i'm very scared. Has anyone else gone through any of these things too?
