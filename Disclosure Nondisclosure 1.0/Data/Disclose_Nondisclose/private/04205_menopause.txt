im only 40 years old and i have been suffering with so many symptoms that i cannot cope much longer!! my periods have been irregular for 2 years now and sometimes went without a period for 6 months. instead of going to the doctors i just assumed it was to do with my life style and stress. now they have been here for 3 weeks and im having a really bad time of being dry and swollen and slight smell coming from my vagina. this has just started happening for the last 2 months, but has been so bad i ended up going to a vd clinic thinking i had caught some disease!! i have been having terrible mood swings and feeling very lonely at times, i am acting like a maniac and cant control my temper and emotions. also i am sleeping for 14 hours at a time and am constantly exhausted, i have no motivation to do housework and takes me a long time and effort to just get ready when awake. i could have slept well over 10 hours and later on in the day i get such an urge to sleep that i have just had to lie down and sleep saying im going for a nap but end up sleeping right through to the next day if i can. its really getting me down and interfering with my life with my 2 kids, they also are suffering because of my sleeping constantly!! mabee im going through premature menopause and could well be going through it for 2 years with my symptoms.. its getting a lot worse though and i feel that im going mad sometimes. i never thought it was menopause until i started getting problems down below and at first just thought i was getting thrush all the time. after went to clinic i realised when results came back negative that mabee im going through menopause!! i have also put on a lot of weight and always was slim but now look much more rounder especially round my stomach! please help me and diagnose what im going through as im not coping at all. thank you......
