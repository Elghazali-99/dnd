So my boyfriend if 2years left me on Monday, and it wasn't a mean break up it was kind. He says he still loves me and I know he still does but he doesn't want us to end up hating eachother through our relationship as we were having the odd arguments, he's also suffering from depression and at the moment it's like he has given up on everything. 
I lived with him at my parents house and about a month ago we found out we was pregnant and he's told me he will always be their to support me and provide for the baby even though where not together. 
When he got his things he kept giving me a hug and we cried but he said it's something he has to do. He wants to remain friends and so do I because I don't want him out of my life
 I love him so much and this is so painful I have never felt so alone before I don't have friends to talk to. I used to live with him until the other day, I was constantly With him talking to him and now I have nobody :'( my parents dont even know I'm pregnant so that's stressing me out. 
  I asked if their is anything in the future for us and he said no because we have tried and it doesn't seem to work, and it breaks my heart because I know he loves me but he's stopping himself from being with me.
I feel so lonely having nobody to talk to and cry too :'(
 I just don't know what to do and need someone to talk to
