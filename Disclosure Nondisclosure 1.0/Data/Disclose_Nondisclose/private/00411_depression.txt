I am 16 and have had the most wonderful life. I have the best parents in the world and have everything I could wish for but i cannot be happy. For the last two years I've been constantly moody and I can't remember the last time I was actually happy. I feel so bad about it because I know it will break my mum and dads hearts if I tell them I'm unhappy because they'll blame themselves and it's not them, it's just me and I feel so bad because I have no reason to be sad. Last year my friend tried to kill herself twice because of this girl who has caused some pain in my life too. This year I seem to have got worse and I hate it so much. I have anxiety and was diagonsed with it in October after becoming paranoid about my health( I got weird head sensations, visual snow, lump in throat etc anxiety symptoms). Anyway, I've tried to ignore the fact I have anxiety and move on but I'm so low all the time. Like i said I have everything, but I'm never really happy. I can't even go a week without crying its so bad. Is there any way I can ease this without seeing the doctors or a counsellor. I don't want to tell my parents because it will make them so upset and I don't want that because i love them so Much. I'm sick of it, I'm so scared I'm not going to pass my a levels because of this. I seem fine at school, but I'm not. I come home and I break down and I dont even know why. Suggestions??
