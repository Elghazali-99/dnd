10 months ago i met the girl of my dream shes amazing, she cares for me and we get on so well. but over the last few months i have being losing my temper with her for no apparent reason, yes we both no how to push each others buttons but just lately i have being really aggressive towards her i keep putting it down to me being made redundant at the beginning of this year but it is no excuse though because she does nothing wrong most of the time i just snap with her when she comes home from work. we do sit down and talk and she is very understanding and does her best to help me but sometimes i don't think she understands how i feel and judges me wrong. i feel so guilty for sitting at home despite spending 7 hours a day looking for jobs and doing the house work i just feel guilty all the time she says money means nothing to her and i must admitt she has never asked me for anything and has always spoilt me rotten and offered to pay for stuff but i just feel such a failure, and i keep getting paranoid that she will hurt me because i feel down about my self and this makes me lash out and accuse her of everything. i just want to no what i can do to accept that she loves me for me and stop losing my temper with her and worrying about everything.
