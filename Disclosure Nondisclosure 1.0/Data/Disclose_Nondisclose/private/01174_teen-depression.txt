so I'm 13 and i think I'm depressed but i cant tell my parents. 
i self harm quite a lot and i started about a couple of years ago, its really hard to stop and hide the scars. My older sister is horrible to me and she keeps on calling me a emo freak cuz she saw some of the cuts on my thigh. if i tell me parents that I'm depressed they might just tell me its my hormones and that I'm fine, but i really don't fell fine. i cry my self asleep every night and most of the time i feel very tearful. i used to enjoy doing lots of things with my family, but now i don't like hanging around with anyone and I'm very anti-social.  i have lots of self-hatred and at night i can't get to sleep it takes me around about 3 hours for me to fall asleep and even when i finally fall asleep i wake up several time and then i get up very early in the morning.  i always feel sick and i never want to eat but my older sister is very controlling and she forces me to eat. i spend most of my time in my bedroom and i feel a presence in there so we talk but sometime i just feel as if I'm going metal.
so please help me
