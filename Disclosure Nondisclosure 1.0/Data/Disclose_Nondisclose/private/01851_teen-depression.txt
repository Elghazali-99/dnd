Hey everyone,
First of all, thank you for taking the time and reading my question (sorry, my english is not that good)
I have been feeling very depressed for the last 2-3 months, I'm a 15 year old boy, I don't have much friends at school, it's not that no one talks to me, but I just dont find interest in them. I have 2 really close friends. I tell them everything about me and they are starting to get worried about why I am so down lately. I really have no idea why !
Even my father began to notice, but I don't want to tell him because he has alot of stress at work and I don't want to cause more trouble for him. I don't feel a need for anything and I still feel really sad. 1 week ago I asked one of my really good friends out, but she rejected. It made me feel even worse and since then I have been thinking about commiting suicide. Everything in my life is going bad, my parents got divorced a couple of years back, my grandfather died, at school even teachers ignore me. The only thing I have left are my 2 female best friends. I'm starting to get really sick and tired of these depressions. Please help me
