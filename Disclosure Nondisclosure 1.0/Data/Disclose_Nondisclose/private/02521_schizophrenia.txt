I'm posting here,because it seems fitting,to me. my "symptoms" are;I can not seem to think clearly, I have a hard time retaining information to a ridiculous level,I can't really have conversations with anyone because I simply can not think it's like a thoughts are erased from my mind and I'm completely blank,I feel detached a lot, my family is convinced that I am paranoid..I don't know what to think..I mainly think that they are telling me this to sway me to make me think I am paranoid so they can continue to do what  they do and get away with it. Theres more, but this is all I will put..unless it will help to hear more. I don't know whats wrong with me or if there is anything wrong with me. I have been in thereapy off and on since I was 16, they seem to be clueless and I am thinking that I am just wasting my time. They say I have anxiety, I do feel anxiety sometimes or something...does this sound correct could it be anxiety or some type of schizophrenia? A side note, I have been going to a day hospital and recently perscribed Abilify, which I am afraid to take.
