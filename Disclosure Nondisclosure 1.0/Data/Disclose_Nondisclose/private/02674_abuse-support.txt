I'm a 47 year old female who from the ages of 7 to 10 was sexually abused by my brother who was 10 years older than me.At the time I didn't understand what was happening was wrong in fact I can't say it was horrible it was only as I became older and realized it wasn't normal that I felt the revulsion.I have been through counselling as an adult but found it useless in getting rid of my guilt,He would give me money & candy in my eyes I feel I was a prostitute at 7.I did confront him as a 26 year old,he said he couldn't remember,at least he didn't deny it.I told my parents 2 years later, they didn,t seem to worry about it and it was never talked about again,I don't think they even confronted him,my sister who was a baby at the time just said he never did anything to her and she still loves him,this all happened 40 years ago and I find it doesn't really get any easier.my mother died so my dad lives with us and he still talks to him which is really hard when I pick up the phone and hear his voice it brings back all the revulsion I feel towards him.How do you get it out of your head there are times when it's like a horror movie just picturing everything he did in that 3 year period.Does anyone have ideas on how to stop these visions.
