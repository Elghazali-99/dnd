Hi, I need help !!!!!! my BIL has lived next to us for  year now and it has been a nightmare the entire time. we have been married for 16 yrs now with 3 kids. in the beginning his mom was the problem. many many yrs of problems. well he finally stepped up to her and now its his brother. i fought for many yrs to get things straight with her and do not have the strength nor the willingness to fight this one out that long.i have been fighting with him for a yr now and its not getting any better. i ask him to include me in decisions n respect me but my husband will not change . the latest thing is the worthless trouble making bil used my hubbys name when he got pulled over by the cops instead of his own because he would of been arrested for driving on a suspend license. this has been over a month ago n the bum still has not even given us the money for the attorney to represent my husband. he still does not have the money n court is this month. my husband still defends him n blames me for pushing.  i am at my end i can't take it anymore,i want to walk away because of the stress its putting my family in but i love my husband but doesn't know if his love is really true,he says it is but why doesn't he stand up for us. then to top it off i told him today i am leaving n he said i am crazy,thats why i m leaving because i am crazy. i know deep down that he can't love me the way he is supposed to or he wouldn't be letting this happen..... HELP
