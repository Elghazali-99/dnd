My three sisters and I suffered a lot of emotional, sexual and physical abuse as children in Las Vegas. I am the oldest so I would always do my best to protect them. We were in and out of shelters and often did not have our basic needs met much less higher needs of love. Our mother is bi polar manic depressive and had frequent episodes of mania which sparked abuse. So extreme that I remember her forcing one of my twin sisters to take a bottle of my psyche medicine. Melissa was sick for weeks.  Our father was alcoholic and a sexual tormenter of my sisters he would also bring people into the home that would abuse us as did my mother. At 18 I attempted suicide and neither one visited me. After I became better I moved out and took my youngest sister with me. Over the next 10 years my emotions stabilized and I am now able to take care of my twin sisters as well. But I am now 31 years old and find it so hard to connect with people and I always feel alone and scared in my mind. Every holiday season it is bad for me I have panic attacks about death and dying and feel I have HIV, I am gay but not sexually active. If I do find somebody I give and give in the relationship and it consumes me.  It is better now three of us live in CA now away from Las Vegas... Melissa as she was mildly retarded and my youngest sister and I rent a house together but though better my fears imprison me...I just want to be carefree and happy..I know other people have it worse and I am being selfish but I feel so empty ...like there is not really a me inside but only a reflection of those around me....has anyone experienced these feeling and if so do you have advise on how to sort them out? Thanks so much....and I hope all is well for everyone =)
