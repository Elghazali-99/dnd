Hi 
I am a woman in my mid- late thirties and although there are some positives in my life, and today i feel pretty good, i still feel crippled by strange abuse i went through for ten years when i was a kid. When i try to research similar stories, i always find sexual or physical abuse stories. Even the verbal and emotional abuse situations that i read about are only somewhat similar. My stepmother did some pretty weird things that still make me ashamed to say out loud ( even printing it is making me cringe). 
I guess i should give a few examples.
She constantly accused me of peeing in my pants and would make me stand bent over at the waist with my hands in a large bucket of very cold water for long periods of time, or sit on the toilet for hours, sometimes until my little butt would get stuck. She would cut my hair very short every sunday and dress me in some very outfits for school, and once had a fake birth certificate made up claiming my new name was Goonie. A few times i had to drink small amounts of bleach. I wasnt allowed to brush my teeth, have friends, do homework, eat with a fork or drink water. 
Wow, a lot more came out than i meant to say. These are examples of the easier things that i went through. I woke up scared with a pit in my stomache and everyday went to bed that way too. (always right after i did the dishes!) It was like she wanted me to go crazy, and im pretty sure shes succeeded in lots of core ways, although i know that i come across to people as very together, very normal.
My question is how do i get help? I dont even know how to categorize this abuse. A knowledgable person who used to know me and some of my situation once told me that she thought i might have post traumatic stress disorder but ive read thats what POWS have, not kids, plus it was more tgan twenty years ago.
In a few years i will be in my forties and i dont want to still feel broken inside.
Thank you for any help or suggestions
