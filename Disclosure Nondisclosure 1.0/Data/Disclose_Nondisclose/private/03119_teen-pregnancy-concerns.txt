I am 19 and I had sex a little over a week ago, and it happened to be on my most fertile day of ovulation. the past few days I have had really really bad cramps, I'm really nauseous and the smell of certain foods makes me feel sick when they never have before, I'm really bloated, I'm sleeping 8-9 hours every night and taking naps and I still feel exhausted, my breasts are really sore, my lower back hurts, I'm having really bad headaches, and I have really weird discharge. I've never felt like this before and I'm not supposed to get my period for another 12 days. my periods are always 28 days apart and are the same every time and I get cramps about 2 days before my period. is it even possible for me to be having pregnancy symptoms already? or does it sounds like I might be pregnant or is it all in my head? this is not the first time I've had sex and I've never felt like this any time after. we used a condom but I know condoms still fail, even though they never have before for us.
