today i read through BPD, and was shocked in how accurate it described me. what struck me was the absolute violent fluctuation in mood without reason, my continued pattern of suspicion and rejection of goals, people, my skills, the emptiness i commonly feel, my depression throughout university, suicidal attempts and thoughts, and substance abuse. 
 i suspect it is due to a very traumatic experience i had when i was about six where my dad attempted to murder my mom in front of me by choking her....she passed out but woke after a while....i have trouble remembering other details about that day but i remember the overwhelming shock that throws me into anxiety and immense stress. throughout my childhood, my father had trouble controlling his rage and was dominating, and would beat my mother in front of me. he would beat me too if i didn't do things his way....the theme of my childhood would be GUILT.... i try letting go, that sometimes these things i cannot control, but i cannot erase it.
 i talked to a friend, and he said everyone feels that way and that im being childish. is this true ? am i just describing a bad day ? am i being an attention ***** ? so does everyone have the most wretched emotions. the constant torment of fluctuating emotions and trying to drown it using substance.
 i kept all of this inside myself for a long time and just finally letting go, trying to fix myself step at a time. OR am i being selfish by labeling myself as BPD ? is BPD a real problem ? should i get help ? are there drugs that i can use to "normalize" my mood fluctuations ?
