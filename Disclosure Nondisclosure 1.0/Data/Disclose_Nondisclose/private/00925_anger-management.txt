Just joined and not sure if this is the proper forum but I have an 18 yo daughter that has been horribly angry since she popped her head out the day she was born. I see a lot of me in her and was just diagnosed with bipolar, ADD and PTSD which should have nothing to do with her anger issues..I grew out of my anger but burned a lot of bridges along the way and would appreciate any advice from anyone that has a child that has dealt with anger issues with success..or even yourself..I would like to nip it in the bud as she has so much potential. It is not just a teenage thing...I have 5 children..she is the third. She is beautiful and I say that because it is not her self esteem...of course I think all my kids are beautiful because they are mine but in reality, to you, maybe not. So when I say she is beautiful, she IS on the outside. She was always the one that was stopped and told how gorgeous she was, even with my other children in tow... but can be very mean and hurtful and her outbursts are just intolerable. Because she received so much attention I subconsciously tended to favor her sister because I felt bad and did not want her to grow up feeling lesser than.. (yes, I know it isn't important but tell that to a 12 year old girl...any preteen, teenage girl). Consequently she is very jealous of her older sister because she blossomed into a beautiful young woman, has lots of GREAT friends, goes to a prominent University, makes good choices and has herself together. Ana, on the other hand, is mad as heck and blames me for her hopeless life, etc. Any advice? Sorry for the book!
