hi everyone well heres my story .. towards the end of octoberishh i started feeling this pain on my uppper right inner thigh [which is called inguinal area] .. it happened right after i was stretching my leg .. so i might of stretched it a little too much  and i guess got a muscle pull ... it hurt for a while only wen i would stretch as in squeeze my muscles kind of thing .. i got a bruise there too but it wen away within a few days ... wen i stretch it out tho its feels better too .. before i used to wake up every morning and that whole area kind of felt numb but it would go away within a few minutes after i stretch .. i dnt feel nething weird around that area as in bumps and stuff nd no pain either other then when im menstruating .. but thats just normal .. i did go to the doctor for a physical and told him about it and he told me most likely its a muscle pull and those take a while to heal especially because im on my feet all day .. and i dnt know if im just paranoid or something but i still feel pain there .. i mean i honestly feel its gettin better everyday because every morning now wen i get up i dnt feel numbness .. like its getting better but is it just really a muscle pull? and im just being paranoid ? .. ugh why does this stuff always have to happen to me!
 if this info helps ... im 20 yr old female never had any health problems and i have yrly checkups and bloodwork .. and everything always comes out fine my recent one was in mid december .. please nething would be helpful cause im driving myself crazy .. if it was something worse it would have been happened right? ...
