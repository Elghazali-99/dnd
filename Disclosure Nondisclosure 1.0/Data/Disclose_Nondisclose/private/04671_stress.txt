I pulled my calf muscle and did not originally rest it much. I had swelling, however, little pain-mostly swelling and tightness. no bruising or discoloration. I went the the Dr. they did an ultrasound and ruled out a clot. I went to the PT and he said I could go back to my workout as it was a minor strain on the gastroc. Last weekend Friday, Sat, and Sunday I hit it hard with a 2 high impact aerobic class and weight lifting. By the end of the Sunday high aerobic impact class, I was feeling some discomfort/pain in my knee and then also in the foot on the injured leg. On Monday, I noticed that the swelling had slightly increased (from where it was prior to my weekend workouts)  and the calf area was tight and swollen again. Last night (Tues), I iced, applied heat, and iced again with elevation. The swelling seems to be moving down my leg and is now in the anke. My original injury was median and I thought originally under the right knee. It wasn't a major pain sensation so I continued working out.
The only discomfort I have now is tightness in the middle of the calf with swelling (no bruising). Should I be concerned that my right calf is still swollen. My original injury was about 2 weeks ago. My job is active as I am an OT with kids so I am on my feet all day.
I also saw a Chiro and he gave it some electrical stim and ultrasound on Monday. I am going back to him tomorrow. 
Anything else I can do to decrease the swelling??
How active should I be at this point??
