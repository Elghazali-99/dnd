Hi, I'm 19 and in my second year of college. I am extreamly stressed out and that's causing me to gain weight and break out and then that adds even more stress. It started a year ago when I broke up with my boy friend also my best friend. I graduated high school, started college, moved out, my parents told my family and I that they are getting a divorce, (it was really unexpected by everyone) my older sister got married and had a baby girl which I love and is a blessing. However because of school and the divorce I am now living in my 5th house in the last year. I have no place to call home anymore. My dad works all week now I never get to see him and he is kinda broke. My mom complains about money but is always flying to Texas to see her "boyfriend". I'm not one to cry. I hardly ever do. When my parents bring something up about the divorce it makes me mad and I can't talk about it without crying. I'm the middle child and I'm the only one who seems troubled by this. Most days I'm fine but then I have the days I'm so annoyed inside I feel like im crazy. Like I'm about to just lose it and snap. I'm just really lost in life right now and can't seem to get a good grip of things. I need my stress to just vanish! Idk how to handle it. Any suggestions?
