I caught my husband of 17 years in an affair with a female co worker. He also admitted going to prostitutes because he claims he wasn't getting enough sex at home. He is a workaholic. I mean 99.9% of the time. He is extremely driven, he is very neat, anal, has little tolerance. He also just doesn't kiss me the way a man should kiss a woman. Lovemaking was robotic and he did ask for anal sex a fair amount, which I really was not into. He was homophobic, or at least appeared to be until he aged a bit (he is now 47). I recently found that he has visited gay porn sites and even a site that says help I think I am bisexual. He is very secretive generally, doesn't share emotions, never really let me in and I respected his need for privacy. Besides, I wasn't worried, all he did was work, or so I thought. I am a very attractive, fit, fun loving, open person. I am very angry that I may have been a cover for him. I think this might explain much of his behavior but I do not know if it was just curiosity or a momentary blip or something deep. There was always something not right. He just didn't let me in. But, his entire family is like that. Much pride and they never show weakness.
