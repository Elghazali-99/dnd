So I just posted but I thought I'd give more detail. I had gotten my period September 19th and it only lasted three days. 
 The day after it was over my boyfriend and I have been having unprotected sex 2-3 times a day for two weeks straight. And each time he came in me. 
 Usually we are really careful about this he would pull out or I would get a plan b pill the next day. But I've just been too busy and kept putting it aside or forgetting. 
 I just got a plan b yesterday October 3rd but I'm aware they only work 3-4 days after. So I know that it won't afect the other week and a half.
 But today, October 4th, I've just been so out of it. My so tired and having pains in my upper stomach kinda like congestion in the center of my rib cage. Or like nauseous. Also Non stop yawning, and shortness of breath. I havnt been able to get a hold of my breath right. 
 I'm not sure how soon symptoms start when once your pregnant. But could these be any? Or what is the probability I'm pregnant
