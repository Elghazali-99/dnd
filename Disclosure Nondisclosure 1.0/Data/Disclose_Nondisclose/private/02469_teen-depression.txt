At the beggining of school, the begining of middle school, i was making friends. Those first few months there was no hate, not much drama, just curiosity of the new life ahea of us, the next step. Well, after awhile rumors started to spread about me. I dont know why, i dont know how, and i dont know who, but randomly people chose me to hate. I only have a good 3-4 friends at school that i can turn to. But no matter what, i cant fight the words to come out, about how i feel. People call me a ****, a *****, think i have sex and ****. Some people apparently think ive been preggo? I dont even know.. I dress normally,
Regular jeans, t shirts... Nice hair... U dont know.. I dont even kiss anyone besides my boyfriend of like 4-5 months alex. Which is just barely a peck though. Whenever i wear skirts people call me slutty. Even if its a long skirt. Sigh. Im getting depressed, and have a lot of stress on my shoulders. Most people that i know and even people i dont know at school hate me... I can see it in how tey talk about me, look at me, act around me. And it hurts because i think one boy actualkt cares abd is noticing this, but doesnt know how to help. I see a sense of hope and care in his eyes. He tries to make me laugh. But... I really dont know. Also what ive said is only
A small part of my verbal abuse at school... Sometimes people shove me into walls randomly... 
 At home i have supportive parents but they dont know about all ive said. They dont know what i go through. My dad wouldnt understand.. Whenever i try and tell him something like my brothers being mean he just says tell them to stop. I do. My brothers are 13 and 17
And are both mean to me for no reason. I havent done anything for them to hate me. Nut they are like.. Best friends. They donice things for eachoter. It makes me sick. I can tell my mom would be there if i needed it but.. Its rough... I cant tell her, its just... I dont have the ability... 
Lately i just write poety, musoc on my piano, or i just write. Stories sometimes. Im getting bad grades in Panguage Arts because thats the only class i actualky get alot of homework and the teacher is very strict and mean. She yelled at me because one of my bestfriends 23 year ild brother died so we wore pjs to school and brought small teddy bears.. She didnt care... I cried so hard. I feel like i have no one to turn to, no one to love. In some classes my grades are
Slipping.school is ending in 2 weeks so im happy for that and even if i fail a class they canceled summer school this sumemr so i you do fail it doesnt matter unless you are doing so bad that you get pulled back, but i wont. Also ive been
Sick for
Two weeks. And im so stressed that my period is like 40 days late.
 Ive cut once or twicr but thats something im avoiding.
I have a few scars so lately ive been wearong stuff that covers my arms butno one
Even noticess.
 Ive teied talking to a school counselor, but its hard for me.
 Im only 12, being put through this. Plus, this is only like half of what im going through right now. I could go on for hours discussing my misery. I just want to sleep forever, dream a new world.
I have sleep insomnia so i only get a few hours of sleep a night and fall asleep in class sometimes. 
 The worst part? I try to be happy, at school to cover up the pain. To show people what they say dosnt affect me. But wether i show it or not, people try to hurt me. I seem all optimostic, confident, and a spazz at school, but when i come home i crash.
"everything happens for a reason" i repeat tht, and i do believe tht eventually it will get better, but until then, what can i do? I dont see a change no matter how hard i try. And even if i try
To tell people about my depression, i feel as if i will be frowned upon.
Help me:(
