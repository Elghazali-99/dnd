Im 16 years old, and I have an amazing life..I have everything I ever wanted (my girlfreind, and amazing parents) 
A month and a half ago I got really addicted to video games and I took them way too seriously..and I coudnt beat this one level I kept trying and trying and then im like screw this..and got so pissed and bashed my head against the wall but it wasnt so hard..i started getting very paranoid about it..i started getting thaughts what If i have a internal bleeding in my head, a tumor..cuz my head started to hurt. I forgot about it for a week..then I went to a teen club with my freinds and then my dad called me up and started yelling at me about something stupid and i started worrying then i had headaches again, high blood pressure etc. Every night I would be worried about If Ill wake up or not..We took MRI's, Blood Tests, and EKGS, ECGS..Neurologists, everything was fine..I dont know why I'm still worried about it. Cuz ive been hearing diffrent stories about deaths..and ive been taking them too seriously..like my frend had a nightmare that I got killed and told it to me while I was worrying which freeked me out even more.
