I have no idea what to do about my situation. Recently I have been under a whole lot of stress, the normal teenage thing though 'this guy..'. You see, to put a very long story in short terms, I've been having problems with my bestfriend, and a guy. He would do anything for her, and when she told him to ask me out, he did. Though, somehow, I was suposed to know that he didn't really like me. I broke it off quickly, not thinking about the possibility that he never liked me in the first place. The next couple weeks we spent talking, and I started to think I liked him agian. He kept telling me things to make me feel good about myself, you know, as guys do. I fell for it for a while. Then, three days ago, I realized that he was 'in love' with my bestfriend. Well, she leads him on ALL the time, and it angers me, but I can be a pushover, and I let it slide. Now that I found out he only acted as though he liked me because my friend told him to, I am stressed. I then found out a day ago that he had a girlfriend even when dating me. But that is what my 'best' friend told me, she's been behind this the whole time so I'm not sure. 
 When he told me his reasoning for doing this to me I laughed at him and told him Thank you. Thank you for showing me what this feels like because now this type of situation will never happen EVER agian. 
 But I haven't been eating much lately, and every time I go to eat I gag on the food. If I get the food down it just comes back up. So I just gave up on eating, which I know is not healthy. I'm thining it could be Anorexia induced by stress. What do you think?
 I'm drifting away from the majority of my closest friends, I feel like they can't be trusted. I don't know, I'm only fifteen and a Sophmore in High School. I can deal with this, I just need a little help.
