When I was young (12) I spent a lot of time with a new family friend who was the same age.
We got along famously and would stay up late laughing in the bed we shared at his house, his cottage,
my house or whereever.  One night, while staying at his cottage, I woke to find him performing oral sex on me.
At 12, I honestly wasnt even sure what he was doing but didnt move and pretended I was asleep even though 
I ejaculated. In the morning, it was as though nothing had happened.  We didnt talk about it and acted as though
we were still normal friends. I felt violated, humiliated, scared and uncertain of my emotions. Each night, it would happen again (our families thought we wanted to share beds because we were such close friends), I would pretend to be asleep, no words were exchanged and in the morning the slate was wiped clean, so to speak.  I began to resent the fact that in my head I couldnt tell my mother because of the shame and his parents were going through a divorce.  His father was an alcoholic in the highest order and his mother would have sex with random police officers loudly as we heard her screams from our bed in the next room.  His brother was suffering his own emotional, physical and probably sexual abuse as well.  Looking back, I wonder if his father had been sexually abusive with him.  I mean, how does a 12 year old learn how to give oral sex? 
My question is...Is this abuse if the perpetrator was the same age?  I never once acknowledged he was doing it and in fact never reciprocated.  I began to enjoy it though which makes me think that perhaps I was complicit in some way. 
As a side note: This "friend" went on to school to be an undertaker and during his internship was caught having sex with one of the dead male bodies.  When I found this out... I felt guilty for just laying there pretending to be asleep all those times. lol
