I have been really depressed latley. I'm a 13 year old girl. I moved in to a new school in the start of the year so I don't know everyone that well. I don't exactly have any friends at the school in the first month or so I hanged out with these 2 girls. ( I'm gunna call them friend 1 and friend 2) friend 1 I thought was more closer to me than friend 2 and she always talked crap about friend 2 behind her back. I don't know why but I began to belive her and started to hate friend 2. Then after a while friend 1 was beginning to be rude to me and calling me names. Then I began to notice friend 2 was wayyyy more of a friend than friend 1. So I began to hang out with her and not friend 1. Then I don't know why friend 1 got really mad at me she said friend 2 told her I called her a *****. Which was not true.  So friend 1 and 2 started to hang out together and I had no one. I lost it. I cryed when u went to bed. I almost self harmed but didn't. After a while we all began talking again. I later learned that friend 1 was lying and friend 2 never said that. So me and friend 2 became friends again but I still did not like the way friend 1 ignored me and talked to and about me so I did not really forgive her. The problem was friend 1 and 2 were still friends. I tried hanging out with us 3 again like we used to but friend 1 still did the same thing. I was not going to be a rude person and tell friend 2 she can not hang out with friend 1. So I just hanged out with myself. But friend 2 did not really care if I hanged out with them or not so I'm not sure if she's still my friend or not. Or if I'm just her second choice. I really don't know anymore and I often see both if them giving me dirty looks and other stuff like that. Is this normal or is this just stupid. :/ help me....
