i have been with this guy for past 3 years and 3 months now. In the beginning it was all good,he was good to me and everything it just seemed perfect,but then i found it that the first 6 months werent tht great as he was cheating on me with some other female of my college only but a yr senior to me.My bf is 2 yrs elder to me,I am 21 and will be 22 this august and he 24 this july.When i found out he was cheating on me..he didnt make any efforts to pace up the things infact it was me who tried to make things better for both if us and we continued with our relationship without breaking up.He realized his mistake and asked for forgiveness and that he wouldnt repaet it ever.
Then all was goin well..but even hen his phone used to switched off for days and weeks..or sometimes i used to keep callin him and he never answered (i called him for like 100+ times too,in a day!) But then he used to convince me and i like a cow got easily convinced too.1.5 yrs it went like this,but still i was fine cuz whenever we used to meet or talk on phone all seemed super sweet and romantic.and i used to be happy with the fact that atleast he is talkin to me.And to prove that i am serious for him i even went out holidaying with him for like 6 days and we came pretty close to each other.i used to hesitate a bit cuz i had saved the best of me for my hubby and i already had dreams of marrying him in future,and he used to talk about marriage too.so my hesitation went away and there was love all over.!! :)
But when uhe used to go back (long distance relationship it is) then again no picking up the phone calls etc..!and then our relationship bitter when a guy friend called me up late at night at 1 am and the other day he checks my phone and sees the call i explained tht he is just a friend but he slapped me for the first time and even abused me.though he apologised later and made up for it and even understood that he was just a friend.but then he started suspecting on my loyalty and used to often abuse me on phone and say things that would hurt me a big time.And then it was all good but after few months he started ignoring me again and did not talk to me for 27 days-for the first time for sooo many days.and in between this guy who really used to like me supported me and i kinda used to meet him at his place and watch movies and stuff.And we got pretty close and then my bf came back so that guy who used to like me stepped out.I felt bad but i couldnt help it.so everything was good again..though i had this guilt of meeting the another guy..but he made me meet his mom..gave me ring on my bday..wanted to marry me..wanted to make up for all the bad things he did to me..and with time that guilt went away too.But then again he vanished for few days and abused my best friend accusing her of making me drink and smoke which i did cuz my relationship was not going well and not cuz of her.so we kinda broke up and the same guy who used to like me..i met him again..and this time we got drunk together and we kinda got too intimate..which i still regret.that guy too didnt call me after that night.I feel soo used and though that I am the biggest fool ever..!! :'( 
And then like after evry break up he came back again and met me..and promised to make things good..i had this guilt so i told him that i was drunk and i dont know what happened and he forgave me and hugged me and said i'll never let u go now,i'm sorry it is all cuz of me..i am to be blamed..!!and all was going pretty good,his mom likes me..so do his sisters..and have no objection for our marriage..!though my parents have as he called at my place drunk and spoke to my father for 45 minutes.and my parents call him a drunkard and hates him and they are noe even looking for a guy for me(arranged marriage).
Now my relationship is all well..and i guess..all the doubts on loyalty and violent behaviour is cuz of distance.also he thinks my friends are not good enough which is kinda true they always backstab!!..but still inspite of everything being good now..he drinks a lot..and often calls me all drunk and talks crap and insults me.but then later apologises..!once i decided to break p with him(permanent one)..had made up my mind..but he cried sooo much that i became sure of his love for me..he does love me but then why does he behave like that?..i have had tough days with him in the past and i still didn leave him..why doesn he understand that?..also i feel guilty cuz i was with this another guy the whole night though i dun talk to him now..and neither he called after that night..i feel super guilty about it!..what should i do?!? please help//!!
