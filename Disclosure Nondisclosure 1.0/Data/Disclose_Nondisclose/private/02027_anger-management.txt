I've been married for a little over 2 years. We had a baby 1 year ago. I had anger problems but they didn't affect my relationship with my husband like they do now (post baby).
Right now we fight regularly, I have considered leaving several times. When we fight I can become very cold and mean. If he says something accusational even if it's true and he has a right to be angry, I attack him for everything I've been angry for (in the past). He shuts down when I do this and then I apoligize. Time goes by  and then later I do it again.
My mother was very mean to us when she was angry. she would yell at us when something bad happened in her life (having nothing to do with us). I am just like my mother, when as  a kid I swore i would never be like her.
On top of problems with my husband I am depressed and sometimes paranoid. I have trouble making and keeping friends.
I am afraid that I will treat my son the way I was treated if I don't get a handle on my anger/depression. I'm also afraid I will lose my husband if things don't change. My husband is weary of me because he says he doesn't know when I will explode over something small.
My question is where do I start? I can find a counselor or something but how do I know they can help? Can anyone relate or tell me how things got better for them. 
I have had better times in my life when I trusted people more and felt good about myself and life. I don't know how to get back there.
