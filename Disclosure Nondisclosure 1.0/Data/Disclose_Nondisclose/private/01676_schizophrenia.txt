I am starting to wonder if I am becoming a schizoid? what age do people usually get diagnosed with this? I never want to be around people even when I feel happy I prefer to be alone and do my hobbies when I am not depressed but on occasion I like being around my boyfriend.  I usually feel awkward around most people.  I have very bad anxiety about everything. Right now I am obsessing about depression symptoms.  I constantly feel depersonalized.  Whenever I have talk to someone I cant wait to be alone again. I don't mind chatting on the internet though. Its like I love my personal space way too much.  I dread when the phone rings, I hate the sound of it and I never answer it. I have one good friend that I haven't talked to in 6 months, she called recently but I am afraid to call back because I fear I will get the depersonalization feeling..  I also have chronic irritability where it actually is almost unbearable and painful. Is this schizoid behavior or just depression and anxiety ?
