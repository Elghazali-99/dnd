I recently went through a somewhat nasty and very emotional break with my partner. The problem is, he was under the impression I already knew about the break up in that it happened a year ago. Even after the break, we continued to get together every other week afterwards as we had been doing for a while. The wrinkle to all of this is that at the time I had been taking Wellbutrin for my depression for a few months as well as seeing a therapist.
 Just today I was writing in my journal and decided to look back a year. At the time all of this was happening, I wasn't journaling much and so there are only a handful of entries, but in two of them I mention being aware of my partner seeing someone new. I don't remember writing these entries or the feelings I recorded in them. My question is this: is it possible that the Wellbutrin effected my memory in some way?
 I have been off of the medication since the early part of this year and this break just went down in the past few weeks. The unsettling part is that the feelings I had, the emotions surrounding the break felt fresh and vivid. I doubted everything my partner was saying because it felt to me like this was all just happening. I put the both of us through hell and not only do I feel terrible I don't feel I can trust myself or my memories of that time.
