I'm going to ask everyone & anyone... Has anybody ever had a pinched nerve due to STRESS? I've been living w what I thought was a "kink" in my left blade, shoulder, which caused left arm pain for months... Until my left hand and 2 fingers were "pins & needles." Get this part. I work on the Neuro floor of a hospital w back and neck pts everyday. I know all about Degenerative Disc Disease, blah blah blah. (Sorry-- trying to roll this all in one...)
 My work wont let us work w restrictions (no heavy lifting). The Dr and everyone keeps asking me what I did to injure this area. Im going for an MRI in 2 hrs... I cannot pin point an incident. But I can pin point a time frame of when this started... My husband went off on a drinking bindge for 3-4 days, MIA, no phone call, phone shut off, nobody knew anything. Yes, I need to get out, but feel trapped due to no work, no income, a child in college ($$$).
 As a health professional, i know stress can cause physical & mental damage. Not to mention our floor is incredibley short, work is a non stop, run run run, dont eat, break, etc for 12 hrs, 4 hours sleep, then all over again for another 2-3 days. Nothing gets done at home, and my husband is drunk 24/7, and always on my case...
 Stresssed? Yes. But in reality, can you pinch a nerve due to over stressed? Anyone?
