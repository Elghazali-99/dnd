I have undergone treatment for depression and panic attacks more than a year back. 
 Presently I am not on any medicines except etizola beta for panic attack, I stopped taking medicines five months back as I was having severe side effects, both physical and mental.
 I am quite normal without any medicine except these strange fits of depression specially when I get up in the morning. and during sunset.
 It happens most of the days, I get up with a pounding heart and feel as if I have woken up to a deep sorrow. it takes a while for me to make myself believe that everything is fine
 Similarly during evenings, a strange feeling of loneliness and worthless grasps me. though it disappears after sometime with mediation or breathing exercise, but having these unusual feeling day after day is killing me.
 I cant take anyone shouting or being impolite to me, I have to react or give it back, if I supress my anger I get severe breathless, a choking feeling after hours even days after the incident takes place.
 On days these negative feelings haunt me to the extent I feel extreme breathless I take etizola beta
 Can anyone suggest me how do I get back to normal life? I have a healthy living, I practice meditation still I cant get rid of negative feelings .. can anyone help me get back to normal?
