I do not know if this is a neurological problem but I thought I'd post about it here and see if anyone knows anything about it. I was unable to find anything useful by searching the web. First of all, I have a psychiatric history. I was put on the medication Seroquel by a psychiatrist about 2 years ago. Ever since I started the medication I noticed problems reading. It's like my brain is not interpreting words correctly anymore. When I read the sentence, "What are you doing now", the word now is replaced with cow, or how, or something that resembles the word now. I have to look again to see the sentence for what it really is. This happens constantly when I'm reading and makes it hard to concentrate. I have also noticed that I have a hard time recognizing objects and often mistake them for something else. For instance, a red ashtray I might think is an apple. Usually happens for a brief second and then my mind snaps back to reality. I did not have any of these problems before starting the medication Seroquel. I have discontinued the medication 2 years ago and the symptoms are persisting. Should I see a neurologist about this? What disorder could this possibly be? I am on an antipsychotic again, Risperdal, which is not having any effect on this problem.
