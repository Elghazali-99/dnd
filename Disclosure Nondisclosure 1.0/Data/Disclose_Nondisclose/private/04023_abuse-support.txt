I am 44 and live with my parents.I have diabetes,graves disease and renal failure for which I am on home dialysis every day. My mother who is 76 has always sulked and tried to control.When I was in my 20's and wanting to move in with boyfriends she would always say things like "you know if you move out you will never be allowed back here", her other favourite which she still uses today is about my dad. He has had 3 heart attacks and has a pace maker.She says if I ever left he would have a heart attack and die and it would be my fault.When you here this 24/7 its like trying to break free from a cult.If I do get a boyfriend its like she has to play mind games with him to see who gets control of me, or she tells him tales trying to put him off. My dad seems scared of her and has always let her behave in this appalling way, I also have a brother who loves to join in the abuse of me, or sometimes orchestrates it. My mum thinks the sun shines out of him and even has a special personalilty and voice she puts on for him.I sometimes go to mothers GP and tell her what she does, but all she says is that shes chosen to behave like this and to go out as much as possible.My mother blames her actions on me, if she sulks for a week its because of what Ive said, if she cries(which she does to order) its because I'm nasty to her.To the outside world she is jolly and cant do enough for everyone
she openly slags me off to all who will listen, and clearly she wants me to end up penniless and alone.I am finding it hard to cope with all my conditions and the silent treatment I am getting at home.Ive been on the council housing list for 22 years too!
