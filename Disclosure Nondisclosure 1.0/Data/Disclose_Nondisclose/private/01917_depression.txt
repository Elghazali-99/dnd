Hello,  I started having unexplained anxiety and some depression about 3 months ago. I am 39 and other then some post partum depression that resolved fairly quickly with antidepressant have never experienced this before.  No reason for the anxiety and md thinks hormonal. I was started on Zoloft 3 months ago with klonopin which I take .25 daily. The side effects starting the med were pretty bad although MD thinks it was just anxiety.  I have tried stopping the klonopin twice the first time reduced to .125mg for 4 days then stopped. After 6 days got severe insomnia and was restarted by md.  I have noticed over the last 2 months the symptoms of depression and anxiety get worse 3 days before periods starts then get better after period.  I tried to taper the klonopin again went down to .125 for 10 days and did ok just a slight uptick anxiety.  then 3 days before period started got worse again.   Called md and he increased my Zoloft to 100mg and told me to take the klonopin at previous dose.  Just want  some advice, I hate taking the klonopin afraid of having difficulty getting off although I know it is a very low dose. Reading to many crazy horror stories.  I know that Zoloft if generally very well tolerated so not sure what to think.  Any advice is appreciated.
