My husband is 37 years old. Since we first met six years ago he has had a life full of issues.  He had been through a divorce and had two kids from the previous marriage.  I thought his behaviors were a result of that.  I now believe he may have a mental disorder.  He has never been able to handle stress.  It makes him physically ill.  I have always "taken care of" everything so that he didnt have to.  We are now having serious issues in our marriage.  Whenever he gets stressed he has no emotions and he literally becomes someone else.  He thinks I said things that I never did. He states things that never happened.  He really believes these things to be true.  He cannot remember anything when he "comes out" of the situation.  Its like he blacks out or something.  He is rude and hateful to me.  This happened one other time four years prior after a stressful day in court during a custody battle.  He was driving us and started yelling and hitting the steering wheel.  He swerved all across the road and I tried to tell him he was going to kill us both. He kept saying that it was better that way. I couldnt reason with him.  Finally he pulled over and couldnt remember what even happened.  He was so exhausted he looked like he had not slept in weeks. Now I am experiencing this new situation where he has the same behaviors.  I am worried about him.  This is not how he typically behaves and it is very scary.
