Hello All,
First off, thank you for reading my post and I apologize for how long it is.  
For the last year and a half I have basically been living in agony.  It started one day at work where I felt this weird sensation throughout my body, almost like a wave of heat and then felt like I was going to black out.  I went to the ER and they told me I was fine and was just having a panic attack.  That same night I went into a full blown "attack".  Sweating, feeling faint/lightheaded, shaking, muscles feeling like they were cramping etc.  Went to the ER and was told again that it was anxiety/stress.  I went a few days of feeling better but then it all went down hill.  Basically, for the last 18 months I have had: headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling off-balance (like on an elevator), sharp pains throughout, muscle fatigue, muscle spasms/twitches, all kinds of GI issues (i.e. acid reflux), blurry vision, feelings of what I assume are "hot flashes", skin breakouts, sleeplessness, red palms (sometimes red and white blotches), all kinds of aches and pains.
Been to tons of docs and so far nothing found.  I have never been sick in my life except for the occasional stomach bug or cold.  Now all of a sudden its all raining down on me.
I will say I have had a pretty stressfull last 10 years or so.  So my question is, could years of stress/anxiey cause all these physical issues?  I am pretty educated and know of the effects of stress and anxiety on the body and mind but I just cant wrap my head around it.  I though that I would be over it by now but it seems to be getting worse.  Anyone out there going through or has gone through this?  I would love to see what others have done or been told.  Pleae let me know of any suggestions as my quality of life is now pretty much non-existent.
Thank you and God bless.
