I feel ashamed writing this but I've been making myself sick. Nothing like eating something and then vomiting it back up but I've been neglecting myself by refusing to take my medication for my illness.
 The reason why is mostly because I'm currently out of work with my illness but in the times before I was diagnosed my family always asked me if I've found any jobs and how many I applied for and so on. 
 Since being on long-term sick I knew that when the time came for me to be fully better I would be looking for jobs and applying for them all over again. And the current job market at the moment is tough. I also know that when I would be fully better, my grandparents would be back to their old ways of asking me the usual questions: "got a job yet?" "got an interview yet?" "how many jobs have you applied for?" And so on.
 I don't want to make myself sick as I already know right now I don't feel good at all but I just don't want my family to hassle me over the whole thing. I've already spoken to my counselor who has advised me to perhaps invite my grandparents to a counseling session so they could have some idea of just what I am going through but my grandfather in particular does not believe in mental health issues and stigmatised me when I had general anxiety. (he told me I need to be taken to a mental home).
 So now I feel completely lost and I don't think I've got the strength to go to my doctors and tell them what I've been doing as they'll more than likely put me on anti-depressants.
 I don't want to kill myself, that's not it. But I feel that I know that by making myself ill means that I won't need to be as worried about my family hassling me. It sounds a bit strange actually.
 Just...why do I feel so bad? :(
