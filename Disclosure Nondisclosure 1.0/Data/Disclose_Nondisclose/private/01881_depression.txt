My father molested me when I was around 9-11 years old. I came to my mother told her my story when I was 13. When I told her, I can see in her face that she believed me. She didn't question me over and over if it was true, though her reaction was not what I predicted. She actually told me that "What should I do? put your father in jail?!".I saw in her eyes and in her tone that she put the blame into me. I was the victim and yet I was blamed. I was a kid back then so when I heard her I also blamed myself. I blamed myself that I didn't protect myself from my father. And I blamed myself for trusting my mother. Deep inside I knew that she won't help me and she hates me. Since I was small my mother physically and verbally abused me.
  Right now, whenever I talk to her regarding how she didn't protect me she won't even admit it to herself. All I can hear are excuses and her self-pity for herself. Does asking to admit her mistakes makes me selfish? Am I the one asking to much from her? I feel rage and pity between our relationship. I don't know what to do.
