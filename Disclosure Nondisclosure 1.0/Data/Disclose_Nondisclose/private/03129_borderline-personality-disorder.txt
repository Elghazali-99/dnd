I have been divorced three years. I divorced because my husband was emotionally and physically abusive man who constantly cheated on me, lied to me, was a passive aggressive crazy maker and had a serious pornography addiction.My ten year old twin daughters are court-ordered to visit their father every other weekend, even though they do not want to see him they have to. He constantly interrogates them about me and tells them untruthful and horrible things about me, he also tells them things about my distant past and things that I have done during a rebellious time in my life-things that I have long since repented of and resolved I my life. He tries to tear me down and degrade me and make me into a monster so that my daughters will hate me. I have tried to talk to him about the damaging effects he is having on the self worth of the twins by talking, emailing him, taking a co-parenting class, taking him to court, filed restraining orders and read self help books and I just keep hitting brick walls trying to deal with his constant destructive behavior. Talking to him is like trying to reason with a four year old narcissist. The court does not consider him abusive enough to end visitation. my daughters are becoming ill when they know they have to see him-they beg me to not make them visit him, they are becoming depressed. how can I prove that they are being emotionally damaged by this cruel selfish man? How can I prove he is unstable and abusive?
