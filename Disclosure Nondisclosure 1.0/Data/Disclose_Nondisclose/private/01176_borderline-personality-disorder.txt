My sister (24) has 'said' (sorry i have no proof and she has been known to compulsively lie/make things up) for the last 3 years she has BPD.The things she has done over this time have been aimed at my family and since they have stepped back are now targetted at me, it has destroyed our family which used to be really close. She has said her medical profession (psychologist the person who diagnosed her) says she is under control and i have never seen her medicated on anything legal, this doesn't help :S. But I think she is lying and not even talking to anyone anymore i don't think she needs to be medicated she only lashes out at me. Since we live together in a share house and my family kind of pushed me away when i let her live with me i just have no where else to go. All the treatments i have read about seem boring and childish, almost stupid its hard enough she would just laugh in my face and make things worse. Is there anything for this age group i have missed and i would like to find a support group for me to
 sorry for the essay 
i hope there are other options
p.s. please don't tell me to move out of the toxic situation i am in october but i am a full time student and i work (and i don't sleep anymore) and can't before then money is a problem, so it trying to find a good support system
