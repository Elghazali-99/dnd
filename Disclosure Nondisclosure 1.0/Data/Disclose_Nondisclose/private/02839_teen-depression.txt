i am 17 years old, and a senior in high school. i was with a boy, jeffrey, for 14 months. he moved in with me and my parents last April. he was part of the family! my mom loved him, and my dad did, and my sisters and brother in laws did as well. it felt so right. he would sleep on the couch, and i'd sleep in my bed, and he'd go spend the night with my grandma so we could have some time alone. i was inlove with him. he asked me to promise myself to him, and gave me a ring. on december 16th, we broke up, and he decided to move out and back to his moms house, which is about an hour away. i begged him to come back, and he refused. time went on, and i slowly got over it. he started doing drugs, and hanging out with a bad crowd, and even speaking differently. he is NOT the boy i fell in love with, but i still love that boy. i've become so much closer to God and i have so much faith. i believe that he was made for me, and everyone tells me that he still thinks of me. he writes blogs about how he doesn't care about me on his myspace, and he writes about how he wants love, and he always stares at me when he see's me in public, with my friends. he just won't have a conversation with me. any advice?
