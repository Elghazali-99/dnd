I need some help, I'm 26 years old and I have a 3 and a half year old daughter. For some reason ever since I had my baby my vagina doesn't get as wet as it use it. It's actually quite dry! I use to be able to get super wet even before having sex to the point that it would drip down my thighs before we even got started. Now I have to give my bf head with a lot of saliva before he puts it in and a few minutes after we start the saliva and my vagina dry up. I'm 100% completely turned on so that's not the problem. I don't want to use lube. I want to be able to produce my own natural wetness like I was able to before. I'm only 26! I've tried slippery elm powder, maca root powder, flax seed, and chia seeds... I usually will take a table spoon of each and mix them in a smoothie but it hasn't really helped. I've also recently been taking dr. Sebi's estro pills which are supposed to help With dryness and increase your sexual appetite, but I've taken 4 pills a day for about 7 or 8 days now and there is no difference in my vaginal fluids and ive actually had no sexual desire whatsoever since taking them which is unusual for me because I've never had a problem getting horny or turned on. I'm considering trying the estrogen ring or estrogen creams or tablets, don't know what else to do. Has anybody tried anything else that has worked for them??? Has anyone used estrogen creams, tablets or the ring??? Can you get them without insurance??? Please help!
