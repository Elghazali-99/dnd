I posted something before about how my girlfriend has cheated on me... i felt better with all the support but im still crying almost everyday and i can't stop thinking about it... and still i have trouble trusting people i yell at people i don't trust or i would keep quiet when they're talking to me... even the teachers sometimes i wont answer them or i would yell at them... having tourettes doesn't help either my tourettes is OCD and when something is not in the right place (for example the papers are not stapled correctly) i cry i just can't help it and the teachers yell at me and think OCD is not a real disability and that i can't help it they always say "grow up why are you crying over this" (I'm in 8th grade) and they always makes fun of me... and i was about to beat the **** out of anyone who brings up how my girlfriend cheated on me in school but i hold it back, i trust only about 2 people in my school... i don't even trust most of my friends... nothing and no one is helping me with depression... and two weeks later i got beat up by a racist gang of skin heads, thats deffenitly is going to help me... i can't go to school without being scared now cause most of the white kids shaved their heads ( except my friends)... who is there two trust... girls can't be trusted so i guess i'll never be in love again and get married cause they'll just cheat on you with another guy, are all girls like this? Also most people can't be trusted...i tried everything from medicine to counsler to talking to my own parents nothing is working i need more suggestions to help me i cant take is anymore...
