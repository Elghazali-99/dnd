My son is 6. He has been diagnosed mood disorder, ODD and ADHD. He has been on meds since he was 3. He has taken just about every pill they make. None work. Either they make him crazier or they have horrible side effects. He has been hospitalized twice. He just came home yesterday from a 3 week stay in a mental hospital. The first day he was there they started him on Zyprexa. By the time he came home they were giving him 10mg 3 times a day! I had no idea how high a dose this was. When I took the prescription to the pharmacy they wouldn't fill it without talking to his doctor. They said the dose was excessive. I found out that this is the dose they would give to a 300lb adult, not to a 45lb little boy. 
When I took James to his regular doctor today he immediately took him off Zyprexa. He warned me to watch for anything unusual and take him to the hospital. I don't want him on anything but I have been told it's not my choice anymore. When he is off meds he is extremely violent, aggressive, and has fits of rage with no rational trigger. Yet on meds he is not much better. 
My 6 year old has been on everything and Zyprexa was supposed to be the miracle drug! Now I am told it could have made him way worse. 
Does anyone have a child like mine?
