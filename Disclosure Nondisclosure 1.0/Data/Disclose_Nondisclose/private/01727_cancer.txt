Hello,
Please I'm desperate, angry, sad, my father who is almost 76 , I know he's up there already , recently develop multiple myeloma . He already had the cell that easily could of turn to this awful cancer at anytime. Well this Saturday he sustained a fall and fractured his lower back an L2 is what they found . Amongst more detail observation they saw that there was apparent bone disintegration. They did blood work to determine and yes sad and horrible he has it! I've been to the hospital off an on with him since he got sick . Just to let you know amongst his other illness he has chronic kidney failure . He's currently in dialysis. Today his hemoglobin was at 7%? Point to this he will be given blood transfusion this Saturday while on dialysis. Please , anyone I love my father and it's killing me to see him go through this.
I ask of you anyone who's going through awful myeloma or knows someone to give me an answer on what will be the next step for him? I know he's getting a bone marrow biopsy the following week . To see the severity of the myeloma . He's in a lot of pain his back is killing him literally. Is there treatment ? Will they give him something? I know again that age is a factor and it varies differently in people's chemistry. But will he find any comfort from pain? They prescribe norco which is not doing anything for him . I suggested morphine or steroids . Please again anyone who's going through , please let me know asap . Just to get a piece of mind.
Thank you ,
Sincerely
