Well.. I'll start here, To begin, My life has been pretty crappy so far, I'm 16. and Somethings been happening for the past 3 years, that I honestly don't wanna mention, And due to what happened I had to move in with my grandparents, Well, My grandfather has a temper issue that he "Supposly" is trying to control, yet I see no changes. and When something happens that he doesn't like, he gets mad and starts yelling at me at my grandmother, and when I tell him to chill or something he gets mad at me for being a Smart *** Excuse my language, And that ticks me off because he gets in my face and says f*** you to me and everything else to my face. which then really ticks me off, I'm a pretty happy out going person, but with these past three years, Its been really depressing and what he does just makes it so much worse. Not to long ago, I've even drawn a Japanese sword, on him, Of course it isn't sharp and of course I didn't hit him, But what he was doing then, It made me really just wanna slice him. And during last Halloween we had candy, And hes diabetic, so of course he can't have alot of it, and he eats alot of candy cause he took a bag just for himself and put it in a bowl, Now later on that day I hid it and he gets mad and starts yelling and carrying on about it, That was the day I drew the sword, Now as for today, The cable was out and he was yelling and mad about it, Not like me and my grandmother did anything to it, The cable company was having problems, and I told him to calm down and chill shes taking care of it, and about 5 mins after that hes telling me "F*** you don't tell me to chill in my own F***ing house" which right there made me wanna just lay his freaking butt down, When It comes to my anger I have it pretty under control, but when someone gets on my bad side, I'll go all out. To be honest, I don't know what might happen if he ticks me off again, because I'm at a point where I'm about to say screw it and beat him down. A few people have said I need anger management, Which I think is a load of bull, I'm a really fun and happy person to be around exept when someone gets in my face thinking that just because there an "Adult" then can do whatever the hell they want. My life has always been hell, My mother called the cops on me so many times cause I got "Out of control" when her and her stupid *** boyfriend ticked me off, the cops told me that if they had to come out again, I go to juve, which right there, always made me hate my mother, and to this day, because of whats happened these past 3 years, I honestly hate her, and almost everyone around me, To be honest I feel as if my life is just Despair, to me my only family is my cards, I play yugioh which is joyful to me, to me, my cards are my only family. Right now, I don't hit him for one reason and I try to stay calm for one reason, I have a friend who's almost like my true brother, He got me this Quincy Cross which tells me when I'm mad to stay calm and think of what my friend would tell me. Which right there tells me to calm down and not do what I really wanna do, which is beat everyone around me to a living pulp. As for now, I don't know what I might do next when people make me really mad, All I can do is bottle my anger and just go on with my life is how I feel, My only question is, Any suggestions on how to control my anger when someone does something like my grandfather does to me.
