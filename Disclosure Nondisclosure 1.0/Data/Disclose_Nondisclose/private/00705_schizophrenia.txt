I have posted questions on BPD & Relationship Forums and people asked me to share my problems. This is one of the major problems of my life, the reason I can't bring close friends at home, I can't bring guest, the reason why I am being called back home 10 min. after I leave...etc.
 I live in Asia where people suffer acute financial problems. The treatment of Autistic and Mental Patients are generally costly. I have an autistic bro of 14 and it's like I was born to witness mental patients and their sufferings. My uncle on my mom's side is a Schizophrenic. I used to see him get violent. I used to see my other uncles beat him up not knowing the consequences. When I was 4 my bro was born. It was fun to have him but when he was 2 and a half he was diagnosed with Autism. We didn't know anything about that disease. Later when we learned enough about it, it was too late. We could train him about some basic behaves but he can't talk, he's not properly toilet trained. 
 My mother developed Paranoia 8 years ago but at that time we did not really notice anything serious. She was suspcious of my father and that caused a lot of controversy in our conservative family. The controversy over-shadowed the disease. 5 years earlier she was diagonised and after a violent outbreak she was hospitalised forcibly. It was a rough night and still scares me.
 Now the tremor has somehow started again. The hardest part is, we can't get her to visit psychiatrist. She won't understand. She won't go. i wanna die. I can't find a way out. What do i do???
