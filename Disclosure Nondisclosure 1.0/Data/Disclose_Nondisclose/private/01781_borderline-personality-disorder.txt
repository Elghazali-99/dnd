I recently left a bad relationship that lasted two years. In order to do just that I had 2 choices, move back to my hometown where I wouldn't make progress of any kind. Or Move back in with my mother. I chose mom. We had an agreement That I would pay 1/3rd of the bills, buy my own grocries and help with housework. Basic roommate agreements. Long story short Im living with my mother whom i belive to have a personality disorder. She has never been treated or diagnosed. But after doing a little research she might fall under Narcissistic personality disorder. Either way i am miserible dealing with the constant nurturing of her self esteem, always listining to her problems , and having to live my life behind her back for fear of a shrill opposistion to whatever im doing.
     I know im not a bad roommate. i  pay my bills on time and go to work. But I will admit I gave up on the housework recently only because every time i would clean she would mess it up with in minutes ( sometimes when i was in the middle of cleaning) and accuse me of never doing it. She is constantly screaming at me. Anyways I need some insight on personality disorders and maybe some advise on how to cope with it.  I cannot move because of money issues.  Its has starting to affect my well-being. Please help.
