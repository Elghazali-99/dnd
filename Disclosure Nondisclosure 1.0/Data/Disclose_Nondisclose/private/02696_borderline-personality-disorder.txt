When I was younger, I was convinced that there was something inately wrong with me.  Perhaps I had just been born to fail and disappoint my mother.  But as I grew older, a teenager, I began to recognize inconsistancies.  Sometimes she would brag to everyone who would listen about how smart/funny/successful I was and other times it was as though she hated me.  I took care of her and sometimes it was really validating to fix a problem.  She needed me.  But I got to the point where I didn't think she even saw me or anyone else as a real person.  She seemed to think that she felt things more than other people, stronger.  Others didn't have the emotional depth that she had.
She fluctuated between being a compotent woman, capable of taking care of herself and berating me constantly to a helpless childlike persona, going so far as to speak in a different voice, high and soft, and acting as though she couldn't do anything and crying helplessly when confronted with a problem.
After being hateful and degrading towards, sometimes just an hour later she would act as though nothing had happened, without apology or acknowledgement.  Several times I confronted her about things she said or did and I really believe that she didnt think she did those things.  
After a final straw, I ended my relationship with her.  I stated if all she wanted to tell me was what a disappointed I was and how ashamed I made her, she could say it to someone else.  That was six months ago.  I am trying to come to grips with the fact she will never be the person I want her to be, but that doesn't mean I don't want help for her.
I understand this is common for children of BPD Parents but its what I want.
What would be the best way for me to get help for her?  Confrontation? Child Services(I have younger siblings)?
I believe she has BPD and I understand its treatable.
