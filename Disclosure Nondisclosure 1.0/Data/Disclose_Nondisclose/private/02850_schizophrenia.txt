I have been conversing online with a guy who came back from Nam with violent nightmares, but also the beliefs that he is a prophet specially chosen by God to carry a message that sin does not exist in God's eyes (he has rationalized killing during war to be God's will, as is all crimes committed).  He says he is capable of mind control and telepathy, though stops short of saying he hears auditory hallucinations.  The hospital that his wife put him in diagnosed it as schizophrenia, then after a second evaluation in the 1980's, they said it was 25% PTSD.  He does not believe he is schizophrenic at all, though I understand that many of those who suffer from this are in denial, and skip the medications.  He currently only takes 1 med to help him sleep, and seems afraid to take anything else, as it will "disrupt" his purpose of being God's chosen one.  He has been shunned by both his church and his family because of this.
 Any advice?  Do schizophrenics believe they are telepathic?
