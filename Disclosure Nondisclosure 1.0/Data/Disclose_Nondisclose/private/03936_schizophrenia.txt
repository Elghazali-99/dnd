I have anxiety in social situatons.
I act shy and withdrawn around others.
I tend not to talk spontaneously.
 I did a test and I was high schizotypal and very high avoident.
 One thing I am worried about as I don't know what it is, is:
I'm always acting as if one of my teachers were watching me. It's a teacher I really trust. I don't fancy her, I'm not a lez. I just like her and trust her. So I always think that she is watching me. I know she isn't but in my room I think she is watching either through the webcam on my laptop or my window, in the kitchen it is the window, in the living room it's from the house over the road. All the time it is in the windows it is when it is dark and I can''t see out. I know she isn't watching me but I just act as if she was. Just like how I act. So I have been doing loads of revision of her lesson and talk about her all the time. I just trust her so much. I think I sort of want her to see me ouside of school like maybe foster me or something. I'm not in care but I have always wanted to be and now I'm always thinking about what it would be like to live with her and her husband. Like I would be there foster daughter. But I know that that isn't ever going to happen. But I want it to.
 So that's what I'm worried about. I can't tell anyone this as they would think I was a freak. I am getting counselling soon for self harm and bad behaviour asnd that but I don't want to be telling people about my personal thoughts. Do you know what this could be? Please comment if you have any idea at all.
 Thanks.
