It seems like I will look to anything for a cure to my addiction problems. I started out on methadone. Then I quit and went through withdrawals for 8 weeks. Then I went to Kratom to help me through the pain with what I was dealing with in my life and then I quit that after 10 months of abuse. Now I drink a lot and do pills on occasion (like once every 3 months) the drinking is my big problem. I do pills then I w/d for a week and while I w/d I drink or find other substances (like alcohol) to abuse, I am trying to take adipex to lose weight and I keep getting fake drugs offline. I am w/d from pills this week and next week I am not sure what I'll do. I don't want to be dependent on any kind of substance anymore. I turn to anything to make me feel better and I am not sure what to do. How do I become completely sober? I took 5HTP for months after I quit Kratom and I loved it, but now it does nothing. I want to be free of my addictive personality. NA is not possible due to my hours and I stay of pills unless they are around. ---Which they just were for 3 weeks.- And I am w/d now. How have others come off of everything? I know others write to this forum and make friends that help. Can someone please help me? At least be a friend?
