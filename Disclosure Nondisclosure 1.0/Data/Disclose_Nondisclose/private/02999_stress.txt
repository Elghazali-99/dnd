Hi everyone. I guess I just really need to vent. I have anxiety/panic disorder now for almost 20 years. I have been through help and back with it. Always thinking I was sick etc... when my anxiety is under control I feel wonderful...
Lately though I would say the past 6-7 months. I have been feeling horrible, and it is not a anxiety feeling. It is a feeling of being physically sick. My blood work is weird. I'm slightly anemic, I swear I have thyroid problems and doc thinks I also have fibromyalgia . I just feel sick like I said and not anxiety sick. I have to see so many specialists to rule things out...Lupus, Lyme, Thyroid , Fibro..even a hematologist... but my family and friends could care less. And I'm not saying that to feel sorry for myself. They literally could care less. Every single thing I feel to them, is anxiety. Always will be. I tell them I don't feel good, they roll the eyes, huff and puff and say "whatever". I tell them everything I feel, how sick I feel and there like, oh well do what ya gotta do...like Wtf? How can people be so cruel. I have no-one to lean on. My husband is so sick of it. He doesn't want to hear it. What do I do..what would you do
..I keep going to the docs and getting nowhere...
