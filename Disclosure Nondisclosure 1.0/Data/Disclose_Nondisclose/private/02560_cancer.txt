Background: I am a 31 year old female. I have had asthma since age 3 and have been exposed to 2nd hand smoke for the duration of my 31 years, however never smoked myself. I've had what we thought was bronchitis for a few months. Been through several antibiotics which would work for a wekk or two and then symptoms would immediately return. Chest x-ray showed nothing extraordinary, blood work had high Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (31), high platelets (477), high neutrophilis ANC (11.37), high % neutrophils (80.4), low % monocytes (2.1), low potassium (3.5), and low vitamin d (12.1). Doctor said nothing overly concerning and we would re-do blood work in 6 months. In the meantime I went for my 6 month appointment with pulmonologist for routine asthma check, he re-did blood work (1 month after 1st round), and also ordered a CT scan of chest. CT scan showed a 5mm nodule on lower right lobe. Blood work now shows platelets slightly lower but still high (449), Neutrophils ANC 7.93, % Neutrophils (75), % Eosinophils (.5), and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (>80). Pulmonologist ordered a PET scan which I will have next week. I've read a lot of things on Google, however, nothing really describes anything that it could be. So my question is, what COULD it be?
