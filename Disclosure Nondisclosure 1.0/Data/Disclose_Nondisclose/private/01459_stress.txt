Over a year ago I started stressing out over the health of my wife. She was in the hospital in intensive care for heart problems. While dealing with this I came in contact with someones blood on the job. They had HIV and I was convinced that I contracted it. I was having cold sweats and fainting spells. I couldn't get it out of my head. Between my wifes problems my anxiety I was coming up with all kinds of health problems. Around May I got garden variety jock itch. The problem is it caused the area to develop chronic eczema. Now I have been trying to deal with that. I was tested for all kinds of things and all came back negative. But this rash persists. I can't stop thinking about it, worrying it's going to get worse and never go away. The rash gets better at night and worse when I wake up and start thinking about it. None of the medication the dermatologists have given me do anything. I am worried I am going to lose my job and house all over a rash that won't go away. The rash makes it difficult to work because I walk a lot.
I tried to get phsycological help but that didn't work.
I am only 43 and feel as if my life is over.
