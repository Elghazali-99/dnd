So, I started dating an old friend almost a year ago and she and her kids moved in about 4 months ago. Short background-- I grew up wrestling/rough housing with my dad and have done so with my 3 kids(all girls) and my gf's kids.(1 girl and 2 boys)  They love it and enjoy the interactivity.  Recent-- Lately though, her daughter has been asking for a lot of piggy back rides which I give to all of them but she will deliberately get loose and start falling so that my hands touch her privates.  I have stopped giving them after i noticed a pattern forming and became uncomfortable.  I didn't say anything to the mom as I didn't want to look like a creepo or molester. A new thing though it that she has become scared of her room which hasn't been an issue in the first 3 months she was here.  First it was a closet with no door, then it was not enough light and now she doesn't want to sleep alone.  Her mom usually puts her to bed but she tries to get me to bring her most nights.  Which isn't a problem since her mom is home every night to put her to bed except when friends call to get together. The last time i put her to bed when mom was out is prob the last time ever.  She tried to pull me on top of her with her legs apart and she kept trying to kiss me to which I kept telling her was very inappropriate.  I asked her mom what she does on her tablet and we checked her viewing and found her watching videos about pregnancy and big bellies among cartoons and normal things.... Mom took her tablet away.  She lives here all week and sees her dad who has a male roommate on the weekend.  I don't want to insinuate anything but I think something may have happened or is wrong... I dont know where to start with talking with mom and I have tried to ask the kid if anything was wrong.  Am I in the wrong to do anything?? Shes 6 turning 7 soon. Please help.
