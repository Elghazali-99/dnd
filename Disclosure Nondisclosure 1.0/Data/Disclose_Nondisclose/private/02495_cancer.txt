One my relative is identified with Multi Skeletal Metastatis and the primary spot is identified as Lungs.
 Doctor said he is in stage IV but not answering how long he will survive.
 Below are reports.
 PET SCAN :
 Thorax : Increased FDG uptake is seen in the enlarged subaortic (SUV max 2.6) Subacrinal (SUV Max 3.4) and Left hilar (SUV Max 3.6) nodes
 Increased FDG uptake is seen in the subpleural nodular opacity in the left low lobe (SUV max 6.8)
 Abdomen and Pelvis : FDG distribution in the bowel loops is in a physiological pattern
 Bone : Increased FDG uptake is seen in the destructive lytic with soft tissue component in the right iliac bone (SUV Max 10.0) infiltrating the adjacent gluteus muscle.
 Increased FDG uptake is seen in the lytic lesion in spinous process of L4 (SUV max 6.8) and body of D3(SUV max 8) vertebrae.
 PET CT Impression :
 1. Hypermetabolic Mass in left lower lobe with adjoining consolidation
2. Hypermetabolic mediastinal and left hilar nodes
3. Hypermetabolic skeletal metastatses
4. No other significant metabolically active disease in the whole body survey
 Is he really in stage IV and what is the life expectancy on an average for this type of report ?
