Hi everyone.  I am wondering if depression can cause a person to have physical symptoms (feeling sick).  I am asking this in regards to my 24 year old son.  He has been diagnosed with OCD and is on 40mg Latuda, 0.05mg Klonopin, and 300mg Anafranil.  For the past few weeks he has felt more sleepy and a lack of appetite, but not every day, until last week.  A little over a week ago he started sleeping 15 to 18 hours a day (and still feeling tired after waking), was feeling nauseous (with some throwing up and a lot of dry heaves), loss of appetite and lightheadedness.  Brought him to 3 different E.R., whereas the third hospital admitted him for 3 days, thinking it was some type of gastro-intestinal virus. He did improve while in the hospital, appetite came back, stomach ache gone, lightheadedness gone.  I brought him home yesterday afternoon and within two hours of being home, was feeling the extreme sleepiness again. It came on so suddenly.  Has anyone ever experienced physical illness while depressed? And he tells me it could not be depression because he has nothing to be depressed about. By the way, he does isolate himself in the house and does not have any friends, but says he does not feel depressed.  I am just looking for some answers and insight (he has been sleeping all day so far and it is 5:00 pm now). After the hospital did all sorts of tests, could not find anything wrong physically with him. Thanks for listening.
