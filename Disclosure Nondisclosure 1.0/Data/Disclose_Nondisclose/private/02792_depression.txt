met a girl online and we texted for a week, and then we then met and had a real good time.we didnt make out or do anything sexual, we just talked and hung out and I gave her a big hug when we went our ways. We continued texting and she would text me while i was working saying "i miss you" or" please get off work!"...she also said i make her smile and that I was a sweet guy and couldnt wait to see me again.It looked like we were gonna be dating. we had planned on meeting twice the next week
 Well I found out she met another guy and was interested in him. She was saying she had no idea what to do because she felt horrible about the situation.
 well last night she let me know that she was gonna see the other guy. she said they just had a better chemisty than her and i. she said we had a good chemistry but just not as good, and that it was easier for her to see him(he lives in the same town, i'm 20 mins apart)
 she said she was sorry and felt bad. i told her it was her choice and no hard feelings
 and i'm not mad at her but i feel like crap. pretty much she told me"i like him better than you" i feel like i'm a failure and i keep wondering what could i have done to improve my chances. 
 i could have kissed her good bye, made myself clearer on my intentions( i was afraid i would come off as desperate) could have talked to her on the phone(she called one night but i was in bed, had to be at work in 6 hours and wanted to sleep)
 i don't know..i just feel like crap....getting picked over *****
 i still feel bad though bout myself...what do i do
