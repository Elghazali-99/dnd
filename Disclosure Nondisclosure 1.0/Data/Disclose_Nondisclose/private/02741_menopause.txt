I am 55 years old and last menses was in 2010.  I struggled with perimenopause for about ten years and was actually glad to finally reach menopause at age 52 because at least there would be an end to the periods.  I did not have a hysterectomy.  
 The hot flashes weren't too bad, but the headaches, dizziness and occasional weakness were miserable, not to mention no libido and no patience.  I am also a hypothyroid patient too, which doesn't help the situation any since many of the symptoms can be interchangeable.
 Anyway, I was started on bioidentical hormone replacement therapy almost one month ago, using an Estradiol patch, Estriol suppositories and progesterone orally.  I have noticed an alleviation of my menopause symptoms such as the migraine headache and hot flashes but since my thyroid levels are still not where they should be, I haven't been feeling well yet.  I've heard this can take some time, so I'm willing to be patient.  
 Here's my question:  Has anyone had issues with spotting when starting BHRT?  The spotting started two days ago and it is more like the end of a period, nothing bright red.  I'm going to call the nurse practitioner tomorrow, but am curious if anyone else had this happen when starting BHRT.  If it's simply a matter of my body adjusting, I'll calm down, lol.  
 The worst part is I've noticed some spotting, nothing like a period, but still enough to unsettle me
