Hello everybody - 
 I'm just posting here because I am really confused about what is going on with my menstrual periods at the moment, and thought someone here might be able to help!
 I used to always have a 32 day cycle, bleed for 5 days, and that's it.  A few months ago, all that suddenly changed when I had a 53 day cycle, which has never happened before.  I bled for the normal 5 days after that, and then the next month was kind of normal again.  The cycle after that, however, I had mid-cycle bleeding, which I have never had before, and that kind of continued until it turned into a normal period.  However the period carried on for 3 weeks, until I went to see the doctor, and she gave me some tablets to stop the bleeding.  Now I have just had a 42 day cycle, and the bleeding this last period has been heavier than ever - flooding and clots so bad I couldn't leave the house at times.  I had some of the tablets left from before, so I have taken them again to stop the bleeding.
 I plan to see the doctor again once the bleeding has stopped (I still have some light bleeding), as she said last time she would do an internal exam but not whilst I was bleeding, but I just wondered if anyone else on here had experienced this, or has any idea what might be going on?
 I have read that this can be a sign of early menopause, but I am 37, and even though I know it's not impossible, it seems a little young to be beginning the menopause.  Any thoughts?
 Thanks!
Debbie
