Okay so I don't really know where to begin.I'm 15 years old and my life pretty much *****.I've been noticing some changes over the past year but I don't really know how to interpret them.
Firstly, I never eat anymore.I don't think I have an eating disorder I would need to have a poor image of myself and I don't really.I don't care about what I weight.Yeah, i do feel ugly and fat sometimes but it passes.I just never get hungry anymore or thirsty.It's like a numbness I have.When I do eat it's because I know I have to so I just eat a chocolate bar or have a cup of tea.
There are so many that changed like my awareness in school.Sometimes I'm really motivated to do my work and then the next it's an off day so I fail a test or forget my homework.The teachers think I'm lazy because they know I can do the work I'm just not trying but I'm trying to do my best my body just won't let me.When they shout at me it makes me think that maybe there is something wrong with me that I can't perform a simple task.I used to enjoy English but my skills are lacking cause I can't think of how to compose sentences anymore.She says it's disorganised and it doesn't make sense but I don't know how to fix it.
My mum and I got in the worst argument a few months ago so I haven't gone home to her.I live at my dad's house but he's never home so I'm usually by myself all day.You would think I would be able to do a simple task like cleaning the dishes in the space of 15 hours but no.
I don't sleep anymore, I don't feel tired for example it's 3:14 am and I'll probably sleep a total of 3 hours but I'll lie in bed all day and walk about in my pj's.Then there will be days where I can't physically move out of bed so I just lay there and I could probably sleep more than 16 hours straight but that's my record so far.
Everything I used to enjoy seems stupid now music, work and even photography.Music is probably one of the biggest things to lose interest in because I absolutely loved collecting vinyl and playing the guitars and stuff like that.I've given up on a lot of my friends too I just can't keep up.
I rarely shower now which is really gross I know.When I do shower it's brief I don't even shave or anything.I used to get my hair done a lot but now I don't care, to be honest.
When I'm out in public I don't talk to anyone or me talk too much to my friends which are down to two of.I don't even cry anymore, I don't laugh I don't have any expressions.
when I'm having a conversation I am never able to stick to the one topic I have to talk about something else because it popped into my head.
