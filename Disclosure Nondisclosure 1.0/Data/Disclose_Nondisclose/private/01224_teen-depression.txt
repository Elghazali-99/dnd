This is going to be long and sound really stupid, but here goes-
   I am 16 years old and I was diagnosed with psychotic depression last year after I attempted suicide. Even though I have been on medications for nearly nine months, I still have suicidal thoughts and idealizations, I still have desires to hurt myself, and I still hear voices in my head/have hallucinations. Unfortunately, I think my condition is getting worse. I feel like I am two different people, a sad, sobby, depressed person, and an enraged, murderous psychopath. I cry over the simplest, stupidest things, and also have terrifying "flare ups" of uncontrolled rage. And this happens every day. I'm so scared- I feel like I'm  out of control. I feel like other things are controlling me/i'm being posessed. Sometimes I have breakdowns and do things like completely trash my bedroom, and this anger like no other takes over, and I feel like I want to murder someome. I'm afraid of just snapping in public (I've come close many times), and just start destroying everything in sight, and possibly hurting people. I feel like i'm walking on a rickety old bridge that might just crack at any moment. I also have severe paranoia and my brain seems to be someone else- sometimes she talks to me inside my head, saying stuff like, for example, "You stupid girl! Why did you do that?" or "Why don't you eat this for dinner?" I know it's hard to explain and it seems so wierd, but I don't know what to do now and I feel like I have absolutely no control over what goes on in my head. I also tend to "narrate" what I'm doing past-tense inside my head. For example- I'll be walking up the stairs and down the hall, and while I'm doing it, I'll think "I walked up the stairs and down the hall."  I don't know. I'm just so afraid of myself, and what I might do- It's so unpredictable. What do you think?
