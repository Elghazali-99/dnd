My period is about 8 days late now. My cycles all along have been hovering between 28-32 days and have never missed my period. I've turned 41 only recently about less than 3 months ago, and have been TTC for the past 5 months, and had 2 very early miscarriages at the beginning of first 2 months (heavy symptoms then suddenly disappear and started to bleed that include clumps).
 Last month, in October, we finally tried an ovulation kit, found I am ovulating (LH surge) and TTC thereafter. When I missed my period I thought maybe I'm pregnant because I get these symptoms of tender breasts, feeling slightly warm all over (face not having hot rashes), feeling tired. I took HPT x 2, once about 6 days late and the second when 7 days late, both came out negative.
 I'm beginning to suspect I'm going through menopause, although I've seen my Chinese Physician and he said its normally too early for menopause, that 1 week late in period may not mean it detectable and advised that I should wait another 3 weeks to test again for pregnancy, if I don't get a +ve then I should get a check up with a GP.
 What I'm curious is since I ovulated, is it possible to hit menopause straight away? My breast tender symptoms are now almost gone. I suspect I am indeed not pregnant, the thought that any chance of TTC is gone really aches so bad - is there really no hope anymore?
 I'm so confused, stressed and sad - yet, I'm not sure if it is true like he said I need to wait to test for sure - then being this upset might just encourage a miscarriage if I do turn out pregnant. I don't know what to do, anyone can advise here? Thank you.
