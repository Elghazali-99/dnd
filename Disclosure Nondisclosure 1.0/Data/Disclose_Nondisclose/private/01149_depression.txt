I have Complex PTSD and major depression. I have been through Celexa, Zoloft, and then Wellbutrin. 
I am 21 years old, relatively fit, female. 
 Celexa and Zoloft, I felt fatigued more, irritable, and had suicidal thoughts.
 Then I went to try Wellbutrin.....first the first week I couldn't eat a thing but I also felt very happy and more rational. I thought it was perfect. Then I was studying for an oral exam and experienced anxiety, then I start to spasm. My chest at first jerked upward and then my right arm started to shake uncontrollably. This went on for TEN days without relief, it was so tiring and humiliating. It was so horrible and painful. My heart was overexerted. I started to experience panic attacks for the first time in my life. 
I went to the ER the first night this happened and all they did was put me on Ativan and send me home, all the while the shaking went on for over a week after this. My doctor gave me Propanalol for my heart pain. He didn't believe Wellbutrin was the cause, maybe he's just covering his ***. But I remember how wonderful I felt before this happened. He put me back on Zoloft...but I don't even bother with it anymore. It doesn't help.
 I really want a decent antidepressant. I feel like I can't win.
