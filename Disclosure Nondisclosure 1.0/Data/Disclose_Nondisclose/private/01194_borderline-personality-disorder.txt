I have been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with borderline personality traits (she said she doesn't want to call it "disorder"  but still that's what it is). The older I get, the harder it is to get along with other people. It interferes with my holding down a job. I take everything personally and get mad and get my feelings hurt all the time. I either hate someone or like them, no in between. How is someone supposed to keep a job? Working is just another stressful event. I also have recurrent major depression, anxiety disorder, and "possible bipolar type 2." No matter what meds I take, I still can't get along with people unless they are very patient and understanding and nice to me. I hate my life. I was laid off work 6 months ago and haven't been able to either look for work, or if I have had an interview, I never get the job. Nobody likes me. I know I come across as weird, I can tell by peoples' reactions. It wasn't like this when I was younger, it just gets worse. I don't know what to do.
