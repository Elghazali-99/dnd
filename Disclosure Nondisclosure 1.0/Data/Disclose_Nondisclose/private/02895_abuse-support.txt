I suppose this is emotional abuse.  I wish there were more categories to choose from.  Some of us have have more that one form of abuse.  Anyway, I have been abused in my childhood.  I thought I'd dealt with it and gotten past it, you know the anger and all.  And perhaps I did.  Recently, it has come to my attention that although I may have gotten past the anger, I haven't done anything to change the impact the past has had on my way of dealing with the world.  I am an underachiever, work as a secretary when I have an advanced degree.  There is a whole lot of negative feelings about what I'm capable of and how I compare to others.  Messed up.  
 Anyway, I have a real hard time remembering things.  I count on others to remember my youth.  I just remember bits and pieces of it.  I have compartmentalized my life to such an extent, that great chucks of it are just missing.  In fact, I'm so good at compartmentalizing that even things that occur fairly recently, I chunk up and hide.  I don't remember names, faces, conversations.  I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this and what did you do/are you doing to  change this?
