I am a hispanic 35 year old male. I always considered myself of a healthy person with health habits, but in the last couple of months my health is going down and my quality of sleep is getting worse. I have a very stressful job that pays well and I can not leave because many of my circustances. I am not married and I don't have any kids, but I have a family to support in my home town. 
In the last couple of months I haven't gone out once with my friends, I keep contact with people outside of work to a minimum and I am keeping my problems to myself, because I think I don't want to worry others and at the same time I have been always very private. I wonder if is depression what is getting to me, or maybe just lack of sleep so I can cope of the demands of my job. Anyway, in the last couple of weeks I started having a consistent dull pain on my left temporal and my left eye is red and my eyes are getting droopy. I wonder if I might have  an stress issue that sleeping can resolve. Today I was prescribed Rozerem so I can sleep better. If my headches continue should I think in seeing a Neurologist?
