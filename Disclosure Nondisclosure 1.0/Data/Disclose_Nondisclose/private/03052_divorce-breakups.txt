Hello all,
 I have been seperated from my wife since Aug, 2008. 
 We have a 5 year old child together. She has since gotten together with another man and has had his baby recently. there is no communication between us. He  Lawyers sent me an e-mail saying that they would proceed with the application of an uncontested divorce if i did not answer them by June 16, 2011, which I did not. 
 The house has been sold, Finance has been dealt with between us, and she has sole custody of our child. she is totally unreasonable and I have tried to communicate with her but no answer. I have also moved on and plan to marry an amazing woman i have met. 
 I have called the local Family Court where the application for seperation/Divorce was filed, back in Nov, 2010. They have had no update on the file and it will expire 1  year after it was first filed. 
 My question is:
 a- Does the court not know anything about the status of the file until the Judge approves and signs the Request for Divorce?
 b- if she has not filed for the Uncontested Divorce as was stated by her lawyers, is there any way I can have the marriage dissolved due to her living with and having another man's baby? 
 I need to move on with my life and start new with my fiance/wife to be.
 Any advice would be great. I have spent tons of money on 2 lawyers and a mediator to no avail.
