I have been with my husband for 27 years. I have three kids(semi grown).  One is out on his own,one in college and one 16 with some special needs. I stayed home and raised my kids and started working part time now that they are older. I have been at this job for the past year.  I sleep on our couch and he has cut me off financially at this point. I don't make enough money to take care of myself.  I really have no one. My family lives halfway across the country and I can't really ask them for help.  I thought I could get through one more year until my youngest graduated but I don't think I can.  I don't even know how I will get to work today because there isn't much gas in the car he left here today.  I only get paid every two weeks and I have another 6 days till payday.  I have been looking for a better job but limited by education and having to be here to pick up my son during the week.   I had to go to the Dr twice this past week so now I'm broke.  There is only anger here at this point. Well anger and resentment.  I am depressed, feeling trapped and don't know where to start.
