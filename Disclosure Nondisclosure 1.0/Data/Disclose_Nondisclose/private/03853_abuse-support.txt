Hi, 
I do not have issues as intense as others here. I am not sure if I am just being paranoid. My spouse for years has been wanting to move to another state in an isolated country area. I read somewhere that this could be a sign of an abuser who tries to isolate his victim. I would have no family or friends there which troubles me greatly. I would say we both had a tendency towards being emotional abusive in terms of not talking to each other or playing little mind games, but we cut that out completely months back when we discussed things like adults.
 Of all the years together, we had 1 incident, where I antagonized my spouse after he harasseed me about some household thing end result he swung around to sock me on the arm after I had pinched him..then I retailiated & hit him with a phone which he then went off his rocker to strike me with it but didnt. It was ugly and we both had much remorse and talked about it and have not repeated this since. This was 6 months ago.
 Even so, I am worried about my 1st question about moving and is this a sign of someone who wants to abuse. My spouse was a country boy to begin with and complains how he hates city life.
 thank you
