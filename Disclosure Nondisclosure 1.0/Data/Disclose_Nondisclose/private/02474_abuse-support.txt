I have a beautiful and bright daughter who was abused by my brother ( he was prosecuted) the abuse consisted of photographing her after he pulled down panties while she slept and there was never much more to it than that. That was eight years ago and she uses this as an excuse for everything from "thats why I can't do my homework" to why she didn't do simple chores. She is extremely lazy and claims PTDS  but when we catch her at 4:00 AM "Role Playing" on her computer with her toxic friend from school....we're pretty sure she is just too tired because of a lack of sleep. Frankly I'm sick of the excuses.And it only seems to come up when she needs it to. I think we have created this monster....I got to the point that  told her that she needs to spend some time with others who were abused far worse than she. That we were so very lucky that she told someone after a few times of it happening...That it could have been so much worse.....That it wasn't her fault....All the right things.....but now I can't stop myself from trying to get real and say look honey .....what comes out next isn't very nice! I get so angry
