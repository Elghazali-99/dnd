I am 49 and have had 1 to 2 migraines each month before my cycle. In the last 6 months things are going very bad. About 7 to 10 days before my cycle - still having them regularly unfortunately - I feel very tired and weak, get migranes that last up to 6 days in a row, I get very irritated and emotional at the same time - can change hour by hour. This month I have had a Migraine for 6 days. I take Zomig and it helps but the stupid thing keeps coming back. I have been so irritated and so emotional that I sat and cried all day yesterday and actually had suicidal thoughts. Ok wouldn't do it and I know that it is hormonal but still it is like something is controlling my brain and emotions. I have the AC on and then the heater... my face turns bright red and gets very hot and I have night sweats. I can live with most of it accept the migraines and the emotional sadness is overwhelming. The worst part this month is for the first time I got very bad cramps 3 days ago and started then an hour or so later NOTHING! Today I got cramps again with a little bleeding and thought great going to start (because then I know all the symptoms would go away) until next month anyway but no it stopped again. I have been off work all week due to the migraine but the emotional part is just OVER THE TOP... I am not a person who gets irritated or upset easily at all so I feel like I am possessed or something. The only other thing I have noticed is that I never had bad cramps my whole life but in the last 6 months they are severe with heavy bleeding and clotting but other then that I have been regular every 30 days. I see my doctor next week and just hope this is all signs that I am entering Menopause and it will soon be OVER.
