I have been with my common-law spouse approx. 6 years. I own half of our home.  My spouse has a anger problem,
he gets mad, very easily.  If I ask him any questions of anything, he gets defensive and angry.  He has shoved me, many times, and the last time he was charged with assault  He had to leave our our home from approx. 4 months, and then the charges were dropped.  He went to anger management classes for 10 weeks.  He was better for a long time, but after about 8 months, it all is starting over again.  He gets very angry easily, things bother him in the house and he blames me, eg. our pets, two dogs, it they do anything wrong.  He gets angry at my son, and doesn't want him there, He is 18.  He does have many women friends who he contacts by email or texes, he lies alot, about alot of things, and if you question him on anything he gets really angry and usually leaves the house and doesn't come back for hours on end, then I get angry and it starts all over again when he does return.  The last time he hit me really hard. He punched me in my left breast, leaving me hurting and not being able to breathe, well for at least 3 days.  He says he is sorry, and still continues to really blame me, and he doesn't really seems sincere when is says he is sorry, and he things by contacting an ex lover and wishing her a Happy Valentines'd Day, that there is nothing wrong with that?  Am I the crazy one? or is it him and his anger issue?
