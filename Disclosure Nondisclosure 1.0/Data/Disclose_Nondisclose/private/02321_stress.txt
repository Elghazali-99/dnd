For the past 4.5 months Ive been experiencing pressure in my head, mild headaches, visual floaters, some light sensitivity, neck stiffness, and occassional dizziness but not to the point that I feel Im falling. All of these symptoms tend to be more intense while Im at work. Ive had a few incidents where I had to leave because the sensations were too overwhelming. 
 Ive had blood work, MRI of my brain to rule out a tumor, and a recent MRI of my cervical spine which did reveal some bone spurs from C2-T1. I know that nerve impengement can cause similar sypmtoms but the Neurologist doesnt feel my bone spurs are the cause. 
 My question is, if this is all work related stress, would the symptoms disappear when Im not at work? On my days off shouldnt there be complete relief or would the idea of me knowing I have to go back prevent the symptoms from going away completely? I do feel much better when Im not at work and can often feel them becoming more intense when Im there. Even when Im not at work, the pressure and headaches may not be so bad, but the visual floaters have been present since all of this started. 
 Ive never had stress or a history of migraines before so I dont understand how it all works. I know both can cause very similar symptoms and make you feel as though youre falling apart. My job pays really well and I dont want to quit and find something else if its not stress and possibly a result of my cervical spine bone spurs. However, it if is stress related I dont want to risk my health and sanity for any dollar amount, but how can I know?
