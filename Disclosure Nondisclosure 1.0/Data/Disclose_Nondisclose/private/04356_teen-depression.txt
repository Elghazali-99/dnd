I have been going through depression since i was in 5th grade. I am a sophomore in high school now and everything is crashing around me. When i was younger it was mostly just about my looks but now it seems everything is playing a role in my depression. My family, my friends, school, relationships, and especially my looks. I honestly hate everything about me! I am good for nothing in my eyes. I cry my self to sleep almost every night wondering why i just end my life.  I feel like there is nothing for me to live for and that im just taking up space. I know plenty of people have it worse than i do but i still have problems that i have to deal with. I dont really know if my parents know the extent of my depression but i hope they grasp it someday. I havent told them yet about some things, i honestly dont think they can handle it. I burn myself. It's not something i am proud of but it's my escape from the pain even if it is only for about a minute or two. I started doing that about 4 months ago. I haven't been doing it quite as often but i have urges. I started taking medicine and i don't know how to feel about it. I want to be happy but i am scared that it won't work and i will go back into the cycle again. I just don't know what to think. Someone help me!
