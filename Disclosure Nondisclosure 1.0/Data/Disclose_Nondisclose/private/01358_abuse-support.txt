When I say turn the tables, I mean how do I psychologically gain control of her abusive dominance.   
 See, I'm a 30 yr old adult, but for complicated reasons I'm back living with her along with my younger brother.  She is extremely domineering to both of us, and he responds with extreme verbal outbursts and perhaps breaking a flower pot or something about once a week or so.
 See, all my life,  the mantra was "if you don't stop doing this, i'm going to punish you by doing that"... and really truly, looking back, I never really was doing much of anything at all wrong... ie- she constantly invents things to argue about, or she starts irrational/psychotic arguements and then when one of us finally can't stand it anymore and yells back,  she starts boo-hoo'ing and says that "you're killing me,  you're the one who caused me to have to get a pace maker in my heart"...     There's so many levels to her psychotic issues.   Constant chastisement and public reprimanding (for invented reasons) lead me to have extreme self confidence issues in the 18-22 age range when I was first on my own.    Now I don't accept her belittling, ignorant ways and we clash big time with extreme tension,  and the same goes for her and my brother..except his turns into rage.   Really, I don't know where to begin explaining this woman.  There is so much more to it, but the bottom line is,  how do you defeat, or diffuse someone like this?  Other than moving away?
