Some of you may have noticed lately that when you submit a post, you get a message saying "failed to save post".  Apparently, there is a glitch that MH is working on.  MOST times, it affects replies that are lengthy. It has happened with shorter posts as well though, at times.
 I would advise everyone, until this is fixed, "copy" your reply before hitting "post", especially longer posts.  This way, if it doesn't go through, you can "paste" your post without losing all your hard work.  I've noticed, when I get a reply that doesn't go through, when I do it again, I'll break up my reply into multiple posts.  That usually works.
 I know it's a pain, but MH states they are working on it and hope to have it fixed soon.  I wanted everyone to be aware, because I know how frustrating it is to do all that work typing, finding links, etc...only to have it "poof" with the click of the mouse.  Especially if you tend to be "wordy" (which I always am, lol)...it will affect you for sure.
 Actually, it's good practice, glitch or not, to "copy" your replies before submitting them anyway, in case it gets lost somehow.  I know some people choose to draft their replies in a Word type program, then copy/paste it into the reply box.  Thart's a nice safeguard, plus, you have the ability to edit, spell check, etc!
 Thanks for your coperation...and patience.
