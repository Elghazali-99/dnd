Today a dead rotting carcass of a very large Raccoon was removed from under the condomium we rent. The carcass was in a pool of collected water in the crawlspace under the house. The pool of standing water is still there.
 The smell here has been like living in an open sewer or worst. There is also strong mold and mildew smells, mixxed with the other dead carcass smells.  We moved in here a month and a half ago, when it was warm to I kept the windows open but as soon as the weather got colder here in Oregon, I had to close the windows and with the rains, the stench was overpowering.
 Five hours after they removed the carcass, I am still gagging as I can still smell some of the odor. I had a similar gagging experience when I was doing caretaking for my elderly mother and I had to change her diapers. I usually do not gag easily.
 I also have been feeling ill , scratchy throat , congestion  and flu like symptoms. My doctor made me an appointment with an allergist. 
 I read on the CDC that if you smell rotting eggs and there is a carcass in standing water present in a building that you should avoid the gases and leave. 
 So my questions:
1. Is the gagging purely psychological? Or is my body trying to protect me?
2. Is my family living in a hazardous condition being exposed to the fumes, molds and mildews from the fetid standing water underneath our living spaces?
 Please advise.
