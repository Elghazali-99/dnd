I have been married to my husband for six years and we have a son who is five. My husband is always negative about everything and yells at both of us. He asked him why he is stupid a few times and when I try to intervene, he tells me that he wishes I wasn't here and to leave. He yells and puts me down for wanting to talk about money issues and insists that I can't deal with anything on my own. 
My family (mom,dad, aunt, friends) have all asked me why I'm still with him when he is
So selfish. He buys boats and four wheelers and spends a lot of our money fixing them and says he doesn't have time to help around the house cause he's too busy looking after our family!
All I ever buy is food and pay bills, and he says that it's all my fault we are broke.
He also says and does inappropriate things to me in front of our son (grabbing, 'spanking') which kind of hurts and he yells at me and tells me to grow up or go away if I can't take a joke. I usually end up sneaking away and crying because he gets mad if I cry. My son (5) now also spanks me and thinks its funny. I feel this is completely inappropriate.
I'm not sure if I should leave or not. We have been to couples couciling a few times and it does get better for a bit but then it goes back to the same thing with him telling me I should be taking more 'happy' pills
I think I want to leave, I don't want my son to grow up thinking that yelling and being sarcastic and bossing people around are okay and healthy...... I do love him and I don't want to hurt him....but I feel better and happier when he's not around
Am I overreacting?
