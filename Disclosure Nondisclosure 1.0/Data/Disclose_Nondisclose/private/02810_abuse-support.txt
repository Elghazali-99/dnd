My boyfreind is an all around nice guy.  He and I come from completely different backgrounds...which is fine I can deal with that...yet there are somethings that cause me a lot of discomfort...i am a 22 year old female...and everyonce in a while enjoy going out dancing...now mind you i use to go out alot more frequent...yet...in a recent argument with him...he told me he was not happy and i didnt make him happy...the whole reason was this going out thing...i said okay well if I cut it down would that be okay...i m not a bar hopper I go out to dance with my gf's and havea good time...he got absolutely furious and called me stupid and said that iwas the reason he was so mad and i ruined his night...i dont know if it s just me but i always somehow end up apologizing for what i have done...i realize this may sound stupid but its like i get scared when he is mad that he is going to leave...why is that? and is this abuse in any way??? he constantly brings up that he loves me...but then he turn realyl mad at the flip of a dime and can be quite harsh making me feel small...can i solve this??
