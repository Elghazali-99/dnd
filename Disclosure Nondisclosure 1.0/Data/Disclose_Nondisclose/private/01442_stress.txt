As a new college student,I'm finding a lot of new stressful situations.My financial aid is coming in slowly,making my family having to scratch up ways to pay for what is needed during the wait.Along with the financial struggles,I'm an art major,which I'm learning is pretty expensive,considering all of the art supplies I'm having to buy.The professor for my Design I class is demanding and unforgiving,as she is giving us new supplies to buy every week.I have told her that I can't buy some supplies until the weekend,and many times I can't turn in assignments on time - which I'm willing to not get full credit for - and she does not wish to compromise.I also recently got a job,which gives me less free time on my hands.
I'm fine with that,except for the impact it has on my Design class.I usually can buy my supplies only the night before or the morning of the day I have Design class,which made me work all morning to finish my assignment.Now that I have a job during those mornings,I won't have time to finish my assignment in that way.My family is having a hard time getting my supplies this weekend,and I don't think I'll be able to do this assignment at all.I'm stressing terribly,which is making me unable to focus on my Math homework.I need to calm down so I can at least focus on that,but I don't know what I can do.Taking a break every five or less minutes is taking time away for me to finish what I need to do,but that's how often I'm getting too frustrated to continue working on my other homework.
