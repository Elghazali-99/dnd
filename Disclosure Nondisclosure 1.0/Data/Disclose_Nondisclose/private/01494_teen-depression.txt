I currently live with 5 people (my brother, sister-in-law and three nephews), my parents would like for me to move back in with them (mum, dad, brother, sister-in-law, neice, four other brothers, and three sisters). 
 I love my family but I suffer from depression, anxiety, anorexia, suicidal tendencies and insomnia. 
 My 29yr old brother (the one I live with) has very bad anger issues and can be very violent, my sister-in-law suffers depression and anxiety, and one of my nephews suffers ADHD and can also be very violent.
 My 22yr old brother (at my parents house) suffers from a range of different things, my 12yr old sisters has ADHD, my 14yr old sister has an eating disorder and depresion, my 15yr old brother has anger issues and now PTSD due to an accident,my 7yr old brother has depression, my mother has anxiety and depression and my father suffers from depression. 
 I'm a very stressed person all of the time, but I fear that if I keep living where I live then I might end up in the deep end of a river. I also fear that if I move back into my parents then I will, in turn, end up in the deep end of a river.
 Please help...
