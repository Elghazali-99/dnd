My legs and lower back keep jerking when I try to fall asleep. Sometimes it happens in my arms too,but mostly my legs. It feels like the muscles contract abruptly, but it only lasts a second. Sometimes it feels like someone is putting pressure on my lower back. It doesn't hurt, but it is really frustrating and a little startling. It is really starting to stress me out. During the day my knees and thighs feel stiff and sore and when I walk I sometimes get cramps in my calves. Sometimes I notice a little jerk in my knees when they are bent (like when I'm sitting in a chair), or if I'm putting pressure on my leg (like sitting with my elbow resting on my thigh). It started happening after a very stressful event that started interfering my sleep. For a month I was just exhausted and stressed and everything felt sore, it was a miserable month! While I have finally started sleeping better thankfully, I still keep getting these contractions in my legs when I'm about to drift off to sleep. I have never had any health problems, (sometimes my lower back and neck hurt/get occasional headaches but not much else) but I have had a very stressful few months. It it anxiety related? Or is it a lower back/leg problem? I have tried taking magnesium supplements, eating more bananas, getting more exercise, stretching, but I have no idea if anything is helping. I really wish I could get to the bottom of this. It would take such a load off my mind. I just want things to go back to normal!
