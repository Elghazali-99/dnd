Im not to sure if this depression but I will give you what I feel like.
 So I just got back from holidays. I always feel really depressed after holidays for a long time. I just want to go back to where I was and the people I was with.
 I constantly worry about things. Even little things will bother me. I worry about what I am going to do on the weekends. Who is gonna be there, like if it will be people i dont know. I worry about where i will be in 5 years with my life. Will i be in school? What kind of job?
 I wake up in the morning unhappy about my life. I wish I was somewhere else living in another city. I get moments where I hate everyone I know and dont want anything to do with them. I am constantly tired I dont have any energy to do anything, which is why I drink lots of coffee i cant do things unless I have coffee.
 But then other moments, its like everythings gone and i feel fine. I feel quite happy sometimes. But then eventually it all comes back.
 So I dont know if this classifies as depression or not. Or am i just unhappy person that is just unhappy with my life.
 Thanks for taking your time and reading.
