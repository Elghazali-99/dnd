I don't know if stress could cause this but....Recently I have been getting double vision a lot.  It is brief, and is like the two images do a circle before joining back together.  It happens when I open my eyes, or quickly look at  the other side of a room, like my eyes can't focus quickly enough to keep up.  It mostly only happens when I am in class and really tired, so I didn't think much of it, but I have been getting about 7 hours of sleep every night, haven't pulled any all nighters, and it is still happening.  I then thought it may be a psychological thing of "i don't like this class, i don't want to pay attention, here is an excuse..." but I go to UCLA and have always had classes I didn't like but I always paid attention and worked hard in them. It would be very uncharacteristic so I don't think it is that either.   
 When it happens I usually go to sleep, i can't read or pay attention because since things won't focus I blink and then they start their circle thing again making me dizzy.   
 Are there any medications that can cause this?  I take Cymbalta, Welbutrin and Ambien
