if you have been following my story regarding my ex i really need advice now....as i stated i moved 2 hours away from my ex and recently went back to visit and he informed me of jobs out there that are hiring and how he needed a roomte multiple times. well i have been searching for a job everywhere and no luck it is getting to the point that im behind on my bills an really concerned. I have looked every where in the town im living and no luck. I actually heard from a friend that the hospital i applied at when i first moved with my ex is hiring and a few other places too. I didnt know what else to do so i called and the lady who is doing the hiring she remebered me and is going to call me this week for an interview.... so i figured while im down there i will apply for a few other jobs but the catch i would have to be roomates with my ex. I talked to him and he was fine with it he even told me of a few places that were hiring...i told him that if he ever needed to be alone ( hint hint ) i would just go over to a friends house. he replied with what the f**k ever . like he was trying to say that i wouldnt need to do that (i think ). I told him i would probally be down soon to apply for jobs and he told me to let him know. i told him i would call him the following night to talk about it and he said whats to talk about. I thought he might want to talk about since we used to be in a relationship..and when i asked him in the first place he told me how him and a few friends were going for drinks after work and then he is going home early cause he has drill in the morning ( as i stated he is in the Army ) its wiered that he feels like he has to tell me what he is doing detailed like he wants me to know he isnt with another girl ...i dont know . im not sure why he would want his ex as a roomate ...even tho i appreciate it im confused what he really wants ????
