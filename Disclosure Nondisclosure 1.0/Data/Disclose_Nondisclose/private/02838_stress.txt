Before I describe my type of rage, I have had many contributing factors, from post traumatic stress to possible hypothalamic rage, but no doctor or psychologist has ever been able to fully put their foot on what I may have.  I only have one word for it, my Hulk.
 It starts out as an anxiety, the contributing trigger is usually a sense of intimidation portrayed by another human, a person "making fun" "running their mouths"....my heart rate goes up, and this rush of blue energy (in thought) seems to flow down my arms and legs like a river of adrenaline.  Its not long after that I begin to shake, every ounce of stressful thoughts fly through my mind, I don't yell or shout words back, I begin to foam at the mouth, even bleed out of my nose, my eyes glaze and I begin to scream in an animal like manner, I am aware inside but I can only see through my eyes the person I'm mad at, blurry mostly due to tears, uncontrollable crying and growling, no salivation control.  I smash things, feel no pain, break my hand and keep smashing things, I've thrown entire dressers out of windows, broken hinges and torn doors off houses.  After about 20 minutes on average rage I collapse and almost "wake up" thats when the person has fled in fear for their lives, and only the people who really know me pick me up, while others stand in aw.  I am so tired I have to sleep for 6 hours just to retain my energy.  I have no idea what this rage is, hypothalamic, bi polar rage, post traumatic.... I am at a loss.  Any ideas?
