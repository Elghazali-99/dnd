I just recently went back to work after being out of work for a year and the position I took is so demanding, that I feel like it's not at all what I was looking for. My last job was a get away from life job, I was a cashier at a grocery store and I had fun with the customers and I flirted and joked and I made comments to managers on how to improve things, but I was never asked to do anything more than what was expected of me, and that was just ringing thru the customers. I used to work 4 or 6 hour shifts with a 15 minute break avery 2 hours and a 1/2 hour lunch if i wourked a 6 hour shift. My new job, well for instance last night i was scheduled for 9 hours and i got a 1/2 hour break!! Not only do i cashier, but i dry mop the entire store, i vacuum, i mop, i put out the trash, i have to put all the returns back, stock the coolers, face all the shelves. sweep behind the counters, do the damages report, all this while I'm cashing out customers. I have 3 adult ADHD children at home who I have done a horrible job of raising because I do everything for them, so when I come home my house looks like a hurricane hit it! I have extreme fibromialgia, so as soon as I lay down the muscles in my legs tighten so severly I start to scream and cry. I haven't slept for days. And now my mental illness which is DID ( Dissassociative Identity Disorder) otherwise known as multiple personality, is getting worse again. I had a meetin with my therapist today and he was completely useless, cause I told him the things that relieved my stress work and cleaning are now casuing me pain, he just sat there. I started burning myself with a cigarette on my hand and then moved to my abdomen. I bunrt myself there over 30 times b4 this time was only 13, once i get started it's hard to stoop, it makes me feel free...I'm scared.
