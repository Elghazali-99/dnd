Well, here's my story.  My dad died unexpectedly a few years ago. I watched him die for 14 days.  It was very traumatic for me and my family.  After that, I had a long period of worrying about my own health and my families.  I quit smoking which added more issues in terms of anxiety and stress from withdrawal.  After that, every new ache, I thought I had a new serious problem.  After a year of that, I slowly got over those thoughts.  They were replaced however by muscle pains which I feel are from stress.  Work is very stressful for me, I have added strain from increased family responsibilities with my dad gone, etc.  I worry constanty which makes my upper back, shoulder, legs, knees etc., ache.  I just had a physical a month ago and the only issue I have is a below normal vitamin D level.  I have been taking Vitamin D 2000 iu daily for the last 3 weeks.  No change in my tension.  I am 6 foot, 195lbs and for the most part a fit person @ 35 years old.  The only times I have relief are intense exercise, sleeping or if my mind is totally distracted.  I now am even starting to hurt after sleeping and my sleep is interupted.  Please give me your opinion of what my next steps should be.  Thanks in advance.
