I've been living with my abusive boyfriend since october of 09. Things were great until we moved in together. He hits me for the slightest thing and talks to me like I'm his slave. I've been convincing myself that hell change, and I still think he will but the choice was recently taken from me. I've never told my family about the abuse because my dad would literally kill him. Recently my mom asked if he'd hit me, I told her no but my father showed up at my work today and told me that he and my uncle are moving me out of the apartment and they weren't having any arguments about it. 
 Being told to do this has given me a bittersweet realization. On one hand it feels good to release some of the stress from dealing with this alone and I feel much safer now that my dads involved but he's threatened to kill me on more than one occasion which is why I've been so afraid to leave him. 
 My situation is much better than most I imagine. My father is moving me into a new apartmentt, but my boyfriend knows where my dad lives where my mom lives my grandma, et cetera. I don't know what hell do when I'm not around my family like during work. Will I ever feel safe again?
