well, i never knew they had a discussion forum here related to abuse so thankful i found it... i myself have had my share of physical, verbal, sexual you name it, and sometimes still deal with the flasbacks but at a very young age of 5 sexuasl abuse started and went on until 9 years old , i some how found a way to numb it all out like i was not there i had and still have a safe place i go..do not know how but ever sincei was as young as 5 i have had my gift, i say gift because it truely is and was. even to this day things happen in marriages that only we know about, no one else really knows its embarrising and painful in many ways.. so i keep it behind the closed doors so to say.i have been told i love u and i promise to never harm u again..it always is worse the next time always worse. i dont know why or how i keep taking this after all iv been through but i doand i know he loves me.. i tell myself if only i diddnt say this or dfo that or supper was better ,its my fault or i numb out and forget it and go on with the day..stupid girl,huh? well, there are so many women and men , children also that live there lives this way just waiting on the promise to kick in i guess or believe its the only way.. they will tell you, that no one will have you n a ready made family! anything to break your spirit..anything they know all your weaknesses and use it against you.anyways im so glad i found this forum
