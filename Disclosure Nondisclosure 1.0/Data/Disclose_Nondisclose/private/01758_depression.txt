Here's the deal, there's this guy who's my friend that I met a few months ago in college. We've always gotten along well and hung out a lot. However, gradually he's seem to gotten more and more annoyed or bothered by me. The only time he talks to me is when I ask a question and his answer is always short and to the point. The only time he genuinely seems to like to be in my company is when we drink and he can laugh at me. I just feel like I immensely annoy him or something since he never seems to want to talk to me or just always seems so disinterested in what I have to say. I've confronted him about it but he told me to stop being a b***ch/woman. Am I blowing this out of proportion? I have no idea what to do anymore. I've considered him a best friend for a while but it seems he sees me as nothing more than a person he happens to know. I've been in a rampant state of depression for the last few weeks as it has only gotten worse, and I'm honestly worried for my health at this point. I just want him to be my friend and treat me like he does all his other friends. Sometimes I get dizzy and headaches from feeling so upset. It's come down to the point where I'm drinking a lot more often than I use to with friends not because I want to but just so I will feel better. I just want to feel happy again and feel like he's my friend. Am I overreacting? I just want to feel better again.
