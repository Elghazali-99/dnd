I'm becoming convinced I may have something wrong with me. I have been noticing ever since i broke into the world of teenage drama, relationships, and trying to find myself, that I tend to have these depressed times where I will be unhappy with everything and become annoyed at the slightest thing. It really on and off to. Like i could be sitting at my desk catching up on work and have a random thought and it will just send me down depression road. And as if I took something for it it can be gone just by a friend making me laugh. I mean of course its still there....just im not dwelling on it and i dont have the almost overpowering urge to go listen to music or use my own means to self medicate it. That might seem like a roller coaster all in its self. But then my anxiety hits and I dont want to be around people. I may still be with the friend that made me feel better and all of the sudden ill start thinking, "oh he/she is probably just acting friendly to get close to something I have or act like they know me". Its made me act bitter most of the time towards most people.
 Most of it started after losing the love of my life and still chasing after her (hopeless romantic its *****). But the anxiety has been there ever since early middle school. (11th grade now) and use to when I was younger and rarely now days i hear voices saying my name over and over.
 I don't know why im even writing all of this down here. I guess I want to see if anyone else thinks i should have this checked by an professional. My friends say i have a mood disorder and i dont doubt it but i hate to have anything to do with becoming like my father and he has depression and anger problems. Im starting to want actual help not just self medication.
