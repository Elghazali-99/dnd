I am not sure if I should put this under the depression topic or not..
I hate how I look.. I am about 5'7 and weigh around 190.. I am 16 going on to 17 in September..I hate my body and sometimes just want to take my fist and hit my stomach.. I have tried so many ways to lose weight but it dose not work.. Plus I get really stressed especially if its during a school year.. I used to get so stressed I would puke , sometimes this would go on for weeks.. And most of it has to do with how I see myself..
I see myself as fat ugly and worthless and sometimes I wish I would just die so I would not have to live my life dealing with my ugly self..
I used to cut and am struggling with it.. I cut from 6th grade to 10th..am now going on to 11th..
I would not say I have had a crappy life... My dad used to beat me and my mom was a alcoholic that used to take me out with her when she went to drink.. but things got better after a while..
I don't know what else to do..No matter how hard I try I am not happy with myself.. :cry: I am sick of feeling this way... I just want to be happy..
