My son is 17 and never leaves his room. One night I walked into his room and found that he had slashed his arms and had written on his walls. He slept in my bed until he was 13 and still sometimes comes in and I cuddle with him. He seemed to get very scared easily and paranoid so would run in my bed in the middle of the night. 
I thought he might have a form of retardation and sent him to a psychologist who tested his Iq at 132.But he still seems like a 4yo. He has rituals that he follows, and always becomes obsessed with certain things at different points of his life. I blame myself for spoiling him and not setting boundaries. I never fed him healthy foods and he grew up on junk.
His latest obsession is his father, who walked out on us years ago - my son has hated him ever since. He grew up to be just as antisocial as his father. 
I have asked lots of experts about my son. Some have diagnosed body dysmorphia, others social phobia, others ocd and one said he was a schizoid. He borders on all of these so does this make it BPD?
