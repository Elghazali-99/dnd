I have been on antidepressants for 15 to  20 years and I'm not really sure they do much good. I've never found a  counselor that I thought was someone I could talk to. I have four sons and I've been married for 33 years. One of my sons I seem to argue with over text messages a lot.  He has 2  kid's and it seems like the only time he ever text me is when he wants me to babysit. Don't get me wrong I love watching my grandkids. I would just like to be needed more than just as a babysitter.  I've come to the realization today that happiness for me comes through my kids And I guess they're not responsible for my happiness. I'm the only one that can make myself happy. I think I feel a lot of guilt for things that I've done in the past. I got married when I was 16 and by the time Ii was 23 I had four kids. My husband was 24 when we married. I love him dearly and I wouldn't change being married to him. We've both put each other through a lot of hell in the years that we've been married but we've overcome it. I don't have really any close friends. I don't have any activities outside of work except my grandkids and my kids. Life seems pretty lonely. I often get upset with my kids because I feel like they don't call me enough or they don't spend enough time with me. I really think I should just get off of this antidepressant medication and just get some counseling because I'm not getting anywhere. My biggest fear is that I will start having panic attacks again and I cannot take panic attacks. Panic attacks are disabling. I just don't know where to go from here. Just want some real happiness for myself and not from others.
