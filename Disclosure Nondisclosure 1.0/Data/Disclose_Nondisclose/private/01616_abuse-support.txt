I had a situation with my daughters now ex-boyfriend, who lived with us including there 19 month old son. My husband had come out from the bedroom to find the boyfriend masturbating in the living on the couch, watching porn on his cell phone. The problem with this is his 19 month old was playing three feet away from him. My husband was shocked but really not sure if what he saw was what he saw. My husband grabbed the baby and put a movie in the bedroom to keep the baby from being in the room with not being sure. Well, being a 19 month old and active, the baby tires of the movie and runs out into the living room. My husband right behind the baby rounds the corner to find the boyfriend again masturbating and watching porn. Then again grabs the baby being sure of what he saw this time and keeps the baby in the room. This happened again a third time. My husband not sure what to do informed me of the situation when I got home. I then informed my daughter of her boyfriends actions with his child in the room. 
Long story short, we kicked him out, made a report, and was slapped in the face to find the detective dropping the charges. The detective compared this to a mother or father taking a bath with there child. I know this isn't right. More ought to be done. Not even a indecent exposure ticket. Scott free, and come to find out he is trying to file for custody of my grandson. We are in the process of getting her full custody, and trying to have supervised visitation set up for him. I guess my question is they made us feel like we were over reacting. What should we do? And should we keep pursuing charges?
