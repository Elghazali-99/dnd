I have a young close relative, around 16 years old, boy, in high school, very smart, very handsome and healthy.
All is very good with him except that he is very very stressful when it comes to studing, it is not that he is not smart or does not have good grades, he has excellent grades and he is probably very smart, but he seat all day long and learn and it cause him a lot of pain and agony and he is really suffering.
 I will just give one example - he can spend hours and days trying to understand something very very deep in the content that no one really excpect him to know but he just can't go ahead unless he understand it, he does not want to go out of his room even for family because he is so stressful.
 We have no experience with that, it is only when it is related with studing, besdie that all is good but he makes the studing the whole world for him. It is very difficult to see him in this condition.
 I would appericiate any advice from your experience.
 Thank you,
Jack
