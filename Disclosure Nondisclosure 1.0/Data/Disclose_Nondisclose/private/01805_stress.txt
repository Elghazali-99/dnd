I dont know where to post this but I just need to get it out. I've had it. I'm 23 I've at home w/ my mom (single parent) & my 4 younger sisters. (6, 12, 15, & 18). My mom & I are close but then there's times where I cant stand her. It always seemed to me that its always about $, $ & more freaking $ talks. Its like thats always her concern. Doesnt ask how your day is, just starts off w/ her talks about problems. When  try telling her about my problems, she cuts me off. When me & my now 22 year old sister started going to college, she knew we were getting financial aid. She was always asking is for $$$$, all the time. We would give her $, & she still complained for more. (Dont get me wrong, I love my mom...I know shes been through a lot.) She complained about oh I'm wasting my gas, my time etc. We were 18 & 19 at that time. Trying to save up for a used car. That never happened. I know its hard on my mom. She does a lot for us. She takes care of my sister (18) who has learning disabilities, she looks completely normal btw. She gets SSI checks for her. She also gets welfare & other help to help her w/ my sisters who's dad left w/ another lady to have another family & does not provide child support. Another sister of mine 25, just moved back home after having a few troubles with her partner. (She also has mental problems & looks normal). Also SSI checks for her. 
 I tried going to school & working. But I couldnt do it. I couldnt work full time to get enough money to have enough to pay monthly things & give my mom $. I couldnt take more than 2 class a week. So at the moment, Im hoping I have better luck next yr to enroll. I really want to go to school. Just recently I bought my 1st car w/ my tax return $. I have asthma, which I havent had serious attacks lately til recently. I dont have health insurance so I try my best to take care of myself good. Recently I became injured at work. Injuring my knee. I havent work since 2 months ago. I am not receiving much from workers comp. Not enough to help me pay my needs & still assist my mom. It turns out I need surgery. So here I am waiting for surgery to get back to work ASAP. My mom keeps nagging at me to just get PT & go back to work. But PT will not help, I have a large tear from injury. Her complaining & b****ing all the time is causing me to get asthma attacks or get agitated & have trouble breathing. I start yelling w/ her & that doesnt help me or her. I know she can also get sick. I dont know what to do. For the past mb 2 weeks, all I have been doing is crying non stop. Im stressing out, I dont know what to do. Im selling so many of my things online. I've had it w/ our every single day arguments that I want to move out, I need to move out. But I cant do it right now. The more Im here w/ her, the more I feel like I am getting more depress, more messed up. & I feel like Im just going to end up hating her, which I dont want to do. I feel like me being at home, I am able to help my sisters. Assist my mom w/ a bit of $ for a few things she might need. Helping w/ school things, uniforms etc. There's times where she tells me to get out bc I am not paying her much. Its too much to bare with........
