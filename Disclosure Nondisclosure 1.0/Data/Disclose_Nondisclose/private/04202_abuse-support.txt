ok this will sound so strange but when i was little my father sexually abused me off and on until i was about six maybe i never knew if he was ever awake when he did this because we had to share a bed and a room and he always looked like he was asleep his eyes were never opened or anything. it stopped after that because i started laying in my own room at night and i never knew it was wrong until my grandmother told me about kids that have been through that. i never told her or anyone because i didn't want my dad to go to jail or for him to think i hated him. and what was so wierd is that whenever him and my grandmother would talk to me about sexual abuse and how you should always tell somone he never looked as though he had any knowlegde of what happened. i am a teenager now and i have told friends about it and they always say he doesn't seem like that kind of guy. my grandmother has passed away and i am now with my dad, boyfriend, and grandfather and me and my dad get along great. he is very easy to talk to he is always there when i have a problem. i just don't know if he knows what he did or if my childish mind made something up. i am very scared because i recently got anxiety and people say that sexually abused children grow up to have mental disorders am i going to be like that even though i really have no hatred or fear towards my father for something that happened almost ten years ago. i mean i grew up fine and happy but i just got anxiety but i highly doubt it's from that
