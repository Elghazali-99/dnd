Dear Doctor:
I have been taking medications from 2003.i was very stressed up in office at work and i was taking cough syrup which i was addicted to(it contained codeine phosphate) for 2 years .then 1 day at work i started hearing noises like people calling me names.it started getting worse and worse.then i met a psychiatrist who recommended that i take 20 mg of Tab Arpizolam,i just recently discontinued taking that medication since it has many side effects and shifted to daily 100 mg Tab levazeo and 0.25 mg tab etilaam morning and night,i am feeling better but if i forget to take the medications say once in the morning i immediately feel an undescribable feeling inside my head.it becomes hot and like my screw is getting looser.i dont know what to do and how to start a normal life without these medications.i am planning to start a business soon and that will keep me busy throughout the day.but can i do it is the question?i want to decrease and finally stop these tablets.please give me some suggestions...thankyou so much.
