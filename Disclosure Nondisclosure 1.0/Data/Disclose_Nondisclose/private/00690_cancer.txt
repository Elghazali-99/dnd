Hello Doc Fernando! Just want to ask about the my results in Xray and Sputum. 
(1) In my Chest PA xray remarks says that "Suspicious densities are seen in the left upper lung field. Spot view  with winged out scapula is suggested." 
 (2) then last May 3, 2011. I undergo again for Spot view and the results says: "Ancillary study shows nodulohazy in the left upper lobe, likely tuberculous in etiology."
 (3)  But my sputum test results are: 
    (a) Culture and sensitivity - Results: NORMAL RESPIRATORY FLORA; 
   
   (b) AFB Staining (1st to 3rd Collection) -Results: Negative for Acid fast Bacilli; 
    (c) KOH Smear - Results: Negative for Fungal Elements
    (d) Gram Staining - Result: WBC = 3-4/HPF
                                E. Cells = 0-2/HPF
                                Gram Positive COCCI in PAIRS = 0-2/OIF
  My question is this. Do I have a PTB, KOCH Disease or TB? Im bothered about my chest Xray (SPOT VIEW) and my gram staining results. I was then cured for Pneumonia way back  2004. Is it the scar they see on my xray?
