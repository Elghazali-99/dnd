My focus is on treatment and what I need that could help me and I am currently experiencing anhedonia that is there all the time everyday despite the fact that the depression itself is gone.  
 Now I realize that scientific theories regarding depression and anhedonia are just theories--they are not facts.  But I am willing to try supplements and such according to scientific theories to see if they help or not.
 One of these theories regarding anhedonia is right here:

 Since melanocortins might be the problem here, could you give me the name of the supplements and such that I need to take that will address this issue with the melanocortins (like something that will block the MC4 receptor or anything else I need to take that will somehow address this issue with the melanocortins in a different way)?
