I'm turning 15 in a few weeks and the past few months I've been remembering bits from when I was 7 to about 11. I had a friend and I'd go to her house she was the same age as me and she would touch my vagina. I remember telling her to stop that I didn't want her to do it. She threatened me saying that if I told anyone that she would do it to my other best friend. I didn't tell anyone about it at all, I don't know if it happened to my other friend too. The girl that was hurting me moved away but the other friend who it could have happened to goes to my current school. I don't know what to do. I've been considering telling my form teacher about it but I don't even know how to start a conversation like that. Was it even abuse? I feel like I let her do it. If I reported it to the police could they do anything since it was so long ago and I have no evidence. The other friend isn't even my friend anymore because we just drifted apart so I don't know what to do with regards to her. Should I tell a teacher about all of it and see if they could speak to her? Should I write an anonymous note and put it in her locker saying that she is not alone and that it happened to me I case it did happen to her?
