Year 10 has started for me and there are so much new students. My bestfriend's other bestfriend moved into my skl and she'd like it for us to be tripple best friends. She then got another best friend so now they're very close within one day. In year 8 and 9 (She just moved in since year 8) We are the closest inseperatable friends. She follows me everywhere and I loved that. We blabber all day and we even call each other after skl. She's very cute and immature. Today she got new friends and completely forgot about me. She used to share every videos with me, now she hides them from me and shows her friends, not as if she hates me, she's just playing but she's not as loyal as usual. On lunch i escaped my ither group of friends to go hang out with her and the new friends which im greatful to meet, but she asks innocently why im following her (She doesnt mean it of course) but that breaks my heart amd almost made me cry rigt there. I have to admit im kind of jealous of those two now. She doesnt give me any dirty looks or anything but she forgot about me. I seem to be boring for her except in some classes when theres only me and her. How am i to be nice to her friends who are new students when she shows them most attention and they own each other and forgot me. Her friends probably have no idea how close we were. Heck we fought to death once and still reunite and laugh at it together. We took care of each other even when in pain. I spared her my water. She spared me her drink. How can make her see me the same again?
