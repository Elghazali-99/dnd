When i was 14 years old my mother went away to finish her masters degree but i was living with my grandmother. Shes kinda feeble. I am an only child so at that stage i was in the 9th grade. I never had any one to guide me and tell me whats right. I started to secretly date this 16 year old guy that was in the 11th grade. he asked me for sex but i said no because i was afraid and at the time i was still a virgin. However he forced me into doing it. I went home afterwards and cried because i felt like a ****. My vagina was burning me when i went home and it looked kinda red. About a year after i looked at my vagina one day and realized it looked weird because some little bumps were growing in clusters on the labia (lips of your vagina). I showed my mother and she took me to the doctor. I lied to her that i had never had sex before because i didnt want her to hurt me. Anyways the doctor took a look at it and told me i had HPV (gential warts) i cried so badly and my mother found out i was not a virgin. I felt depressed that i contracted that STD and i wish i could go bk and change the past because now i am so ashamed and have suffered from depression ever since. I am planning on removing the warts in easter of 2016 because i am now 19 years old. I told my present bf about what happened and he has stayed with me and comforted me and we have been dating for 3 years now. I worry about myself so much and my chances of cervical cancer smh i am crying typing this message because my life is messed up. I have contracted a yeast infection since week due to an antibiotic i was taking and the itch and burn is terrible. I got monistat for it tho but i am ashamed and afraid to go to a gynecologist. Iwant to be able to have children but am afraid because i dont want them to contract my warts. My life is so messed up smh am so ashamed and depressed ever since. Would someone give me some guidance and help please?
