Hi
I dont really know what this comes under i am really confused about it and i dont like asking people who personally knows me because it concerns me that they may think im just weird. I feel like i have a personality inside of me which is another person? Its still me but a completly different me. I literally have conversations with myself as if im talking to someone else. I will argue with this 'human personality', have full blown conversations asking and replying etc. I (the main me) will defend myself against this other me in my head and will then go on to reply as this other person in response. I have had this since i was really young. When i have self harmed in the past this other personality person thing in my head will be telling me how stupid i am (well im saying it but its not the main me it is like someone else kind of) and will tell me to stop and stop and i (the main me) will be shouting back saying they dont understand etc and so on so forth cant write down all the examples its been going on for years and will end up here forever.  It's really really confusing i dunno if this is normal and most people do it or is there some other reason. Any answers will be greatly appreciated. Just want some ideas and help really.
