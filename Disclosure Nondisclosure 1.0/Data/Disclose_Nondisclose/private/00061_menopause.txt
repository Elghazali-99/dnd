Hi, i am a 38 yr old female and over the last 18 months have been experiencing pelvic type pain which comes and goes without warning. This pain feels quite colicky when it occurs and can last from a few minutes or up to an hour. The pain can be very intense and on the pain score i would rate it as an 8 out of 10. When it occurs i feel like i need to pass urine  but when i go to the toilet there is hardly any flow of urine. Over the last 6 months i have also been experiencing pain to the right side of my back near the area of my kidneys which also can be disabling, but this also comes and goes without warning. Both the pelvic and back pain normally dont coincide with one another.However i normally feel like i want to pass urine and that my bladder is full.. 
six years ago i had abnormal smear tests which showed mild dyskariosis. I was treated for this over 4 years as my smear tests kept coming back abnormal. For the last 2 years they have come back clear. However i also get bleeding in between my periods which feel like an actual period. For instance i came off a period 5 days ago and have restarted bleeding again.. My periods are also quite disabling and i feel fatigued all the time and moody .
 I also experience a lot of palpitations on rest.
My mother had a full hysterectomy and removal of her ovaries when she was in her late 20's for ovarian cancer. Im not sure whether i could be premenopausal or whether i need to be concerned about something else? I have been to m G.P in relation to the back pain on which she thought was musculoskeletal..
