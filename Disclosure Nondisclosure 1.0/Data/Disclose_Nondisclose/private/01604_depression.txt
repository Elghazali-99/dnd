I really need help. I don't know what's happening to me, mentally, physically and just everything.I've been going through traumatic stress lately, to where even dropping my favorite coffee mug made me get constant suicidal thoughts that pushed me to the edge of my 2nd story bedroom window.Whenever my brother breaths, sniffles, or smacks it makes me want to rip myself out of my own skin.My mother often calls me crazy and mental whenever I get angry over the sight of my brother breathing, or any other person breathing in general.What I often do to avoid these sounds is locking myself in my own room, causing me to miss weeks and weeks of school to where the school threatened to take me to court about my absences.That happened about a year ago, their still threatening to do it.. And it only made things worse.After passing out after I walked out of guidance after hearing that, it was only then I started hearing voices and hallucinating things, scary things.I've been living with these strange pitched voices and horror like hallucinations for only half a year so it still makes me scared.Whenever I get mad now, I pass out and start foaming this weird white stuff. After I wake up from losing conciousness I get major migraines.This is all because of my annoyance of sounds that I try to block out with my AC, and because of my brother purposely getting me in trouble by my mother who screams at me about seven times every day.I decided it's best to kill myself.It's not like I don't have any friends, I do. But I never get to see them..I tried getting help once but all the people said I was selfish and would make other people sad by my suicide and selfish acts which only makes me want to kill myself more.I'm starting to get violent too, and it's scaring me. I often wake up with large scratches and my back covered in blood by these scratches and I think that's a sign to hurry the **** up and jump off a cliff.So i DONT want to die, I'd much rather be happy and live a happy life without my brain killing me inside, but I think it will make everyone happier other than my friends if I died instead, since I will give my mom a break from stress and my brother not constantly being watched by me so I can make sure he's not mouth breathing since I'm selfish like that Im Scared of myself and death so I'm going to die.
