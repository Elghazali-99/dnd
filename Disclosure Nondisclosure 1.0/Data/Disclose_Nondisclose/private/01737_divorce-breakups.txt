My ex and I been together for 1 yr and 5months. He's 26 and I'm 24 we're engaged. He moved to Canada 9months ago and I was left here in Philippines and supposedly our wedding is on April 2015. But one day we had a very common fight and didnt expect he overly reacted and called our wedding off.. he just told me he's not yet ready and i cant accept his reason! Then he made a new fb acct he told me that he added some girls from his past but assured me he didnt had any flirt chats with them he just told them that the wedding is off! Then he txted me asking for another chance and i told him we will be ok if you'll going to give me an access to ur new fb bacause i suspected something and ye didnt gave me access and told me he dont want a fight if i saw ar read somthing! He will be home this decemeb and he just call an emergency leave to go home to talk to me but still he cant drop his fb acct or give me his fb acct info..he kept on choosing that stupid fb over me for 3 times! 
What should i do?? Do i need to still meet him when he get back or move on with my life???
