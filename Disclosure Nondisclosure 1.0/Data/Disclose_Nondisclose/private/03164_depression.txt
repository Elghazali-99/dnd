Okay, so I am having an issue.  I was extremely suicidal and depressed and had mood swings all over the place and extreme apathy about everything.  Like I wasn't living.  I diagnosed myself with a dopamine deficiency.  I told the doctor I wanted Wellbutrin.  He gave me 450mg to begin (which I knew was high).
 The strange thing is...I took the Wellbutrin the first day and about 30minutes later, I knew I was under the influence of something.  I wasn't as depressed, my negative thoughts were mostly gone, but everything was really hazy.  It is like I am living in a dream world.  Like, you KNOW you are doped up on this drug...at least with me.  I was surprised at the quick effects..
 Anyway...on to my concerns.  A part from the haze I am under, I cannot sleep.  If I go to sleep I wake up in the middle of the night (never had this problem).  I actually used to sleep like 15 hrs/day.  Now I am lucky to sleep 4 hours.  And I am never really tired, I always feel awake on it.  Also, I used to love food.  Like food was the high light of my life.  But with wellbutrin, food is nothing.  It isn't pleasurable.  I cannot even eat all my food usually because I just don't want to.  
 Also I am severely agitated and irritated by everything.  I think wellbutrin transferred my once overpowering depression into overpowering hate and hostility.
 Basically wellbutrin really makes me feel drugged up all of the time.  
 I should probably tell the doctor to lower the dose to like 150mg...Any suggestions?  I like the drug because it helps with my apathy and severe depression and suicidal tendencies.  But it seems to be transferring this negative energy in other ways (though I prefer these side effects over how I used to feel...)
