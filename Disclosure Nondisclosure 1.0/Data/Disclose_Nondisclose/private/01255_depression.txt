I am really terrified. I am an RN; 57 years old and have been a nurse for 32 years. It's all I know. I am divorced and I have a lot of debts. 
 Recently I have found myself not only hating nursing, but unable to perform my job adequately. I am overwhelmed by the enormous amount of work and I really don't think I can do it. Recently our staffing grid changed AGAIN and we now have 20% more work than we did when I got hired for this job 6 months ago. IT was tough then but it is impossible now.
 Job stress caused me to be hospitalized for depression 2 years ago; at that time I swore I'd never work in a hospital again. Financial realities have dictated that go back into patient care, but trying to do this job is once again causing me to feel like I am losing my faculties. My brain feels like swiss cheese;  I do have ADD and there is no medicine that is helping me right now. 
 If I quit this job I will lose everything I have, everything I worked for all these years but if I keep it I will surely go totally crazy. Is there any help out there for me?
