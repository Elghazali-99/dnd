I have 82 days until my EDD and I don't want to be pregnant anymore. I don't feel connected. I didn't even realized I had 82 days until I just looked, I thought I had more. This isn't my first pregnancy. I was clinically depressed before I became pregnant. I used to cry and pray everyday on my way to and from work I wouldn't make it. I didn't want my life to go on but I couldn't see any light. My superiors at work verbally and emotionally beat me up and made it aware they didn't want me there. Somehow in this chaos I developed social anxiety disorder. I don't feel
Comfortable around anyone and I only leave my home twice a week. Once to see my therapist and once for custody exchange. Once every three weeks I leave three times a week for my ob visit. I make it out about once a month to get groceries but I usually have to leave abruptly because of the anxiety. Sometimes I have to sit in the parking lot and wait the entire time. I'm not ready for this baby her father isn't helping although he says he will but he has said that since day one. I was terminated from my job today because my leave was more than 90 days. My mom is now paying my bills. I'm not on state assistance. 
I just want to go for a walk or a drive and not come back. I don't want to breathe anymore. I hurts to breathe. I hurts so bad inside. Idk what to do. My mom doesn't understand she says just go get another job. My SO says he will take care of everything. He doesn't and hasn't.
