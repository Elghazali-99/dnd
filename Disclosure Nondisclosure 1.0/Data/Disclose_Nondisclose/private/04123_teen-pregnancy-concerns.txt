On the 10th of July, I had dry sex and my partner came on me and it dripped down the sides of my vagina and near my hole. I quickly sprang up and went to the bathroom to wipe it off. I'm still a virgin so my partner told me that even though the *** was near my hole, i probably wouldn't get pregnant and he's trying to reassure me that that sperm would have needed to ejaculated inside my vagina so that it would be close enough to swim to an egg for me to get pregnant. I was panicking the next 24 hours when my best friend told me to take a plan B pill. She said that it would lessen my chances of getting pregnant but that it doesn't 100% guarantee I wouldnt get pregnant so to just hope and pray to get my period in the next 10 days since my last period was on the 20th of last month. From what I've been reading on other health posts, the pill was totally unnecessary to take and I am definitely not pregnant. Is this true? Should I worry? I've also read that because I took the pill even though I didn't have to, my next few periods should be off. If I don't have my period 7 days after my normal period day should I take a pregnancy test? PLEASE HELP!
