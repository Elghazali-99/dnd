I am a mum of three children.  My oldest child, my son is 17.  I am struggling every day with him.  He is seeing a psychologist at the moment who has diagnosed him as having depression.  My problem is he sleeps all day and is awake all night, and every single night he kicks off without fail.    He is a big tall lad, and is very threatening in his manner.  He is so demanding of attention it is unreal... to the point where he sat in front of me the other day and said 'take notice of me'.  Tonight I asked him to go upstairs so I could have some space because he was winding his younger brother up (he is 10) and getting aggressive.  He refused point blank.  Just kept saying 'Why should I'.  His manner is so threatening.  I dread every single night.  The only peace we have now in the house is through the day when he is asleep.  I have told him I am going to tell the psychologist about his behaviour and he ended up screaming 'You Crazy Psycho *****' at me.  My other two children are in bed and he is stomping around the house screaming at me.  I can't cope.  I have had a social worker here to assess whether my other children (my son who is 10 and my daughter who is 13) are safe because my daughter told a teacher at school what my oldest son was like and the teacher reported it to Children's services.  I am honestly starting to hate my son and I am so ashamed about it.
Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions on what I can do.. I am completely and utterly lost.
Thank you.
