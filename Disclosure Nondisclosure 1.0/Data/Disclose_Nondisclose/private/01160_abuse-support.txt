Hi, i got married few months back. After 2 months i got to know that my husband had married few years back and marriage was cancelled to to mistrust on that woman. From the very first day , my in-laws and my husband start instructing me what to do and what not to do? they told me not to call my parents as well. they take advantage of me for every house chore. they claim i should respect his parents and him and no matter whatever they say i should not reply back and just do it whether it is correct and in-correct. very easily i am being blamed for anything which goes wrong. and they asked to massage his mum everyday and one day when i didn't do it they made hell out of it and scolded me for not doing it and said i dis-respect them. I am not allowed to go, eat, shop by myself.  Everyday they ask me to watch religious programme and ask what did i learn from it? and how does it applies  to me ? everytime they give me an example how do i behave at work when my boss say something. In the same way i should behave at home as they are master and boss for me. There is a lot of mental pressure for every activity. Now, they don't even let me visit my father as well. I have been an independent woman and lived alone by myself for last 10 years in many countries. Still, according to my husband and family, i am a lousy person. To me it is a clear abuse. i have discussed many time these things with my husband and said that i feel bad about it. but he has no concern for me and says that i should open up my mind. and says that if i don't agree with whatever they say then my kids in the future will behave in the same way. To me , this marriage which is only 7 months old, is about ownership and they want  me to isolate from my family and take control on me with their power.  Pls suggest how should i handle the situation? what shall i do?
