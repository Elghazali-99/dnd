I've had the implanon in for a year now, and it's making me insane! I had an abortion last year and got the implant put in afterward.. I'm unsure if it's because I didn't allow myself to think about it or if it's the implant making me feel this way.
 I've been having really strange thoughts, i'm paranoid of thinking things like 'kill (someone close to u)', I'm only thinking this because i'm trying so had not to think of it if that makes sense? anyway i wouldn't even kill a spider I just feel like I have no control over my thoughts? I've also developed psoriasis, scalp psoriasis which is making my hair fall out and I've had countless episodes of tonsilltis since then, this is also making me more stressed.
 I've been such a **** to my boyfriend for no reason, I just get angry or majorly emotional for no reason at all, have no sex drive and constant feeling tired. this has only been happening since I got my implant, before then I was bubbly and happy and wasn't depressed about a thing.
 I've seen loads of other girls on here describing similar effects to me, it's really great to know I'm not alone in this crazy anxiety implant world! Please reply with your stories, it really helped me reading other posts on here!
