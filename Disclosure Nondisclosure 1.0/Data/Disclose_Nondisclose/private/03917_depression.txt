Has anyone here (I'm sure) received ECT treatments? I did two-three treatments a week from October 2014 - December 2014. My depression is basically gone, even though I haven't done a treatment since the second week of Dec, it's like a miracle. However, I'm not sure if the trade-off is worth it. I can't concentrate on anything anymore, especially tv, reading and conversations. I feel like I've had a minor lobotomy almost for lack of a better way to describe it. So many of my memories long ago and recent are gone, which I knew going in toot would happen. But not being able to remember someone's name right after they told me isn't something I was prepared for. I can't think anymore also, even doing simple math, which I think is a side effect from not being able to concentrate. I always feel cloudy which I know is partly due to my severe anxiety it I know it isn't all from that. I'm only taking 150 mg of Wellbutrin and 200 mg of Trazodone (which is nothing for me, I use to take 650 mg of seroquel and 300 mg of Trazodone at bedtime) Has anyone experienced this or something similar?
