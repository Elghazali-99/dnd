My sister and her husband have  physical fights which involve lost of screaming yelling throwing things. They have one child a six year old named McKenzie there is also lots of drug usage between the parents. I try to tell my sister she needs to get out of her marriage for the sake of her daughter this has affected her daughter, who thinks she has to stay home when her parents fight so her mom doesnt get hurt. I dont want to call cps because i dont want my sister to lose her daughter like i lost my children any ideas on a different approach to take. I already take my niece as much as possible right now dad is in jail for domestic violence and breaking a order of protection but like always my sister will take him back!!! I have thought about sending my niece to Idaho to be with family my sister agrees but will not sign the paper to put her in school cause she will lose her check is there a way around her signing any info will be helpful im trying to brainstorm for the sake of my nieces emotional health as well as physical well being .
