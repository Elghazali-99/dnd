I'll start by introducing myself. Im 13 and I have only a close group of good friends that I can trust, im shy and quiet most of the time but I can be out going sometimes. So lately I've been really out of it. I've been sad all the time and just not myself. I haven't cut myself but it's gotten really close to it, I've held a knife at my skin and almost broke it but I've stopped myself. My mom told me before if I cut myself that she would beat me half to death. I've thought about suiside but I'm to scared. I told my cousin that I thought I was depressed but she said "that happens to everyone, your fine." I tried to tell my sister but she said it's just my hormones. My two closest friends approached me together and told me that I've been different lately and asked me what's wrong do I told them. They have been kinda supportive but then after a while they said that I was just wanting attention. I think I'm depressed because my dad left me when I was 8 and well its a long story  and I recently found out that my mom does drugs. I found this out by looking in the crack in her door because I thought she was sleeping and I accidentally cut myself on my leg when I was shaving. Then after that everything just fit together. I don't know what to do. My mom isn't really the supportive type and my grandparents always think I'm bluffing and will knock me down as soon as I tell them. The rest of my family kinda hates me. What do I do? I feel like the world could just collapse at any time. Im sorry if this is long but please help.
