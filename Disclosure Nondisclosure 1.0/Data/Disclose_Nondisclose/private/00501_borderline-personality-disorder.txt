it's being pretty tough on my side after marriage. First want to give a little back ground of me and situation. I work in a Mental Health field which deal with Inpatient Lock-up legal holds in CA we call "Patients' Right Advocate" for 4 coming 5 years.  So i do see all kind types of psy. patients, you name i saw it". So i have pretty good experiences and knowledge about MH. A lot of time i do come across clients with BPD, and i do discuss and gain knowledge direct from psychiaritists (listen to different opinions), 80% of Psy. Dr. have the same conclusion is BPD is really hard to due with esp. their beloved one. 
Anyway back to my life i got marry this early this year....after dating almost 9years.  But things dont get worst after marriage. I have so many unknown, unpredicted, came out of nowhere for examples: here only few that i can remember (l blessed that im the type his bad memories to bad things)..
*my wife will get SUPER up-set by me not making her sandwich for her to go to work (we both agree there is no ingredients and will go to Costco pick up the next day). She will say I should of run off with another man. instead of marry you! (I was PO, im not those explode type but silent type and i sure a lot of man will get PO over your spouse say stuff like that)
*Tell everyone how i treated her bad,hate her, disrespect her. 
*Doing laundry she will do her laundry only(she do her laundry well i wasnt home), when i want to do my laundry and ask her with respect, she will say my laundry waste waters and a lot. and kind of give u a sense that do ur laundry 3 week later, which that how long she and her brother do laundries.
*She will so disrespect you in front of people esp at her side of her family, Say a lot of thing to put you down and make you look like a 2nd class citizen well with her family. constantly teaching her niece to call me "Uncle Fat Pig" I'm 5'11" weight 180lbs. 
*She seem to like to start drama at works and home. ex: a male coworker and a female coworker is having an affair (both marry), my wife will go to the male coworker's wife to go to their work place to start things up. so everyone can see their problems so it can make shame to those two having affair.
*Unable to keep her mouth shut, when i tend to talk to her something should be private. before me and her. She will go around the her side of the family members say about my stuffs that i told her, reach suppose to between both of us. and she dont sense its a problem about privacy. 
*always focus on the outside appearances, how she looks, and the body sharp, never skinny enough.  5'5" 102lbs and she wanted to be 98lbs. like those model in the magazine and she is in her mid 30s.   
*Always want to stay home to do nothings, extreme less social group, hardly can keep old friends (people like to call her about their problem, but she will feel annoying by them...always told me hate them to call)
*Bitter about everything, her life is no good, no money(not a lot money but money), why me as a husband need her to work (we live in high cost of living city). constantly compare me with others, why u cant be like who and who...
 the list can be on and on and on...and weekly we have big fight over something really minor or sometime she will get extreme upset that i have no idea why?
At this moment she havent direct talk to me for 1.5 day and seriously no clue why (im those type like to recap and recall my memory all the time bc i have a bad one LOL)so i constantly think "what just happen!?"
but my wild guess is on thursday we to a sunglass store bc i want to buy a new sunglass and the way i saw it is she kind of ask a lot of hardship questions and with different opinions with the Sales person. they both got a little tension there, but i know my wife is the one who started. and she got upset over the sales person and saying he is an *******, rude and a lot of trash boy from the sales but of course was there and listen to the whole conversation and i know wife is the person started. but at that moment i didnt say anything bc i dont want to step in but i did do is i will come back couple day later to choose again(i being buying sunglass form the sales/owner for 3 years i go back each year and my wife also my sunglasses from him to last year summer, so they know each other already). since than her mood changes, by Friday I pick her up at train station it around 6pm Friday it got little traffic from where i coming from. i was late little bit less than 5mins the moment she hoop on the saw she start saying i was suffer my outside by waiting for you? I told her i have bad traffics today and she can see the traffic from where she is standing. I told her i was only late for 5mins when you call me after u got off the train, just a little wait....she got super upset. than through out the night til she turn on the radio at 1am (she never listen to radio at night) she want to listen radio and 3am turn on the main light. and when she get in bad she sleep on the other end of bed. until now Sat (i have whole day church meeting from 930am-800pm...she haven't direct talk to me since mid of Thurs)
 Seriously i dont know how to handle any farther, if she keep doing this over and over. It stress for me. I have an intense job and by the time i got home i have another battlefield going on. it stressful!! We did saw our head pastor and her wife both are licensed marriage counselors.  They realize our problems, they said its common in early marriage life but i told them "yes some of them just bc we have different life style with new adjustments, but a lot of the is personality issues or disorder but they dont understand enough, what i have going through at home (some of is my fault bc i have bad memory recap in those bad situations). 
 The only thing i can do is Totally rely on God and pray to him my matters...but my day to day battle with my wife is tough, sometime i do lost faith over it.  All i can do is hold on to His Words....and Faith.
