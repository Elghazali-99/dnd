I am BluCrystal, or Blu for short.  I am a 43 year old woman, married to a wonderful man for 17 years, and mother of four great kids who are all out of the nest now.  I work in the local variety store about 30 hours a week, and my husband is self employed.  We live in a little house made of river rock over 50 years ago, and our yard is very park-like when it gets mowed! :-)  I was chosen to be your new leader for alot of reasons, some of which I will tell you now:  (all of this happened before I met my current husband)  I was verbally, emotionally, and physically abused by an alcoholic for two years, and there was sexual abuse and rape in my teen years.  You will learn more of this as time goes on.  I may no longer live in your hell, but I have been in it.  I know that pain and fear as well as I know the back of my hand.  I know when to listen, when to stay silent, when to speak up.  I AM HERE FOR YOU, EVERY ONE, TO HELP YOU ANY WAY I CAN.  You may send me a private message anytime, and I will respond within a day.  And due to a computer glitch, I am unable to post anything in any thread unless it is to begin one or to answer one from the 'new questions list' (anyone with pc knowledge please msg me!).  That being said, most of my communications with you will be by pvt message.  Here is a hug for all of you: ((((NO MORE ABUSE)))  Blessings - Blu
