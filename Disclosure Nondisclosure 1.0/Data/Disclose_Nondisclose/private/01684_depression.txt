I cant seem to do anything right.  my niece works nights and sleeps all day I have to be quiet she gets upset. so I started sleeping  in the day.  I don't like it.  my body is so mixed up.  the kids have been here since since Friday and she trying to sleep all day you cant keep a 11 month old and a 7 year old and a 73 year old quiet.  she kept hollering at everyone.  we had our get together on Christmas and she would not get out of bed and come eat or open presents with us or even come out an say hi to her daughter.  think they were really upset at her she had slept alight and day and then all night again.  don't know how she can sleep so much.  when I happen to see her she gripes about everything.  I know the same old story.  I really cant take much more. I made a doctors appointment when she told me and then got mad I set it for that time.  it sleeted all night and for 3 days.  the doctors office was closed I have to go in on jan 7 that is his earliest appointment. I am so lonely I get sick and I am alone.  sorry I guess I am feeling sorry for myself again. we did have fun on Christmas eve anyway.  mandy876
