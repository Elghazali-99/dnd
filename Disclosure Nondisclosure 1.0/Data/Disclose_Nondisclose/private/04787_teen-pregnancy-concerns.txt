Hey again I have a few additional questions to my problem that I posted before (2-3 days ago maybe?). Well, those of who haven't read my concern it's about me missing my period and I am now 2-3 weeks late. I have never had sex with anyone before but I have gotten more and more worried as the time went by. I know if you haven't had sex or had a penis even close to your vagina you shouldn't be pregnant but I am still in quite a hassle. I've had lower mild cramps but not bad enough to be my normal period cramps. I'm wondering if that's normal if you missed your period? I have not had any spotting, morning sickness, headaches or back pains but I have had a decrease in sleep which is probably causing me to be much more sleepier. I do a sport every Tuesday and don't get back til about 10 at night. One day, though I was very dizzy for a little part of the day, I couldn't even look up but is that just a sign that I was tired? That was a day after my practice. I really hope I am not pregnant...Even though the odds are very low. Please help! thanks
