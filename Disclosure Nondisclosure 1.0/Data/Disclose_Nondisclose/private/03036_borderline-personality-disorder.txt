I have seen three counselors,and psychologist. All three say something different, the last dr, borderline personalitiy disorder. The second Dr, mild bi-polar. The first said depression.
 I must say most days are normal for me, I lead a normal happy life. No alcohol, no drugs or tobacco. I have a wonderful family. All seems great on the outside. On the inside for some reason I feel alone and pain stricken with heart ache, I try to keep my mind off myself, I pray. I dont understand these feelings of hoplessness and tiredness, only with triggers, like someone hurting my feelings or my family some how. I feel so much heartache I have considiered sucidide, however, I want to live on the days that I do not have my triggers. Rude poeple are my triggers. My husband yelling at me and being in a bad mood is a trigger. I also am triggered by bad weather. I would never hurt anyone else only myself. Sometimes I want to make myself bleed adn cut my arm just because in my mind i feel if i let the blood out that would hurt and not my heart. What is up with me?. there is no  solid diagnosis. I want to live. What are tools to take away these thoughts of mine?
