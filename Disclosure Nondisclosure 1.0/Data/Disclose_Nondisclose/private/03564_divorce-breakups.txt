My wife and I recently got divorced. Her parents and daughter treated her so badly for so long because she was married to me that it made me feel sorry for her and that eventually made me decide that she'd be better off if she wasn't with me anymore. I filed for divorce and we both signed the papers and we continued to see each other for about a month n a half and then we kind of just quit talking all together. I still love her and didn't want to do any of that. I've been in at least 30 relationships and I've never been even remotely close to being as happy as I have been the last 4 years with her. I want my wife back and I don't know what to do anymore. As much as I didn't want to file for divorce I'd rather her b happy with somebody else than as beat down all the time by her family like she was when we were  together. My family didn't think we should b together either but none of them treated me any different than before and were all nice to her. I don't know what to do I've never felt this sad or cried this much before. I miss her every second I'm awake. I did what I thought was best for her even tho it's killing me now. Please help
