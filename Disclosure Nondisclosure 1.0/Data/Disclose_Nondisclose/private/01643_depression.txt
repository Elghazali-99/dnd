I am a full time student, I work and I take care of my grandmother. Since we had no college because of the snow, professors have pilled up on assignments. I'm so overwhelmed…and to make matters worse, my grandma keeps telling me to do stuff for her. I've done so much work for her already, I have no time for myself or even to keep up with my school work. I feel like I'm about to have breakdown that's how tired and nervous, depressed I am. I can't stop shaking, I just need a break from EVERYTHING. 
 My grandma thinks I have it extremely easy, that I'm being lazy. But I'm not! It's extremely hard just to get through the day, sometimes I wonder what's the point in living. I have no friends anymore because I'm busy a lot with work, school and my family. While she is older, most of the time she can easily talk to people on the phone, have friends over. Not worry about much.  I have literally nobody… I can't pay for my phone. I just need some words of wisdom just to get me through this…I can't take it anymore. :(
