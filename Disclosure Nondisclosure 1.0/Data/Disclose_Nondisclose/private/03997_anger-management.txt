Anger has become a growing problem for me. My boyfriend has been bringing it up that it has been causing an increasing number of issues in our relationship. At first I was getting angry at him, but I have no idea why. I think, to me, it felt like he wasn't paying attention to me, not that he was ignoring me, but that he wasn't even trying to learn what kinds of thing irritate me, or like he wasn't trying to undertand what was frustrating me. And lately it has become more broad than just getting angry with him. I just graduated from college, and I have a 45 minute drive to work and since I started working, I've been getting bad road rage trying to get to work. I also get really frustrated with having to do things outside of work. I'm rooming with my cousin and I am always cleaning up after her. I feel like it shouldn't have to be my responsability to clean up after her. I'm 23 and unmarried, and maybe I'm feeling a little selfish, but I feel like right now I should only have to take care of myself.
 I think I also have a problem with confrontation which is why I have these anger episodes. It never happens in front of anyone but when my cousin is spending the night at her boyfriends and I am stuck in an apartment with her dirty dishes (like tonight), I get so angry that I start destroying things (broke a couple of dishes while I was cleaning up her mess). I hate arguing so much that I'd rather just deal with it myself than cause an argument, and I think I'm stressing myself out by putting so much weight on my own shoulder. This is the same with my parents, I always preferred to pay for things or deal with things by myself than accept help from them and then have to listen to their critique of me or have to do what they wanted me to...I preferred to spend my own money so I could do thing my own way.
 How to I start confronting people in a healthy way so that I am not putting all these burdens on myself?
