They were things that made me uncomfortable or violated my boundaries. I was not raped but on different occasions had been seen naked by my dad when I was a teenager, and also he pinched me on my bottom when i was 11 when I had just gone to give him a hug when my mom was mad at me. Never thought he had thought of me sexually before that incident and it was shocking and I thought I actually saw my mind physically sinking like there was a small black hole there. I almost couldn't believe what happened, I knew for sure he shouldn't do anything like that. My mother was horrible and was silent when I told her, like she wasn't listening.  A few days ago, now 17 years later from the incident, I repeated it till she listened and she said some things that made me very angry, like "maybe he was just playing" or "are you sure". I told her they were both sick in the head if they thought sexually harassing someone was playing. My brother had dismissed it a long time ago too. Its sad that my family doesn't really give support.

Is writing me a letter wonder what's in there. But it's been so much sadness and anguish trying to deal with this is like roadblocks all along my life, I had to work through I'll health caused by this, physical symptoms like heavy periods low blood pressure extreme pain/cramping near fainting it's scares me and I don't want dreams where he touches me. Trying to get councelling again but really doesn't help if it's just about "moving on" in life. I do, but it doesn't mean i dont get stifled by nightmares or have to cry when I describe it.How do you deal with your memories?
