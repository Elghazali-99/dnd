I have been trying to get my wife into treatment and I keep running into roadblocks that makes it difficult for caring family from helping a family member with BPD get help. Of course the biggest obstical is the BP does not belive they need help and any discussion of this topic only causes them to lash out, but all the programs require me to get her permission to talk to me or even to make an appointment for her. 
She is aware that she has this condition but after six monthes in a DBT program almost three years ago they had a "graduation" party for the group so she believe she has learned all she needed and because of a small mistake of mine (taken out of context and overblown) she concludes it must not have done any good if I am going do what I did?!?!?
I got her into the program last time by just making an appointment at a DBT clinic and just telling her it's her choice to go or not and I will go with her to the evaluation but then she would have to continue under her own steam. I backed off completely not even asking about it and crossed my fingers. It worked.  She started to become a different person until I did somthing she thought was a "major" betrayal then it all became worse after that.
 Anyway this clinic and others won't  allow me to "get the ball rolling for her" the intake nurses seemed to be hair trigger about medical privacy rules and seem to be anoied and offended that I would even call to help get her into the program. You would think that if they work with people with this condition they would try to understand what it is I'm trying to fo for her and help. 
It's easier to get help for an alcoholic the a BP!
 More importantly how do I approch my wife about getting started with DBT?  
How can I encourage her to go back into the program.
