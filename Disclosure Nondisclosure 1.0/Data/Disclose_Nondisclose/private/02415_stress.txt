Hi guys,
 I joined here because I'm at my wits end with this condition, it started about two years ago and I cant shake it off, I'm constantly in a heavy fog.
 Problem, 
Basically I'm groggy all the time with various severity depending on what I eat or drink, it's like if I had a couple of alcohool drinks, not the fun feeling type..
I cant think straight, memory recall and concentration are terrible, I'm at the point where I cant plan driving from A to B, I have to google map everything in my own area, it's nuts.
Forget about reading a book, anything I read I cant remember the previous line.
 About me,
I'm 41, in good shape(about 14-15% body fat), workout 5 times per week, I try to eat well, tons of veggies, lean meats, avoiding gluten and milk products at the moment(started 3 months ago).
 What I've done about it,
I've seen countless doctors and they cant pinpoint the problem. 
Tests done:
Complete bloodwork, the usual TSH, Glucose, Iron, B12, Cal/mag, minerals, palette counts..etc all normal.
Head CT scan - normal.
Head EEG - normal.
Seen a ear specialist, tons of tests done for labs, meniere..etc all normal.
Last week I went to see a naturopath and she had me do a hormonal test panel, waiting for results.
 Triggers,
The following definitely worsen my condition, I go from feeling medium fog to completely spaced out in a matter of minutes (3-5)
 Diet drinks of any kind.
Coke, Pepsi, any regular soft drinks.
Crystal light.
Alcohol of course.
Sugar.
Anything with Caffeine.
Fruits.
Carbonated water (Club Soda).
Bread, Butter, Margarine.
 I can understand when I react to sugars or caffeine but carbonated water? Crystal light?
 Current meds,
Was put on Zoloft eight months ago, it does help me cope with this condition.
  So I'm putting this out there, might be a simple diagnostic but the doctors I've seen cant find one, suggestions welcomed.
 Thanks, Steve.
