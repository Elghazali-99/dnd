hi ya, i was in an abusive relationship on and off for 4 years with a man who didn't seem to care about my feelings or needs nor that of the childrens. he was jealous of my relationships with my family ie sisters and parents he would question me on my where abouts,. who i saw and who i talked to. he would constantly accuse me of being unfaithful to the point that he even accused his friends of coming to the house while he wasn,t there! which was not true because i would avoid speaking with his friends because i knew how he would react. he didn't believe that our baby was his. the biggest shock for me was while i was in labour at home he didn't bat an eyelid or even try to help me, i asked him to get my mom and he said NO i'm not fetching her. by the time we reached the hospital the baby was well on his way 15 minutes later he was born healthy and alert but with no thanks to him. he has never taken interest in our son never helped with looking after him i cope a hell of a lot better without him. he also bullied us all myself my son from previous relationship and even our young son he was also cruel to my pet dog! he made our lives unbearable. he always told me i was the one with problems and to a point i believed him. i had to leave for my childrens sake and for my sanity. please could you give me an insight as to why a human being can be this way with the people he said he loved most. as i could never work him out? not sure what catergery this fits into.
