Hello: I find it very disturbing that my 39 year old boyfriend sleeps with 9 year old daughter.  I find it discusting that he sleeps in his boxer's and the 9 year old very spoiled daughter sleeps with him.  At one time we were on vacation in Mexico with his family he kicked me out of the bedroom we were sleepin in at the sister's house to sleep with her because she cried and made her scene about her wanting to sleep with papi.  I walked into the room to get my stuff and when I turned on the light they were both holding eachother real close it looked awful he had no shirt and I was discusted.  He tells me I am jeleous and selfish, I am not I just think it's not healty or normal.  I have 2 daughters and they spent time with my ex-husband their father and never in this world did he sleep with them and if I was ever told by my daughter's or him that he slept in the same bed, I would not ever allow them to spend the night.  Please advise me am I at wrong?  I have asked several different people for their opinion they all agree with me when I discussed this with him he of course got extremely irrate and said he spoke to his co-worker ( a man) and he told him he thought I was wrong and it perfectly normal and okay for him to sleep with the daughter.  I am sure his co-worker wasnt told all the other stuff that I see.
