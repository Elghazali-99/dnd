Hi, I don't know if anyone can help with my question or not but I'll try.  I have a 7 yr old son that I have had full custody of since he was born (the father denied he was the father from the beginning until he took the dna test), he would see my son off and on, basically when he felt like it.  He was cheating on me when we were together and left me for her when I found out I was pregnant, they now have a son together and she had a daughter from a previous relationship...(little background).  Anyways, when my son was about 21/2-3 I suspected that he was being physically abused by either his dad his dads girlfriend or both.  The last visit my son had with his dad he came home with some really suspisious marks, the next day I brought him to the doctor and it was reported.  There were police, detectives, and child protection involved, it was later determined that my son was in fact abused in his fathers home.  Charges were brought against him by the state.  He took a plea and walked with probation.  This was almost 5 years ago.  The court ordered supervised visits to him, which he has not exercised, not even attempted.  He has not seen or talked to his son in almost 5 years.
So, here's my question..would I be wrong to ask him to sign over his rights to my son?  I am getting married next year to a man that I have been with for the last 5 years, he loves my son to death and vise versa.  We've tossed around the idea of him adopting my son, but my sons father would need to sign over his rights.  My son and my fiance have an awesome relationship.  Is this something I could consider?
Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
