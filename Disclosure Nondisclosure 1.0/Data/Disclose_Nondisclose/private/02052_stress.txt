I am constantly exposed to a noisy work environment. The noise comes from loud vocalizations (VERY LOUD) on a daily basis. I work 16 hours per day as a live-in, 12 days straight, with every other weekend off. When I say constantly exposed, I really mean it. Every time I hear a loud vocalization (I estimate it being every 3-5 minutes throughout my 16 hour shift), I can feel my body tense with each vocalization. Or cringe, if you that's what you want to call it. I do not mind the laughter, and happy vocalizations, only the negative, demanding vocalizations which are mostly behavioral. I have noticed my anxiety over the years has increased significantly since working at this place. I can't go to a restaurant without feeling anxious and when I am in a room full of people and it is TOO quiet, I feel very uncomfortable (as if "quiet" isn't normal, or maybe something I am not used to anymore). I can't concentrate on many tasks and I've lost a lot of motivation for my job (although I still have a great deal of passion). I've noticed I have a very hard time sleeping at night, and rest is something I absolutely need for my 16 hour shifts. Has this noisy environment contributed to these changes in my emotional/mental/physical health? Can you please list the medical conditions that constant exposure to noise pollution can lead to? Thank you very much.
