Dear All,
 I have battled eczema almost my entire life. I'm 23 this year. It has left many unsightly scars. I tried to get rid of them using like whitening creams, 2% salicylic acid creams but they don't seem to go away. its like already 3 years since my last episode and the scars are still there as if they never faded, I have it on my legs and arms area. I can't wear sleeveless shirts or short skirts without feeling so so insecure. I told my mother and she thinks I'm just over-reacting and being sad for no reason...I'm 23 and I never worn short skirts or sleeveless shirts before. Only time I did was in school cos knee length skirts are part of the uniform and I would feel so insecure. Plus I live in a tropical climate..sometimes I just don't go out because its hot and I would perspire alot when I wear long-sleeves and long pants to cover up. Its consuming me. on some days i will feel down. on certain days when I see that my scars have faded slightly i feel abit better. but 95% of the time i got no self-esteem at all. I don't date or try to fall in love because I feel very ugly and feel like i look like a monster and that my future bf/husband will find me ugly and leave me. so i feel its better to remain single (spares me from present anxiety and future heartache). I just want to know how to feel better in the meantime because the scars are not gonna fade anytime soon...please please help me. thank you.
