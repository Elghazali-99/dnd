I guess I don't understand why my husband of 20 yrs is so good to me and takes good care of me,but  if we are out in public shopping he will start screaming at me like I am a small child until I start crying and walk away.then he screams more when I just ask him to please stop he is embarrassing and humiliating me. feel so low people staring at me a lady coming up to me telling me she just felt so sorry for me.I stopped even going shopping with him for months.started going again after a about a year went last nite......I guess he thought we were just picking up dinner and I though were doing our weekly shopping...even tho I know we discussed getting our kids  afew things and doing our shopping but as usual I get I never said that! he told me we had food at home and all we have is eggs and bread!and canned veggies...he hates for me to buy food but if he does it is ok.so I put everything back I had picked out.he was mad he then wanted to keep it..I said no according to you we have food at home so I;m good.so I just bought the food for my kids.and left it at that and I informed him he would go back to doing the shopping of course he denied screaming at me humiliating me and makin me cry which was more screaming in the store, Finally I just said I'll be good  just please stop!then he said I didn't do anything!went home he had a pissed look on his face and bought  beer.i said I told him he was just gonna drink and then tell me what he really thinks about me,but he did not drink we watched a movie I ignored him then..... as usual he kissed me and apologized i said it was it was my fault just to get past it.then in his world everything was fine but in mine I just felt so bad and knowing that I cannot tell anyone because they get mad at me and say they see how good he is to me and how much he loves me I have some serious health issues and have to go to the doc alot well...he lost his job supposedly for missing so much work due to me well  I feel so bad and  still do  but I know he went in late for no reason just what time he felt like going and I know they got on to him and  he got 3 days unpaid off due to  it and was told to, be there on time,but I think the real reason he got fired was that for yrs he just went in late with no reason....now I refuse to let him be late due to my appts.!he has a different job now....really I live in a sad world...he never takes me anywhere he will never just say hey lets go out to a movie or a club  or anything I asked him why and he said that we never make plans he said I never ask to go anywhere or mention anything..of course got screamed at yet again because he says I need to let him know and my point was why don't he ever just want to go somewhere with me?OMG can't believe I am crying!...I get so angry everyone tells me what a great life I have he takes care of me and i need his medical ins I informed them I am fully capable of taking care of myself.I felt so bad my kids knew something was wrong when we dropped the food off to them...but don't have the greatest relationship with them if they now anything they will find ways to be men and use it against me somehow.know probably sounds crazy! Just really keep to myself mind my own business..sometimes I wonder what real happiness feels like??sure would not mind knowing:) anyways maybe I will figure things out someday!
