My wife is recovering from depression. 3 years ago she began treatment at as outpatient. The Dr. prescribed Luvox (I think the initial dosage was 50; it was cut to 25 about 1 year ago) which helped her work through the things causing depression and she is well on her way to recovery (by her own admission and I concur). She wants to stop the medication safely, but her doctor is reluctant to allow her to stop. FYI, we live in Japan and Japanese doctors are assured payment by Health Insurers by prescribing medication. [Please note that I not kidding, every doctor I have ever been to here has either prescribed or WANTED to prescribe some medicine.] In doing her own research and through a support group, she came to know the most depression patients are prescribed Luvox for only 6 months (here in Japan). We want to have a baby and met with the doctor last year in October, who all but assured us that by now my wife would be free from Luvox, but as he has not agreed to any changes in medication amount, my wife began taking things into her own hands. First was a drug holiday (6 days of medication, one day off). Over a period of months, she has been able to reduce the medication to 1/8 of one pill every other day.
 2 questions: 1) is it safe for her to cut the pills and take only part of a pill.
 2) when she goes for too long without taking the medicine, her symptoms are: dizziness, tightness in the back of her neck, and general malaise ... are these usual withdrawal symptoms?
 Finally, do you have any advice? Should we continue to 'avoid' pregnancy to the best of our ability?
 Thank you.
