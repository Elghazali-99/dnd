From the time I could walk I was a victim of incest by my two uncles. I also was sexually abused by a neighbor and one of my babysitters brothers. At the age of 18 I was raped. When my parents found out about the incest, they did talk to me about it one night, and that was the only time that it was ever brought up. My parents knew nothing about the rape. My sister was the one that took me to the hospital and then I went to live with her. When my dad was alive, I did not ever bring the subject up because it was his brothers and he just couldn't stand to talk about it. My mother on the other hand still continues to change subjects when I mention any of it. As of today, all of my abusers have passed away except one, and I have never seen him in many, many years.
 The reason I am telling you this, is that I do not know if this is normal, but I have never been to counselling and only had some issues with it when I got married over 20 years ago. I choose not to let these events ruin my life. I have gone on to have a very good marriage and had a wonderful child too. I do not get up everyday thinking of these events nor do I choose to. I feel that it is not right for me to blame everything that ever happens to me on my past.
 I was dealt a several bad hands when I was younger, but I choose to take my life away from me.
 My question is, do you think that by not letting this dictate my life that I am in denial?
