My sister at one time you couldn't ask for better. She is now 45 and for the past 3-4yrs. you just don't know what will throw her off. I guess she's been this way since childhoold but not as severe. Now she will call on the phone (I'm glad she's out of town) and rant and rave, call you names, everything is your fault, shes' going to report you (for what I don't know). At one time her daughter was driving they were talking normally, all of a sudden she got mad and literally punched her daughter in the face, told her to get out. They were on a major hwy. The daughter pulled over, got out. The next thing she knew my sister had got out and threw her purse at her and hit her right in the head. She also gets mad and grabs dishes off that wall. She just found out that her daughter was into drugs, she phoned fighting with me, saying it was all my fault, why didn't I tell her, I wanted her dead. I only see my niece once a yr, how am I supposed to know she's on drugs. The parents gave my niece 5,000.00 and she had it spent in 3mos. nothing to show for it. Would she not clue in then. To be quite honest with you after the last phone call, I told her she needed help and if I don't hear from her again, its not going to hurt my feelings. She's dead against pain pills, I have 3 pinched nerves, I am on RX for Percocet and Oxycotin, well I'm a druggie and thats all there is to it. She threatened her husband with divorce because he was on pain pills after having back surgery, same pills, and he needed them. He is now on something else but a narcotic non the less. Is she BPI or Schizophrenic/Manic. I'm not sure what she's capable of, so I'm keeping my distance. Can someone answer, please.
