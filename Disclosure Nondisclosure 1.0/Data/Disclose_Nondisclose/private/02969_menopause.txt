I had a total hysterectomy with ovaries removed 21 years ago due to endometriosis.  I was on HRT for over 10 years but stopped 7 or 8 years ago.  Instead I use an estrogen free long term vaginal moisturizer.  About a month or so ago when I put the applicator in I noticed some thick, chunky discharge attached to the applicator.  For some reason I thought maybe I had gotten some toilet paper stuck up there or something and I dismissed it.  This morning I put more of the moisturizer in and saw the same thing except the discharge was pink tinged.  
 The odd thing is that I haven't recently had sex, I have no itch, no odor and I've applied the moisturizer on other occasions since seeing the discharge a month or so ago without problem or residue.  I also don't have a problem with discharge in my underwear.  
 I'm calling to make an appointment with a gynecologist (haven't seen one in several years) but it takes forever to actually get an appointment.  Any ideas of what could be going on down there?
