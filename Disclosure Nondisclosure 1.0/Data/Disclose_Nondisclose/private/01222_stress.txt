Hi I don't know if I'm posting in the right section but here goes. I am 29 years old and was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in May of this year. I had been skipping doses of my medication because I had become hyperthyroid and I admitted to the doctor today that I had not been taking the medication as planned. She appreciated my honesty but it has meant that I have in effect gone against their advice and seemingly not trusted them.
 There are many reasons why I did - firstly because I have no job and I know that the moment my blood test results are normal and my doctor deems me fit I would be back to finding work and having no luck with interviews or even securing one.
 Secondly because I have been told various things by a complementary health therapist and she said that I had two food intolerances and she told me she could get me off the thyroid medication if I followed her advice.
 Thirdly my family have been giving me stress because they want me to get a job. The job market at the moment is still tough. I don't know how they expect to find work in such a tough economic climate.
 I would really like someone to understand as I feel I am going completely insane.
