My Father in law was diagnosed just this past week with carcinoid tumours which had metatasized to the liver.
 His primary symptom was lack of appetite and gurgling in the stomach.
 He has been on a lot of pain meds in the last few days and a treatment called octreotide.
 We recieved a call from him early Sunday morning advising we needed to get to the hospital ASAP. I s/w the nurse before going to see him and was given a summarization of the night previous where he became aggresive and was swinging his cane at one of the nurses. He had to be restrained. The nurse says at the time he was on nothing that should cause hallucinations.
 When we went to see my father in law he was begging us to take him home because he was convinced they were conducting experiments on him..his recreation of the night before was quite different, and it was clear some of it was based on hallucinations.
 I asked the nurse what she thought could cause this if not the medications..she thought maybe he had mets in his brain. this goes against my understanding on carcionoid tumours and carcinoid tumour syndrome.
 Any suggestions?
