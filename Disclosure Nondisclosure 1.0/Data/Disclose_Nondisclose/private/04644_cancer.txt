Hi
 I have been passing blood in my stools on and off for many years, the first time it happened was when I was around 21.  I am now 38.  In the last 2 or 3 years the blood has become more frequent and I have noticed that I am constipated on a regular basis.  The blood I have experienced has always been bright red, I get a stinging pain in the anal area and it does feel like a lump is there.
 I mean to finally go and see a doctor but I thought I would asks for some opinions.  I put it down to hemorrhoids or an anal fissure in the hope it would go away but I think over the last few years it has worsened.  This obviously sent alarm bells ringing in relation to colon cancer, mainly because my symptoms seem similar for that illness.  I have the blood in the stool, irregular bowl movements, constipation regularly, tiredness.
 Lately there has been no blood but I know that if a pass a large stool there will be, I have tried to watch my down to keep constipation at bay, so my stools have been fairly normal.  I think there is so much awareness about cancer now that it difficult to ignore these symptoms.  Does this sound like a simple case of hamorrhoids or should I be a bit concerned?
 Thanks for any advice.
