I don't know how much longer I can keep holding on... I don't get enough sleep- around 5 hours a night, if that. I'm constantly getting myself into new things, and have no time to slow down- I can't say no to people, and I am in charge of a lot of things. I'm in honors and AP classes (in high school), a lot of clubs(including officer positions in a few), sports, ASB... I'm thinking I might have OCD...   
Another problem I have is that I keep showing signs of bulimarexia- I go through cycles where I eat maybe 400 calories a day, and cycles where I eat around 800-1100 calories a day(but purge).
I'm thinking that all of this comes from family problems... My dad was never around until a few years ago when he went through a power trip then fell flat on his feet and became depressed. I believe my mother to be verbally abusive... somehow she always turns everything around so that it's my fault, she makes me feel like all of my accomplishments (and me in general) only drag her down, she has never been there for me emotionally (yet somehow she feels the need to take part in some of my decisions?). In short my dad has only ever provided us with a paycheck, and my mother has only ever provided by driving us places, and occasionally cooking meals (It was always fast food as long as I can remember).
The possible OCD, ED, and family issues are all becoming worse... how do I keep myself holding on? I want to quit...
