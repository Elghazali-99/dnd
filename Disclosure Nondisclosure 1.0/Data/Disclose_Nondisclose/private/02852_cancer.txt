Okay. Well I'm Madison, and I'm 17 years old. I have history of asthma, heart murmur. & nothing else that we know of. I've noticed that I'm paler than normal. I also bruise easily. I've even had a couple bruises on my back and wrist for no reason. I've had a couple bloody noses, very heavy periods and my gums bleed when I brush them (I do not brush them very hard.) I've had headaches almost every single day. I pass out when I stand up. I am having shortness of breath daily. Also, I came to the doctor about 4 weeks ago with a case of pneumonia. Took antibiotics. Came back 1 week ago with an unknown cause of infection. We knew I had an infection due to two painless, hard lymph nodes right beside each other in my neck by my jaw. I have no dental issues or other issues to cause them. Went I went to the doctor I had a low grade fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough with no mucus. They checked my lungs it sounded normal. I was given amoxicillin. I took two per day for 10 days and I just finished today. And the lymph nodes in my neck are still swollen. Could this mean Cancer, or something serious? What does it sound like and what should I do? Please reply quickly
