Ok here is my story
 I am currently in a long term relationship for over 10 months now and i get to see my partner for a few days every 5-6 weeks. When i am with him life is perfect and i have no cares or problems in the world
 As soon as we part i find my mood drastically dropping as the days go by to it gets to the point where i cant mentally function. I constantlly think of negative things about the relationship, myself, our future.
 He is amazing and we talk daily on the phone and IM and he knows im going through hell with it and he is coping better than i am, its like i cant manage without some kind of drama when hes not around. I am even thinking would it be easier on him if i let him go and make myself some how not love him 
 I cry almost every day and i am not happy with my home life (living back with my parents, unemployed) and i have alot of time on my hands which always tires me out cos i think about pointless negative things to much.
 I saw my local doctor 2 months ago and he says i have depression and that i should just work through it alone which hasnt helped. i have signed up with a threapist which i start 2mw also.
 I just feel bad for my partner and dont know if i should release him from all of my head dramas
 any advice would be much appreciated
