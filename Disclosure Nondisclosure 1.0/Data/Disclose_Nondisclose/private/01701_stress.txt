Hi I don't know if my situation will be well understood but I have had a lot of things going wrong for me lately. I have no job because I am currently off sick with a chronic illness that makes me tired and depressed and a lot of domestic problems are cropping up because of that, usually from family members not understanding my illnesses or why I have them. I also have had days where all I want to do is sleep, sit around and eat very unhealthy foods and I haven't even been taking my medication for any of my illnesses. 
 One of my friends pointed out to me today that I look as though I haven't slept in a week and last week I looked great, but I also had a very bad dream linked to one of the things that has gone so badly in my life and this dream made me wake up crying. I feel as though I am losing control and I have an appointment on Friday with my doctor, who I know will get angry with me for what I have been doing to myself. I just cannot seem to find a way to deal with the pressure but the strange thing is that I know that the way I have been dealing with it is not conducive. Does this sound at all odd? Thanks
