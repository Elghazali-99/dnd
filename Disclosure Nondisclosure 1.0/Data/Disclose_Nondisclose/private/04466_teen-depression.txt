I'm Miranda and I'm fifteen. Ever since the beginning of this year ive been falling apart more. Whenever a friend and I get in a fight I just break down crying, because I can't stand the fact that I'm mad at one of th people who matter most to me.  And most recently I was dating this really amazing guy he made me extremely happy. It was like I never felt up set about anything. Until the day he came over and accidentally left this poem his ex wrote to him saying that she loved him and missed him and all this stuff. I broke down u didn't come out of my room for a week. Normally this stuff woulnd bother me I usually confront the guy and ask about it. Yet this time I stayed crying and I just let everything good between us fall apart. The guy left me a week ago. Truns out he never felt anything he just wanted in my pants. But I honestly can't let go of him. It's all stupid I know. But on top of all of that I haven't gotten much sleep for the past 3 months. I haven't been eating which is really bad I know. I've also been getting really bad head aches and these panic attacks. The come at least 4 times a day. Should I be worried? Lastly I've given up on trying on everything. I've stopped trying in school, in soccer, and I've stopped trying to even look like I'm happy. I honestly don't know what I should do. 
 Should I try and get some help or should I just not worry bout any of it because maybe all teens go threw this??
