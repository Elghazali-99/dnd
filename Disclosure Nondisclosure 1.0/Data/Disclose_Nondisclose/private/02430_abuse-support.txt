I was sexually abused when i was ten years old by a boy a little older, i'm now eighteen. I really need to get this off my chest and talk to someone about this. It's hard for me to go into detail and i'm scared of talking to a professional face to face. My mum had noticed i was acting different and asked if i had been abused and i just nodded. Since then, it seems, she tries her hardest to pretend it didn't happen. I understand as no-one wants to hear it about their daughter. I approached her one day a few months ago asking for some advice because i was feeling lost and confused, she says there's nothing she can do. The images play in my mind like a broken record and never leave me. It tourchers me. I watch tv and the smallest things will remind me. I find it hard to show my partner affection and have sex without thinking this is just like being touched before. I want to move on a forget about it, even though i know it'll never go away, not properly. I feel uncomfortable when left alone with a man in a room, even my partners dad. I panic when the door closes. I feel so embarrassed. Thank you for reading.
