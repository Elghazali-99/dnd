i'm 18 and have been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. I've been taking effexor XR for the last 6 months. Lately i've noticed that my behaviour is changing; it's getting worse than it was before medication. Sometime's I'll fly into a rage and scream and yell at my family until sometime later when I realise that I had no reason to.Then i get so mad at myself that i'll repeatedly punch myself until it bruises. I also pick my skin compulsively till it bleeds then scars. I've also noticed that when I watch a movie or TV show that I really like, I tend to absorb my favourite character's mannerisms, gestures and overall personality. It's like i'm trying to compensate for my lack of personality by adapting anothers... I always feel like something's missing... but i'm not quite sure what... I'll also spend days just crying for no reason...
 I've read about BPD and recognise some symptoms and behaviours in myself. I'm not trying to diagnose my self or anything, I just want to get opinions from others as to what this could be...
 Please help...
