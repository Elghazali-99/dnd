Hello.  I'm new to this forum and am looking for some helpful advice.  For a while now I have been wondering if I am suffering from depression -- though I really don't know what symptoms come along with a diagnosis.  I am 38 years old, have a wife, three kids, nice home, and a decent job.  All the normal ingredients for a happy life.  So why don't I feel so happy?  I remember being younger and feeling so ambisious and full of life.  Now I just feel dull and somewhat emotionless -- not necessarily sad.  Here are some things I've noticed and am planning to talk with my GP at my appointment in a few weeks.
 - lack of energy, feeling tired most of the time
- lack of motivation at home and on the job
- loss if interest in things I used to enjoy doing
- change in mood and behavior (I have become very short tempered and have frequent outburst of anger for seemingly very small reasons in hindsight)
- loss of libido
- would rather be left alone most of the time (I used to be a very social person)
- forgetful
 Are these symptoms? Are there others I should be looking for?  Anything else I should ask the Dr.?
 I should mention that I have been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea and a Vitamin D deficiency for which I take daily supplements.  No loss of appetite, no insomnia, no weight loss, or excessive anxiety.  Just not feeling like the same person I remember being some days -- and I'd like to get back there.  Any advice or thoughts are welcome and appreciated.
