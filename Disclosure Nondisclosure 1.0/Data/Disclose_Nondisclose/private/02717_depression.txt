Hello everyone. So a long story short, I have always suffered from anxiety and very bad depression. Life has been unfair to me and lately I have been finding it hard to cope. After a very mentally draining event, I just wanted to feel numb. So I decided to take 12 Tramadol's. (50mg each) I regretted it within a few hours. I was dizzy, shaky, having chills and sweats, felt exhausted and couldn't eat without barfing. I just felt plain horrible. The next day, I woke up and felt better, but still couldn't eat and felt very depressed. "Much more depressed than usual." I knew something was wrong, but I figured I would give my body another day to recuperate. Here I am two days later, and I feel so depressed and down. I am worried because I was doing "okay" until I took the Tramadol. I am very worried and was wondering are feelings of deep depression/anxiety common after abusing drugs like Tramadol? I know it is an opiate, so maybe a serotonin over load or something? ): I also still feel sick to my stomach. Any help would be greatly appreciated! "Also I am aware of my stupid decision and plan on never, ever doing it again.'
