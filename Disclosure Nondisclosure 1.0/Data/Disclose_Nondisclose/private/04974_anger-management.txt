I am an 18 year old male who is usually a calm person and it takes a lot to anger me but when i do get angry its explosive. However if you challenge my opinion or express an opinion on a topic i feel passionate about or even just disagree with I will go full speed ahead to prove you wrong. I always have to be right and will continue arguing even if the other person stops. This has lead to my closest friends telling me, in the heat of an argument about something really trivial, that if i got a wife she would kill me one day. Obviously this was said in the heat of the moment but upon reflection i can see that my need to argue and to be right could get me in trouble one day. If an argument  i ever going badly I will make desperate attempt to flip it on its head or bridge to a topic i can argue better. This has lead to one friend never disagreeing with me ever and another disagreeing with me all the time because he doesn't see why my opinion should be the only one. Even at home i realized today that i am the cause of most arguments even if i'm not involved. It has been pointed out that i will often wind people up to the point of arguing then disappear to my room while the argument continues. Today i went for a long walk and came to the conclusion that i need to change or leave and start afresh. Are there any tips to help me realize i don't have to always be right and accept other peoples views? I apologize if this isnt in the correct place
