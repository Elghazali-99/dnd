My daughter is 4 years old and is having a hard time understanding why her father isn't a part of her life. I used to live in Ca. I had been with her father for a few months but had known him for a few years. When I was five months pregnant I moved to TN to live with my parents for financial reasons and because her father had made it pretty obvious to me that he wasn't ready to be a good dad. Two weeks after I moved he was arrested and this was when i finalized my decision to never go back to him. I made him aware of this decision but also told him that I hoped he would do what he could to be there for his daughter. Since this time he has made no efforts to see her and refuses to see her anytime my daughter and I take trips to CA. He accuses me of being crazy and that is why he won't see his daughter; "it isn't worth it to me to see her if it means I have to see you" has been his response. So, basically... I don't see him being in her life anytime soon, if at all. He blames the whole situation on me and seems to be incapable of taking any responsibility. My daughter cries periodically about him not being here and I try my best to console her. How do I explain to a 4 year old that their dad isn't in their lives without making them hate their father? I don't know if he will ever be a part of her life or not and don't feel that it is right explaining his choices when they don't even make sense to me. She asks me to call him but contacting him in the past has never resulted in anything positive for myself or my daughter. I just want to know the best way to address this issue without giving her false hope of killing any chance of seeing him positively. Is this even possible?
