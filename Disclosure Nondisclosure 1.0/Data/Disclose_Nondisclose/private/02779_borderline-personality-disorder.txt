ok so my friend and i have somehow created this fantasy world, like we believe were psychic in a way, like we think everything we see in our fantasy world is actually going to happen, and sometimes it does. we spend a lot of time in this world, we believe we "have to do things" or cant be at certain places because "we're not suppost to" on a normal day we laugh at this and think we're just crazy, but theres some days where we like fall into a trip and we put off all other responsibilities trying to piece together our fantasy world. I then realized that i have always had a fantasy world, kind of like imaginary friends, i have a fantasy family , i have a mom a dad brothers and sisters, and sometimes i sit in my room and get very deep into my fantasy world, everyone in my fantasy family has a personality , even i have  a different personality in my fantasy world. i have been doing this for years now, i tend to do it when im sad or feeling anxiety, whenever i am beside myself i just go into my fantasy world and everything is ok, but i am beginning to think this is very unhealthy .. does all of this mean im mentally ill ? or is this normal ?
