I'm 13 and think I'm depressed
 by chazzhope, 10 hours
ok so I'm 13 my parents split up when I was 4 I lived with my mum untill I was about 9, I've been relatively happy for the whole of my life until now. 
me and my dad moved to Croydon because he was getting married however I don't want to go. two years later and I'm 13 and feeling so depressed that I can't see a purpose for life anymore, i used to be quite loud in class but since about a year ago it all changed, I'm constantly getting questioned about my sexuality. To the point where Ive given up on relationships, I've told my parents everything but they think it's just 'the teen stage' every day I can hardly get up in the mornings, I just feel like crying. I've got a eating dissorder (I starve myself) I feel so insecure. I let people do what they like to me I don't care about my body anymore. Ive self harmed for about 6 months, Ive started smoking because i feel like it gives me relief and take tension away. I just want all the pain to end! I've had enough!:'( I've attempted suicide before. 
Please I need all the advise I can get at the moment!
