i promised i would not write about this again.  i could not be helped.  Well i tried so hard to fake things were fine. But i just cant take any more.  everything i say is wrong she is already right when she even knows she is wrong.  it is so exhausting having to go through this every day. of course it is my fault.  i took my pills this morning.  and i had an argument with my nece about quit talking down to me like i am stupid or something.  i found a bottle of vodka and had a mixed drink.  i stayed in my room.  i fell asleep.  my young niece called her car had broke down and they wanted to come back here.  they are visiting for a week my grandson stayed 3 weeks with us.  that woke me up she  told me to tell them she had taken her pills and could not drive to get them.  she is supposed to get them in the morning.  i am sitting here wondering what do i have to live for.  you give me advise but there are no answers.  i am drinking and i am not feeling a thing.  cant even go to sleep.  i just want to go to sleep and be left alone and not ran down every single day.  i got to see my sister.  on fathers day they called and asked us to come.  i dont want to go on.  i dont know if i have the nerve to do something or not. i hope so.  i want to go be with my family.  i am so lonely i hurt. when i get my pain pills maybe i can use them and just go to sleep.  why am i herr why does god hate me.  why did he take everyone i loved away. leave me with users that only want my money and what i have. i just give up.  god bless you all.  hope your life turns out better than mine has.  mandy876
