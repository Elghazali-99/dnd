Well ;i have and old problem that grind my nerves in a wa.When i was in primary school;they looked at me with disgrace;as well in middle/highschool.In general they exclude me;they insult me and reapeat some phrases that insult me(your an idiot;ape;parrot;velociraptor ;retard ;etc)like autistic persons.I learned myself a long;long;long time ago that i'm not the core of the world and universe so i don't beg for attention.
I'm lonely and i stay all the day in my home.My parents tell me to stay outside;but god knows;since i dont have friends.I love fishkeeping;dinosaurs(birds;stegosaurus;velociraptors)and nature.My parents hate me because of that hobbies i have.At the beggining of the year;my teacher call all the parents for a meeting to discuss some problems of the class(before that all boys and girls didn't hate me).After that 
meeting;next morning they were totaly different;shouting all bad ideas about me. .........What's wrong with me?!Im a nice person who didn't was selfish;egoist;idiot or anything bad....
