I'm new to the world of depression. My girlfriend sent me this story about depression as her way of communicating how she felt. It caught me off guard to say the least. I do not have nor suffer from depression myself. I have no experience with it, until now. I have been reading as much as I can about the condition to better understand how depression effects her. She was starting to come back around, but I got the dreaded "I need some time alone statement in a text that also said something went down at work, and she left. She had been complaining about things at work for days. I do not work with her and have no idea what actually happened. We do not live together either. So, with that, I could use some insight.  I want to be supportive, but I'm not sure how in this situation. Do I give her space, or not? If I do give space, should I wait for her to contact me, or do I reach out first? If I reach out, what angle should I take? When I say angle I mean, do I ask how she is doing, or just let her know I'm still here reassuring her I'm by her side? Thank you in advance for any input.
