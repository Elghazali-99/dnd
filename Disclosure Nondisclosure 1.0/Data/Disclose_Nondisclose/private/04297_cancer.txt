My father has been diagnosed with Colon Rectal Cancer, stage 4. He is only 47 years old. His height is 5'10. He has not had had any medical history ( no medical record). The doctors have said that he has a few spots on his liver which have recently shrunk with chemotherapy (he only had two Chemotherapy's so far). My doubt is does my father really have colorectal cancer stage four because he has never had any pain or nausea. Yes, he has started having pain ever since Chemotherapy started, but before he did not have any. Chemotherapy is making him weaker (losing weight and hair fall). 
 More information about his Colon Cancer: His sister had it, but besides his sister no one has ever had it in his family, ever. He only has a few spots on the liver for which doctor recommended Chemotherapy. For the rectal cancer, they said Surgery would be the best option.  The cancer that was spread to the liver only was NOT spread through the blood. Everything else is fine in his body. His liver has no pain, never had any, ever. Now, it is shrinking. 
 My question: Does he really have rectal colon cancer stage four. We have not received second opinion yet, but we would like to.  Can there be mistakes in diagnosis? How serious is his cancer? Is this curable. Furthermore, his WBC, all of sudden shrink whenever Chemotherapy is given to him- otherwise, they are fine. Is his Chemotherapy killing him more? If his liver has shrunk, then can doctors take the rest off via surgery? Please explain his staging and whether it is curable.Also, advice on a second opinion. Has anyone gone through this type of cancer and staging before?
