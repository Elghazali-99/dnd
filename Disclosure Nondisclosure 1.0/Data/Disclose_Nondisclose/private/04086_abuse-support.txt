I had a mom who runs a daycare call me today and tell me she is worried about my son and his daycare provider.  I know this person through a mutual friend.  She said that she often run's into my daycare provider and that she thinks my provider is too harsh on the children.  She said the kids had their shoes off at the mall play place and my daycare provider freaked out on them, spoke to them like they were 20 year olds, pulled them up by their arms, and really scarred my son.  She told me that one of the other providers also feel's that my provider is too harsh on the kids.  She said that she knew she was putting her reputaion on the line and my day care provider would figure out it was her who called my, but she felt she needed to call me and tell me what she had seen.  She also said that if it was her child she would move them to a different daycare.  I know my daycare provider is very strict and I do not mind this, but I have noticed recently that my son does not want to go to her house in the morning.  He seems fine once I get there, but has been giving me a hard time in the morning.  I feel like since I got this phone call that I am a bad mom if I don't take him out of his current daycare.  I would really like to investigate more, but I don't trust my 2 1/2 year old to tell me the truth.  Any suggestions on how to go about this?
