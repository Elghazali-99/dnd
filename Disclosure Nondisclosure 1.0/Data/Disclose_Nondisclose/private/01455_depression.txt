I'm 21 and am a complete failure at life. I dropped out of uni because I couldn't hack it. I have no friends, am broke, still living with my parents. I'm a virgin and have never so much as touched a girl in an intimate way. 
I apply for simple jobs like kfc, mcdonalds but even then my application gets rejected. I don't even know what i'm doing wrong.
 So I just sit around all day drinking and wallowing in self pity since I literally have nothing.
 I also happen to suffer from OCD and always some kind of anxiety which only encouraged the onset of my depression. 
 I'm so lonely and feel so worthless that it's becoming unbearable. The only way I used to be able to get to sleep soundly at night is by imagining I was dead and free of all of this misery and suffering.
 But that just doesn't hack it anymore, and I think the only way I can truly achieve any mental peace as by ending it all right here. 
 What's most painful is the way I see some guys younger than me who have it all - they are small, weak, ugly yet they drive around in top of the range sports cars and get girls effortlessly. They some to live life so gracefully, getting everything they want without even really trying yet I can't even get a job flipping burgers.
 It's obvious no girl will ever want a loser like me, and i'm about as good as invisible to the world and i'm sick of it all. I need all the pain to end. But how? As you have probably gathered by now I am a coward as well as a failure, so I don't think I want to deal with anymore pain than I already feel even though it is ''only'' emotional pain. Having acheieved nothing at such an age, I have absoultely nothing to live for; nothing to lose. I clearly have such crappy genes that I actually wished i'd never even been born.
