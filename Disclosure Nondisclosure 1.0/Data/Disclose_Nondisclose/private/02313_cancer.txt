Hi, I'm just wondering if anyone has experience of something similar and could give me some advice. A couple of weeks ago I was admitted to hospital for a night because I had a dull ache in the right of my chest (really very minor) and when they tested my blood my d-dimer came back at 978. They were worried I could have PE, although I was breathing fine and had no other symptoms so they ran a chest CT and it showed no PE but a 'rather angular' area of soft tissue at the base of my right hilum, about 3cm in diameter. They say it's probably just a cluster of nodules and tissue but that they cannot rule out a potentially significant lesion. They said I should have another CT in 2-3 months time. I'm just worried in case it is significant and whether waiting that long is a good idea if so. I am a 44 year old female former smoker. I quit about ten years ago but smoked about 20 a day for around 15 years. My father and my grandmother both died of cancer (though nothing lung related). Can anyone give me any advice? I am trying not to worry but it's proving quite hard. I still have the slight ache in my chest. Thank you for your help.
