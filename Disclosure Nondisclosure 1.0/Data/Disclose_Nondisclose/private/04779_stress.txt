Hey everyone,
I really need some advice last Thursday I got a call from my fiances father saying my fiancé and father to my 6 month old was shot in the jaw. Long story short. Because we are not married and our daughter isn't 16 or older we are at the bottom of the ladder and haven't had much control over this tragedy. As far as seeing him its up to when his parents say I can come because the icu has a code and I do not have it. Not only that, but we do live together and our bills were paid by my fiancé. Now I'm scared that they will want my fiancé to come home with his parents instead of me. Although I did talk with a victim crisis line and they had said that since ryan is an adult he gets to make decisions but he isn't aware of the way I've been treated. I'm sick to my stomach knowing I could loose him. Please will some tell me what I can do regain  some control?? I really love my fiancé I have tried talking to his father and letting him know I want him to come home with me and I don't get a response and if I do he says its up to my fiancé. 
 Please will someone help me? I'm going through a nightmare.
