I have been diagnosed with chronic paranoid schizophrenia by a psychiatrist.  I was wondering if it were worthwhile to see a psychiatrist ASAP with the following.  Possibly to get my medication increased or changed.  I take 20mg of Abilify for psychosis and 100mg of sertraline for anxiety and I guess negative symptoms.  I noticed lately I am occasionally having trouble joining the words of sentences together into one piece.  I also feel a huge disconnect between my emotions and mind resulting in me having not desire to even act on them more and more as the days pass.  Things are also appearing more "grey" to me rather than colorful.  Not literally, but rather, I'm losing the ability to feel pleasure in things.  I feel like everything is starting to feel robotic rather than biological, and I'm starting to look at everything as IF, THEN like in programming.  (IF something happens, THEN this happens)  I am viewing life as IF born, THEN die.  Not because I'm depressed or want to die or find life pointless or anything, but rather, I just see that's the end result of being born.  I also have trouble speaking sometimes.  Such as a few days ago I said "That's... kinda... funny." and someone asked me to do something and my brain refused to respond to the thing they requested of me, so I just sat there staring vacantly.  I also am sometimes feeling dissociative like I am watching myself as a third party as I do things.
 As a side note I proofread this and my sentences look like a load of sentence fragments, rather than complete sentences, which I normally write long winded sentences.
