I was on antipsychotics for nearly a year, my new psychiatrist has taken me off them. I have a bipolar type mood disorder and I've been feeling very low the past few days. Last night I went to self harm. I held the knife to my wrist and started to cut. This powerful thought that wasn't my own thought (hard to describe) came in to my head. It wasn't me thinking it, it was something else putting it in to my head and it told me to put the knife to my throat and press. The knife was blunt so it didn't do anything but then I kept getting a thought that I didn't want to think. My cat was next to me and this thought was saying to harm the cat and it was frightening. I could fight against it though and instead I let her out of my room and shut the door. I just want an explanation for this. I read something and it kind of describes how the thought came to my head: when you get a song lyric stuck in your head you don't choose to repeat it over and over again in your thoughts but you do as if there is no control over it. That's kind of how my experience was. Should I tell my psychiatrist or just pass it off as no biggy?
