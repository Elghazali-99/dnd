I know I asked this before, but never got alot of answers. My eleven year old son was sexually abused by his friends father quite often. He refused to tell my husband and I what was going on and eventually peaked when he cut his arm and had to get taken to hospital because he lost so much blood. A few weeks later he overdosed on painkillers, he had to get his stomach pumped. He is now so angry that he locks himself in his room all day, very suspicious about any strange men and follows me everywhere I go. He's paranoid and cant concentrate at school. He has been diagnosed dyslexic and does see a therapist every week. Some extra info: My son kept on going back to this mans house because he threatened to kill him (he has now disappeared).I was abused by my grandfather for 4 years when I was 3, I have cut myself from the age of 12 to 20 and I have never really trusted anyone since. I have never told my children about this and only my husband knows, how can I help him through this? Should I tell him about my history and that I know what he's going through? Please help, this is getting really out of control now...
