I am starting my weaning from effexor tomorrow.  After all I have read I am a bit nervous about it!  Im currently on 225mg and going to 187.5mg tomorrow.  Ive recently detoxed from vicoden and I want to try to get off the effexor too just to see what I really feel like!!!  I can say that my pain that I originally started the vicoden for has all but gone away!  Still some aching in my back but nothing like it was while I was on them!  So Im hoping that getting off the effexor will help me to be able to "feel" again!  I am a little scared that the depression will come back once I am off but I guess Ill cross that bridge when I come to it!  Im still taking Ativan for anxiety so that will be my next med to stop after the effexor.  I have a long road ahead!!!!  I just wonder if the depression came from the back pain for so long and the anxiety came from worrying about all of it!!!  Im hoping that I will be free once I get off everything!!!  Just thought Id post for some support and encouragement in the days and weeks to come!!!   Karen
