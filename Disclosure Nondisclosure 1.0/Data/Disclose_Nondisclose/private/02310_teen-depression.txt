My son is almost 15 years old. He is very smart, athletic, good-looking, and popular. He is often depressed and very moody. He has no environmental issues that should cause his depression. By this, I mean, his father and I are happily married. There are no problems in our family such as abuse, etc. We live a comfortable lifestyle and he pretty much gets all the material things he wants. We are a very happy, church-going family with a lot of love between us.
 I myself have suffered from depression all my life. It runs rampant on my side of the family. I know that it is genetic and that it has been passed to my poor boy.
 My question is: what kind of medication (if any) others would suggest? My doctor wants to put him on Prozac. Neither my son, or my husband and I want that.
 My doctor said that is the only one apporved for teens. But I know other teens on other medications, such as Effexor.
 Can anyone give me some advice? And would he benefit from a therapist? Or not? Since there isn't anything environmental that causes his depression. (he himself has said this---that he has no idea why he feels so sad and bad)
 Please help.
