I'VE BEEN WIT MY BF ON AND OFF FOR ABOUT 4 YRS NOW. WE JUST RECENTLY HAD A BABY AND IM TO THE POINT WHERE I CANT TAKE THE EMOTIONAL ABUSE ANYMORE. I'VE TRIED SO HARD TO SIT BACK AND KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT BECAUSE I WANTED MY BABY TO HAVE A FATHER IN HER LIFE, UNLIKE ME. ALL THRU MY PREGNANCY HE MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS LOWER THAN DIRT. HE CALLED ME DA MOST HURTFUL NAMES AND WHEN I WOULD CRY HE WOULD LAUGH AND TELL ME I SHOULD LEARN HOW TO SHUT MY ******* MOUTH. N MY 8 MONTH WE GOT INTO IT N DA CAR AND HE TRIED TO PUT ME OUT ON SOME ROAD. I WOULDNT GET OUT SO HE GRABBED MY ARMS AND PULLED ME OUT THRU THE DRIVER SIDE CAUSING ME TO HIT THA ARMREST AND STEERING WHEEL. IM THINKING DOESNT HE REALIZE IM BIG AND PREGNANT. NOW OUR BABY IS HERE AND THINGS R STILL DA SAME IF NOT WORST. HE USES THA BABY AGAINST ME AND I JUST FEEL HELPLESS. I WATCHED MY MOTHER B ABUSED BY MY STEP FATHER AND TO DIS DAY I CAN STILL CLOSE MY EYES AND REMEMBER HER CRIES AS WELL AS HER BEATINGS. I DONT WANT MY DAUGHTER TO REMEMBER THA SAME. I LOOK AT HER AND I KNOW I SHOULD LEAVE BUT THEN I THINK ABOUT HER GROWING UP AND HATING ME FOR NOT HAVING A FATHER N HER LIFE. WILL SHE UNDERSTAND Y I MADE THE DECISION OR WILL SHE FEEL LIKE I DID....UNWANTED. I JUST NEEDED TO WRITE THIS SO I COULD CLEAR MY HEAD. SORRY IF I SOUND SO PITIFUL :)
