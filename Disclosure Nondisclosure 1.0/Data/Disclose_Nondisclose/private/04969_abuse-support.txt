Im going to get straight to the point. My sons father remarried and is now living with a woman I have barely met. My son came home from his week long visit at his fathers house and has been exhibiting signs which is making me think one of them is molesting him. He pulls his shirt up then tries to pull mine up and asks if we can rub bellies, while I was laying in bed and watching a movie he climbed up over me and was attempting to dry hump me, every time he wants to kiss me he puts his hands behind my head, closes his eyes, opens his mouth and starts moving his head side to side, and when I tell him no mommy and kids don't do those things he immediately asked me if we could play "White Wedding" and kiss each other a lot. So I immediately called the police and social services. There reply to me was because there was no physical evidence found during his exam its considered here say and they wont be investigating it any further. Ive tried getting the child advocacy center for abused children in my area to please investigate this and there answer was the same, without physical evidence they cant investigate this any further. When it was time for my son to go back his father used our court order against me and I had to take him back there. When I told my son he had to go to his dads house he started crying hysterically and then wet himself and pooped himself. Im on the verge of taking this matter into my hands because my son refuses to talk to these people about whats being done to him and theres no physical signs of sex no one will help. I feel like a failure of a mother because without kidnapping my son or getting rid of his father/stepmother I cant help him. If anyone knows any other agencies that would be willing to help please let me know. I live in Frederick county Virginia.........
