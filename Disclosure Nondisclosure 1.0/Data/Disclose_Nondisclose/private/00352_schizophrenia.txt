I have a few questions I need answered. I went out drinking with my friend and I have schizophrenia. I also have been taking medication risperdal. Well the night I went drinking I missed my dose of risperdal came back the next day hungover but I wasn't hearing any voices yet. Then around 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon I still hadn't taken meds and I started to hear the voices that I had the first time I had when I was diagnosed they basically came back. I took my risperdal which did help with the voices but did not completely get rid of them it's been two days and the voices are very faint but I can still hear them. So my question is do I have to go back to the er again or will they go away after a while since the meds do seem to be helping. I'm just scared because I don't want to get locked up again in the mental institution since I know now that I'm really schizophrenic. My second question is is this going to increase my dose of risperdal or medication that I'm going to 've on. I know I'm stupid for drinking but I didn't take my pills because I thought the mix of risperdal would be bad for my kidneys. I didn't know one day of drinking and missed dose of meds could do this. Please anybody with a similar experience who could give me some advice would be help. I just recently diagnosed schizophrenic and the voices are tolerable since they're faint but I'm sad they're back and worried they won't go away. I have a doctor's appointment next month if I tell her the voices are back will I get put away or should I keep this to myself. They're not so bad but they are upsetting
