I am currently 20 years old and this is what is what happend when i was 15 years old. My mum friend and and my mum were having a chat and  I was told to keep my mum friend niece 8 years old occupied while they had a chat. i was curious about girls body and i touched on her privates. i didnt force her or anything but i felt so ashamed of what i did that i kept away from her even when my mum friend told me to look after her as i knew i might do it again, if im with her. I had no idea what i was doing was wrong and feel so terrible and sad as i wish i never had done this. i need advice about what i should do as this guilt is making me feel like a rapist? i havent told my mum or anyone about this as i was really scared at that time and now i feel really ashamed of what i did. i still see my my frined niece but i always feel awkward when talking to her and seems always happy talking to me but i just cant get over of what i did to her. 
  Also when i was 12 years old i went through pornographic material on my brothers laptop and i felt really ashamed and i told my mum and she told me not to do it again. and when i was little my  brother touched me inappropriately but i don't have grudge on him or anything but i read in some forum some people who something similar happened to them acted like the way i did and i just want to know what i should do. i genuinely really care for her and all my life i never did anything bad or wished anything bad on anyone. for all this time i kept it bottled in me but now i feel like worst people in the world and i don't know what to do?
