Hi all
This is my first time posting in this Particular forum. I hope im posting in the right one (wasnt sure if i should post in substance abuse forum) my question relates to an anti depressant/sleeping pill remeron 15mgs. I was diagnosed with opiod dependance, went through rehab, detox the whole 9 yards (I hope this doesnt offend anyone, i need to give a brief history of where im at). I had anxiety and depression that i never experienced in my life. So the doctor prescribed me remeron a little over a month ago.
 For the first month it worked real well. It stabalized me. My only problem with the medication is that i sleep wayyy too much (around 10 hrs a night) I have been overspleeping. ANd when i finally get out of bed, im groggy and kind of down till the afternoon when the fog lifts. A couple of days ago, i ran out and thought id wait a couple of days to get my refill, just to see how id be. Much to my surprise, I FELT BETTER! I had one episode where i felt depressed (more than normal). But i didnt have that zombified feeling i had when i took the medication. My sleep was light and kept waking up throughout the night however. 
 SO my question is, do you think i should stop taking the medication? I will ask my doctor, i just wanted to get some feedback. I am thinking on taking natural sleep aids instead, and maybe switching to another anti-depressant or not taking one at all.
