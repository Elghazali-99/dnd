After moving to an area where I had no one to talk to ,family or friends, and dont drive due to a sleeping disorder.  Being quite ill. My husband refused to help make my adjustment to the area I lived in, yet i tried for 6 years, but finally this november I had a pstchotic breakdown where I thought that I heard God revealing heaven to me and what was going to happen in my life and that if i did certain things,like scream for 10 minutes it would earn me another person moving up a step in heaven.  I was sedated for 24 hrs. with ativan.It was not suicidal or drug induced.  I am in therapy now due to the isolation for 6 years and loneliness ,It was like a prisoner in solitary confinement.  However a month later I suddenly am going thru a divorce as husband will not relocate and now while therapy is helping regain my self esteem,The other night I suddenly felt so frightened as if my brain was running a mile a minute and suddenly felt as if i would lose it again, but after taking 1/2 ativan, it passed.  Its been about 6  weeks since the psychotic episode and i have learned so much about myself in therapy that i am always questioning what went on in breakdown as manytimes before it, i believed that family who have expired speak to me when they need do. And that day all i heard was my sisters talking to me telling me who was going to die.  Now feeling the loneliness of no husband i was wondering if this is natural to have like mini panic attack.  I also was on prometrium a hormone pill and read it can cause psychosis if you had an episode so I just stopped it today.
