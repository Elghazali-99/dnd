I've been getting odd symptoms for years now.  Hot flashes started when I was in my early 30's.
My periods are still regular...although heavier and longer...but still 28 days apart.
 Last year I started to get an arrhythmia. The doctor said not to worry about it.
 About 2 months ago I started getting an ice pick type of pain in my chest...where the breast meets the chest on the left side. 
I have been wracking my brain trying to figure out what it is. It's random and sporadic...not necessarily after eating, yet normally after a cup of coffee in the morning.
It wasn't until today that I made a connection...I got the pain and then a hot flash....followed by cold sweaty hands and feet and then the chills.
My doctor once said that the hot flashes could be peri meno but that I was TOO YOUNG! That was 2 years ago. I'm almost 45 now, and a few months ago he said I could be the right age.
My mom's entire family went through menopause at a much younger age. My mom and one of her sisters was 28 when it happened to them. The rest, including my younger cousins, started menopause in their 30's and done by 40's.
My mom figures that because I had a baby 3 years ago, and lost one last year that this has postponed things.
I'm so confused. I just want to pull my hair out!
 Anyway, just wanted to know if any of you ever had an ice pick in chest feeling followed by hot flashes and or chills.
I don't think it's my heart...figure the doctor would have told me that.
I thought perhaps gallbladder, but wrong side.
Have searched menopause/peri  and all it says is that anything can be a symptom...but the loss of periods is the only true sign.
Any thoughts?
