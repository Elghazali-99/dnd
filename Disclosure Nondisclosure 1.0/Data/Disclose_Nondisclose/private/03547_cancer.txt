In 2013 I was diagnosed with N.E.T. malignant of the illium where small intestine meet large intestine.  They found it during a colonoscopy, when they did the surgery to remove they found one more tumor in the appendix.  The tumor in the intestine was 3 cm and the one the the appendix was 1 cm. The one in the intestine went through the wall so they took lymph nodes 12 found only 11 - 1+ , so they said they needed to keep an eye on me for 2 years.  These are they results of my chromagranin test which don't make sense to me???
 Close to surgery date when I had 2 positive tumors 
 Chromagranin A
  9/13   53.    <93
 2/14.  97.    <93
 4/14.  76.    <93
 7/14.  60.    <93
 7/15.  92.    <93
 With the 7/15 test they found 3 enlarged lymph nodes around the surgery area during the C.A.T. scan but very slightly enlarged like 2 mm enlarged each not enough for him to worry. But he's going to retest in January, he said it might be just an infection around the surgical site.  But he did a full blood work up and my count wasn't up.  
 During the 2 years since the surgery I have had extreme pain in the surgical site and in another site in there they've done all external testing they can but when I suggested a colonoscopy to view the surgical site they said my Oncologist said one was not needed to view tumors.  
I asked my primary care doctor to speak to the gastrointestinal doctor and they refused to do the test. So I went outside the hospital that did my surgery they refused to do the test saying go back to the place you had your previous test done. So how do I know if this is from the surgical site or the lymph nodes since when I actually had to malignant tumor's my levels were within normal range? 
 If you need to know more please ask .  At this point I'm having a very hard time trusting my physician care.
