Last night, I went to the ER. 
I was feeling shaky, weak, racing heart & tingly. 
I had just had a total thyroidectomy on 8/4 and had some calcium issues. 
I thought I was having another low calcium attack. 
The doctor ran some blood work and did an EKG.  He said that his diagnosis was stress and anxiety and gave me an ativan. 
The EKG showed that there were abnormalities, but the doctor said that the abnormalities were normal for me (how would he know that? I hadn't had an ekg done there before) and that it was nothing to worry about. 
Of course I'm freaking out.  Here's what the report says:
