Ive been diagnosed with Major Depression and Generalized Anxietyw/borderline personality traits. Ive told my past 2 therapists that I have BPD. I have a history of abuse as a child, chaotic marriages, falling in and out of love like lightening, lots of anger mostly turned inward but when its outward its near homicidal, bad spending habits, reeeeeaaalllyy intense emotions like my heads gonna come off.. leading to cutting or scratching. History of suicide attempts, love one minute, HATE the next...and noone is listening!! Ive just been released from an intensive outpatient program where they just made sure I didn't off myself. I didn't get to really talk and delve into my issues. I just suffered thru I guess. Whe things got intense and I cut or scratched I was berated for my "bad habits" and told I would be expelled from the program if they continued--well of course they continued, I just stoppped telling the therapist and hid the marks better. Now Im out of the program, searching for a new therapist, trying to get into a DBT therapy program (hard without an "official" BPD diagnosis, harder because I only found one program here in Philly, hardest because they dont take my insurance!) I feel lost out here-- out at sea with no sight of land and all these evil thoughts whirling and whirling in my head with no way out. I feel muzzled, mute unable to talk-- I have a lifetime of pain to verbally disgorge--AND NOONE IS LISTENING!!!  HELP MEEE let me know someone hears me please
