This may sound like a contradiction but I been diagnosed as having ADHD and Schizoaffective Depressive type. The contradiction seems to come from ADHD is a decrease in dopamine and Schizoaffective is an increase in dopamine levels. To resolve this it may have something to do in my case with Acetesomethingorother neurotransmitter. Is their any literature on this topic of studies of people having both ADHD and Schizophrenia? 
 Anyways, I was sick for 3 weeks and off my antidepressant, Depakote and Abilify medication for 2 weeks and all my paranoid symptoms went away. Then I was placed on Geodon, and I have slight paranoia again. In the past I tried to tell a mental health worker it was acute anxiety but they forced the label of paranoia without considering any background information such that my “paranoia” only started after a druggy threatened to kill me. Why I mention this, is if it is just anxiety and the Depression stage was associated with ADHD, then I might not have Schizoaffective disorder after all. In fact perhaps the antipsychotic are making the anxiety and depression associated with ADHD worse. What kind of questions should I be asking my doctor?
