I cannot function any more!  I am so exhausted, tired of all of the acuusations, the sarcasim, the put downs and all the talk about how stupid I am?!  How everything I do is wrong?  I ran from my verbally abusive mother into the arms of a controlling husband?  I only realized this recently as my whole world was crumbling down!  I was faced with too many hurtful realities that I could not face for years.  I lived in denial for years and was trying to please both.  She now lives with me ...and I have tunred into an emotional wreck?!  I can't run away?  No matter what I tell her I am always wrong and she always right?  I am tired...I feel I can't do anything anymore!  I can't move forward as I lost my self esteem and self respect.  I feel powerless to change anything.  I stood up to my husband and was able to stop his control and threatened divorce... he is behaving so far, but what can I do about my mother?  Please help me, I am sinking and losing my self quicker than I can imagine.....Tell me how can I heal myself.  I confront her, but she never stops!  please help.. Is there anything to impower me to make me feel better about my self.  I want to stop her daily dose of verbal abuse.  Please help!
