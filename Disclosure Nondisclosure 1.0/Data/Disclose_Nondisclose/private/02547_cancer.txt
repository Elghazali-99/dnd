Hi All
 I am a 46 year old male, non smoker moderate to heavy drinker at times, slight overweight but not huge.
 Went to my Doctor recently with pains in my sides under my ribs, mostly on left side but also on the right and around the back of ribs. He physically examined me and had a listen but found nothing to concern him, his advice was see what happens and maybe it will settle down. 
 Since then its got a bit better with pain mostly under right ribs, level slightly less but not gone away. Some floating bowel movement and some sinkers. Nothing yellow or white, 50 shades of brown and no more regular or stinky than usual. 
 Also now having some chills but dont feel unwell at all, no nausea or anything like that.  
 have a history of GERD and take omaprazol daily. 
 My mother and my sister both died quite young from cancer (ovarian and bladder) so I am naturally quite paranoid about that. 
 Appreciate comments or view on this, if its slight pancreatitis can that clear up on its own?
