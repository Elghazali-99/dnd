My partner has 3 children to his previous marriage. At the beginning of our relationship he secured 50% shared care with their mother though about two months ago she was approved full day-to-day care though she was open to discuss proposed contact. My partner hasnt proposed any contact with them to date. My partner and I have a 1yr old son. A few days ago he asked me if I wanted to go camping this wknd with his workmates and it seemed like a great idea. The next day he came back and said his mum had arranged to have his 3 children the wknd also and that they're also coming along. At this point I wasn't sure what to do but found it to be ironic and decided not to go. I'm not sure if that was the right thing to do? And in response he said he won't be taking our son as he needs to look after the other 3. I'm suspicious in what's actually happened and am not sure if he's been entirely honest with me about the arrangement for the wknd. Not sure how to handle the situation or what to do? Please help
