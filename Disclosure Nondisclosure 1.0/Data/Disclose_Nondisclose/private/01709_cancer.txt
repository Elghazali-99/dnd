My Grandmother was diagnosed with liver cancer in July, and ultimately passed away in October. The night before her passing, she was overly joyed she was scheduled to be released the next day. I was with her until 8pm that previous night, and she was extremely alert and in great spirits. Everyone was fully aware her case was terminal(chemo was cancelled the week prior), but none of us were giving up....especially her. What has really been bugging me since the moment I watched her take her final breath....is that she was given a flu vaccine(shot), without the consent of herself or any of our family. I questioned the nurse immediately while she administered it, knowing that her immune system was fighting hard enough without the addition of more toxins. I am not naive enough to believe that the hospital is responsible for her death...however I am FULLY convinced that this flu shot completely overwhelmed what little strength her immune system had left. Why would a hospital administer a shot of this nature KNOWING that her time was limited at best? My BIGGER concern is why would they administer this without consulting her family first? This shot was given around dinnertime on October 21st, and her life expired the morning of the 22nd. So I guess to make a short story long...Am I crazy for thinking this, or is it something worth contacting a lawyer about?
