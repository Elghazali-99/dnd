I'm 19 years old. I guess sometime around 16 or 17 I started having mood swings, and soon after that, episodes of sadness or anger for no reason. Small things could set me off, or sometimes I'd just get butterflies in my stomach in the morning, that would lead to very bad days of sadness, not wanting to talk or be around anyone... Me and my girlfriend at 18, broke up right before I graduated. Around the same time, my career I was supposed to start with the marines, fell through and I felt as if I had gotten thrown out of everything in life. I was very depressed and upset at how my life was going. I would tremble, had constant butterflies and my mind and heart eould race. i eventually figured out they were like 24/7 panic attacks/anxiety. My doctor prescribed me to Ativan for anxiety, and we tried different alternatives until we reached Abilify. The combination really worked for me, until I became hooked, and they cut me off cold turkey. After that, I began to cope, and felt good enough to get by, until I've recently felt as if I'm stuck. My conditions have gotten so much worse. I twitch constantly, my mind races to the point that I get headaches, I talk to myself in my head, and ignore people talking to me in reality, I'm always tired because I barely sleep, I have no friends, I stay in the house after work, and don't like to get out and have fun. The only fun I have is work, which is sad. I guess I'm always sad. I feel alone. What is wrong with me? I feel like I'm going insane, and nobody can help me.
