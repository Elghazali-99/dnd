I am a 5 yr bladder cancer survivor.  Was stage III - had radical cystectomy and now have a neo-bladder made from my own intestines.  Was recently having some GI issues.  CT-scan revealed mass in duodenum, and two in the ovary area. after multiple tests, duodenum polyp was found to be benign but it is the type that can become malignant.  MRI revealed this new mass - 3.9cm by 2.4 cm - mixed cystic/solid lesion.  to the right of iliac vessels.  shape is dumbbell with a narrow waist.  In the posterior 1/3 of lesion, there is evidence of enhancement which is delayed.  It is complex in appearance. Margins of enhanced area are irregular and immediate adjacent to the iliac vessels.  
I just received the results from the lab since I had not heard back from the doc that ordered tests.  I sent to my primary care doc and he wants me to go back to my cancer surgery doc from 5 years ago. There are other findings with these results but this one seemed somewhat scary.  Any thoughts on how bad this may be or what would the next course of action be.  Needless to say I'm a bit concerned as was my primary care doc.
