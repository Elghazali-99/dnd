Hi
 3 months ago I was concerned about my depression, I was sleeping all day and unable to function properly. I have had episodes like this before but have never done much about it because within a week or even the next day I would feel way better and sometimes feel extra good. I have always had concerns about my excessive sexuality and alcohol abuse but feel like I get over it and feel good again.
 I read some information on bipolar and related to all the symptoms! I had never been too concerned with my good moods, and usually just blamed alcohol for my outrageous behaviour (like dancing on tables at restaurants) or thinking I was an awesome skateboarder and skating down a steep street.
 When I realised that I may have more than depression I reacted crazy, I began more self harm and having extreme feelings. I also get super angry and irritable.
 When I finally was seen by a therapist I was told it is more likely I have borderline personality and not bipolar as my moods change too often.
 I am able to act 'normal' and good around my friends and public and I have no trouble with my job as an aerobics instructor, however I can never stick with something for very long because i seem to change my mind.
 I have heaps of symptoms that are both bipolar and borderline, is it possible to have both? Do I sound like I have bipolar or borderline? I am freaking out and want to know so I can try to get some control.
 Help me?!!
 (p.s. I have a history of sexual abuse at age 18)
