why stay? Is this a joke? Life is.................................chaotic, depressive, and lonely. I wont tell u my life story bc i feel like its an excuse. I make it what it is. I should have already left. I caught myself crying and calling out for home one day. After, I thought home, does that mean my hometown? I   used to call for my dad and now I was calling for home. And it crossed my mind where is home? where do I belong? I have always felt out of place, like i dont belong here or wasnt the right person. I had been put in the wrong body with the wrong parents, siblings, planet even. How do you deal when you feel like you are miles away from yourself. your soul is drifting away but your body remains. I deal with it by doing the things most hate  and I wait for the end, long for it.Can I reassociate with my body, decend back to it and be a normal happy person? I only wish, but would rather let myself go to the perfect place.............With my light, Father, Love.........GOD. I long to be there and to be whole again.
