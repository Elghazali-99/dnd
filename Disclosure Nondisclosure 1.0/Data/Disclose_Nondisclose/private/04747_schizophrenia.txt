My great grandma told me recently they said she has schizophrenia... I think she might be confusing the term with Parkinson's however with the way she talked about it because she told me over the years about her Parkinson's and how it runs in her side of the family and such and it sounded like she was just describing her Parkinson's.  On the other hand however she kept talking to me about things like how I would come over every morning with my sister and our dog that has been dead for years and she'd feed us which is impossible because I live seven states away and of course the dog is deceased.  I tried telling her it couldn't of possibly happened because I live so far away which took a while to convince her but she didn't argue with me about it.  She also talks about other things like animals running through her place which are highly unlikely of being there.  There was some other stuff like this but my memory doesn't work well when it comes to remembering lists in one sitting.  Now I'm confused due to the ambiguity of the situation.  I should probably tell my psychiatrist if she does have it but I don't want to if she doesn't which I'm not sure right now so I'm not going to bother.  I thought possibly she's developed dementia rather than schizophrenia but I don't know if that causes you to severely hallucinate like that.
