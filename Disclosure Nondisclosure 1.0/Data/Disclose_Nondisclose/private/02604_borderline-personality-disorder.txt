I'm a sophomore in college and im having a lot of relationship problems with my x girlfriend from high school. I never got close or attached to any girls up until a car accident that took my voice for six months. i got attached to this girl and then when it was time to split for college we didnt. The standard events that take place seem to be me overreacting to the standard girl issue  and blowing up (saying some usually really mean things)  usually with the intent at the time to have that be the last argument will have, but then i always calm down and  want to fix things. I feel like i have the standard depression symptoms not every day but a lot.  i feel like thats the tip of the ice burg. I was diagnosed with depression in high school before my car accident. My dad's a hoarder and i know my mom's had her fair share of pills prescribed to her so i feel like im genetically vulnerable. I've also considered the fact that maybe i just have a tempor and am depressed but i really dont want to stop drinking for four months again and this time during college.
