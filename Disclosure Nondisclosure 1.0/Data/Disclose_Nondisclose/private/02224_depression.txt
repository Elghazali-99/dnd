Hello, my question is whether anyone else has these kinds of 'episodes' of sudden dips in mood.
 All my life I've had these episodes were I just feel so frustrated/depressed/bored to the point where I just cry and scream. I haven't seemed to work out a trigger but it's so embarrassing and awful, it's like a panic attack in the way that it just starts up and I can't seem to stop it, I'll be unresponsive to anyone who talks to me and just completely go back to as if I was a baby almost? I'm aware of what's happening but it's like I can't break out of it, I don't know. Eventually it stops, as a kid my parents would do down thing to distract me and these days I turn the tv on. 
I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety this time last year, for a while I was following my mood swings to see i had bipolar but it never really came to anything, they still put me on antipsychotics though which turned me into a total zombie. I've been on various antidepressants and am currently not on anything. Sorry if this isn't very clear!
