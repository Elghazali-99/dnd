i hafta leave this house TODAY. Im eighteen and my parents are awful. They think that bc my room gets messy it gives them a right to be hateful. A normal parent may get frustrated but my father allows my stepmom to call me profane names, then calls the family and tells them i deserve it. Ive told him over nd over i was raped by a cousin and he still allows him at the house and both parents laugh nd tlk to him as if hes great..im an artist and they write in sharpie on my artwork. They throw out clothes i buy with my money. They call me slutty, make fun of how i look, say im disgusting..spew off that im mentally cracked and the first thing they tell ppl is im bipolar or schitzophrenic when i have neither. My dads family, which is huge, have done a lot of physical abuse in the past, but no one sees my side bc my dad nd stepmom paint a horrible picture. My own sisters insult me. Last night was awful bc my friends mom hadda infection so awful that she wud die if it wasnt fixed. No one wud take her to the hospital
