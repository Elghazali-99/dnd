My fiance and I have been together for more than 6 years. Since the day we informed his parents about our plans to get married, they have been giving me the cold shoulder. They have raised several issues with my parents and have not said one positive word about me. It has been 1.5 years since we told them and they have been delaying the marriage ever since for some reason, like his dad is having some surgery, they were shifting to another city, his grandmom is ill etc. etc. Now I dont understand what to do. My fiance supports me and loves me to death but I dont know why his family cant come terms to the situation. They have agreed for the marriage in part but they dont seem to do anything about it. My fiance doesnt want to get married without them being around, which i understand. But how long is a person supposed to wait? While we are waiting, why cant they try to get to know their future daughter in law? I've become very bitter about the whole thing and have slowly started hating his family. My negative attitude is affecting our relationship, which was perfect for 5 yrs until we told his parents about our marriage plans.
