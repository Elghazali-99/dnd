Hi, I don't want this to sound like just another post of hypochondriac, but I think I may have BPD.
 If I could have one day of complete happyness It would be amazing. My moods change like the wind and for no apparent reason. Ill be having a good day with my bf and hell say something, that anyone else would just laugh at like a joke but ill freak out, yelling screaming feeling like i could kill him and i want to, then hell get mad at me for yelling, and ill start crying and sobbing, thinking im just nothing. that I should kill myself and no one wants me, im horrible at everything. Then once i calm down im fine again. Laughing and telling him I love him. he's still mad that i freaked out but i cant see why hes still mad, and i cry and get all sad again because i think he's going to leave me and i apologize. Its not only with him, thats just my best example.
 Ive been diagnosed with PMDD, PTSD -twice from two seperate events one when i was 6 and one from when i was 16. I have an inherited anxiety disorder and ADD I started going to a psychologist when I was 5 because of an intense fear of dogs and anxiety, and more or less i never stopped. I'm 20 and i just stopped going about a year and a half ago. Ive never been diagnosed with anything probably because I never told any of them what I really am thinking. The last time I did I was send to a mental hospital. (I was sent for hurting myself )
 Friends tell me they think I have Bipolar but I wish that I could have a solid mood for a day nevertheless a week or a month.
I dont want this to seem like a cry for attention, I'm actually curious but I dont feel safe asking my parents or talking to a psychologist. I dont trust that they wont try to send me away like the last time i was honest. 
If you have any questions I would be happy to answer them. I just want to find out an answer to why I am the way I am.
