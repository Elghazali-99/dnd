Seven years ago I lost my virginity when I was raped by a friend at a house party. I had told him no and couldn't get away. I didn't say anything at the time as I blamed myself for being too drunk. A few months later he was arrested for drugging and raping another girl. Since then I've no self esteem, I attract people who use me and cheat. I push people away and have anxiety around men. I drink heavy. I've never had sex sober. I'm scared of letting anyone get close. Recently I've pushed away someone I was genuinely interested as I panicked he was getting too close, he's moved on to someone else and I'm devastated. I'm in therapy for depression and anxiety, they have referred me on to a specialised rape counselling. This has brought up all the feelings I pushed down, I'm having anxiety and can barely leave the house. I can't face the world. I'm trembling and twitching, my body aches, I've no concentration, my mood is low. I've lost weight and I'm terrified of going to this counselling.
