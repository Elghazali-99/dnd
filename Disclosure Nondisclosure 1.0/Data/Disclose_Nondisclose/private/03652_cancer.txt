Okay I am 16 years old and I think I have colon cancer. For the past two months, I've been constipated, severely. I only go to the bathroom every week or so, with very small exceptions. The first stool of the week will always have mucus all over it, the next ones having a little bit of mucus. I am bloated most of the day also. Yesterday, I experienced blood in the stool but I am fairly sure this was from an anal fissure(Ive had them before), as the stool was sharp and painful. Whenever I do go, the stools are always hard balls, not always clumped together. I kinda have abdominal pain, but it only lasts a second and it barely hurts at all. My diet is bad, and I am just terrified that I have colon cancer at this young age because I've never eaten well my whole life. I will be going to the doctor in a few days, but for now, what can you tell me? Does this mean colon cancer? Some days I'll go two days in a row, like I used to. But that isn't usually the case. I know I might be freaking out too much, but I don't want to die before I even get to do anything i've wanted to with my life, please help. Is there anything else this could be? Or am I just paranoid
