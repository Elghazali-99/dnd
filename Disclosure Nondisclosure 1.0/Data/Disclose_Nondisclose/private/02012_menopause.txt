Hi Everyone.  How are you?  I'm new to this board and am hoping that you ladies can help me.  I am thinking about trying macafem supplements and wondered if you have tried them and if you got an results?  How long did it take to start working?  I'm at the end of my rope and need to get some help fast!  I'm currently 42 years old and started into menopause around the age of 38.  I'm not sure if I have "normal" meno symptoms or not but I have been tested and that's what it is.  I am freezing cold all thur the day [yes I have had thyroid tested its normal] and than at night I'm so hot I can't sleep!  I have gained 60 pounds over the last year and a half [thinking it's due to lack of sleep as well as chocolate cravings that are unbearable!]  I have no sex drive at all, in fact I got married a year and a half ago and we have had sex once - that is not like me at all - before meno I had a high sex drive!  But the biggest issue for me with meno is the tiredness I have.  I am just so tired I can't do anything!  And I mean nothing - I lost my job about 6 months ago because I just couldn't do the job due to being so tired!  I have been to tons of doctors and they all say it will get better when you get peri - I can't wait that long!  I looked into going with BHRT but the cost for the first visit with labs would be about 1000.00 and not covered by my insurance!  I just don't know what to do anymore.  I read some great things about macafem and am thinking about trying it but before I order it at about 30.00 I would like others thoughts.  Any ideas or info you can give me would be great.  Thanks and have a great day  ~  Wellness_Seeker
