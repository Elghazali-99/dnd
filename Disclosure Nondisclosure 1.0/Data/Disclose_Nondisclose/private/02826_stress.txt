Hi,  I am 22 and I have been noticing that I have strong bouts of confusion, memory loss, dizziness and weak mental perception.  Confusion in that I have begun to remember things that did not historically happen.  It could be something as simple as getting information together at work and it not actually happening at all.  But, of course, I have the recollection of it, the steps I took to get the task done, and the proof that it never happened.  Memory loss in that someone could ask me a question and I’ll have no memory of it the next moment.   Dizziness in that sometimes I feel as if the world is spinning, but I’m sitting still and my vision is stable.  Mental perception in that when I drive at night, shadows, to me, appear to be anything from a blockade to a person.  In fact, if it is raining, and I am going down a small dip in the road, most likely I will think the slick surface is some type of blockage in my way.  If I can perceive clouds to be mountains in Ohio, something must be seriously wrong.    What could possibly be conditions that cause such strange effects?
