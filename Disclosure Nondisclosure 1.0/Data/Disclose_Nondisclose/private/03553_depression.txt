I've been severely depressed for a few years now. I feel alone in my own house. My parents don't understand and even though I have a younger sister she won't understand. I haven't been this sure of wanting to commit suicide since late in June. I was writing goodbye notes to my parents and my sister. Then one day my parents had some weird intervention type thing for me and all they did was yell at me. My dad called me weak and my mom said I need to grow a pair, etc. it was just them hanging up on me and i was defensive the whole time. It even made my anger worse, so their little conversation didn't help anything. My dad is retired military so he say I'm just weak minded and don't know how to cope with anything. All this really hurt because they're supposed to be helping me not making me feel worse. I just feel so angry and sad all the time. I can go days without hardly talking to anyone and my parents get angry at me. They even made fun of the whole suicide thing before. My dad said "what? Are you gonna kill yourself?" Then he started laughing like it's just nothing. I wanted to say yes because that's what I really want to do but I just said no. I know I'm not a weak person, but I just can't deal with this anymore. I feel weird talkin to my parents because they don't know how to communicate. They make everything awkward. They don't talk to me about anything. I'm 17 years old and my dad still turns the volume down on radio station commercials that talk about make enhancement pills. I'm by no means too young to hear that. He just feels awkward about that and so does my mom. It pisses me off. I have to find everything out from the internet and from people in the streets and tv etc. They can't even communicate with each other so it's pointless. I'm alone. No family to listen. No friends that actually give a crap.  I'm alone in a house full of people and I'm scared I'm really going to hurt myself for real this time.
