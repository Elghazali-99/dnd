Hello.  I am a 34 year old male with no history of cancer in my family.  I consider myself in good overall health except for maybe a suboptimal diet, and have no known diseases.  I am worried about this soft lump on the right side of my neck that I found two days ago.  From my estimation it is almost an inch in diameter, I can move it freely under the skin, and so far I don't feel any pain unless I squeeze it really hard.  My main worry is that from what I can tell, it is in a similar location as a supraclavicular lymph node, which I've read has a high chance of cancer if swollen on the right side.  I have attached a picture of my neck area (not graphic, just a smartphone picture) that shows with a couple of dots from a permanent marker where the lump is.  I've already gone to my doctor and she palpated the area and said it's not the supraclavicular node, and that it does not feel hard enough to qualify as a tumor.  I also had a set of chest x-rays done and the doctor went over the results with me to further say that she did not see anything that looks like a tumor (tumor would show up as white on chest x-ray right?).  I had blood drawn as well at a lab near the doctor's office for a CBC, but since my provider will be closed this friday I worry that I will not hear about the results until next week, setting me up for a ton of anxiety.
 Anyway, my questions are as follows:
 1) based on my description of the growth, and what my doctor said, does it seem like it's cancer?
2) I know that you guys don't always like to look at pictures, but since I have already gone to a doctor, would you kindly please look at my photo to see if the area I marked is actually the location of a supraclavicular node?  My doctor tells me my lump is not in the location of that node because it's too high compared to the clavicle bone but a second opinion would really help.
3) If a lymph node was swollen in the case of a tumor, it would show up on the chest x-ray right?
  Thank you so much!
