Hi my boyfriend has been diagnosed with bpd, upd, psychotic trates,hallucinations,and is known to be a very violent 20 year old man. He should take 60mg flluxotine a day, 6mg rispiridone a day, 20mg diazepam a day and 20mg buspirone a day. He hasn't took his medication in 8 weeks because he thinks doctors are trying to stop him living in the real world " his world" the shadow realm. He has a bag he always has on him and the other night I went in it when he was in the bath there is bottles of water I think with crossed drawn on them, wooden stakes, syringes that say essence of garlic on, the blades of kitchen knives stook on wood,  and it sounds silly I know but they look extremely professional like alot of time was spent on them. He will only go out if it is dark. Hs legs shake if it's light and the curtains aren't closed,  if he hears a bang or knocking or shouting he will get a knife and sit there behind the door like he is waiting for somebody to gain entry. When I look in his eyes it is like everyday I am losing him. He has cold eyes like there is a storm in them. He throws salt on the floor near the doors and keeps drawing pictures of strange things like vampires?  And keeps writing letters to a man called Victor saying he has the target confirmed and they don't make sense. He wants to die alot and shakes like a child and can't breath and I hold him until he calms down. He has crown court on Thursday for first appearance for supply of class C drugs it isn't the crime of the centry as he only sold two boxes of pain killers. And has pleaded guilty. He will not go hospital as this time last year he went several times and was sent to a hospital for 3-4 days voluntary. I don't think people realize how bad this is and I'm not having it all on my shoes if he killed somebody. I have googled everything and don't know what to do. He also punches out in his sleep and screams and it's so vivid it isn't jibberish. It's like he's awake. Thankyou.
