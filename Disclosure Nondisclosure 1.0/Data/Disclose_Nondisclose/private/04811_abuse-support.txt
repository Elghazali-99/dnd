I'm a 17 year old female. My godfather is 38 years old. Ever since I was a freshman in highschool he takes me out to the movies or out to eat. His wife doesn't know. He wants to keep it a secret from her so he makes me do it too. When we go out to the movies he drops me off at home at like 2am. He let's me drink in front of him but no one else. He has drank with me too. He got me drunk and I'm pretty sure he touched me. He likes to lay right next to me and put his arm around me. He likes to pull me over and sit on his lap and won't let me go when I try to pull away. He gives me full body massages and it makes me uncomfortable. He lies to his wife and my mom and makes me lie too about him spending time with me. He even had me spend the night with him when his wife wasn't home. My godfather loves to take me shopping and by me clothes except he only buys me things he thinks I look sexy in. He buys them so when I wear them it pleasures him. He buys me yoga pants, bras and thongs. Sometimes he asks me to model the thongs he baught me. He wants to see what I look like in them. He is always calling and texting me and never stops. He gets mad when I don't answer him. He really touchy with me. And he sends me pictures of nude people. He also says things to me like you look delicious, or you look sexy and hot. He tells me he has dreams about me and he tells me his sex life he has with his wife. He told me if he wasn't married he would b with me. He knows I've been sexually abused and raped before so I don't know why he acts this way with me. Is he being inappropriate with me? Is this abuse? Someone help me so I can go help myself by turning him in or saying something about it. I need to know what you think about this because I don't want to tell someone about this if it's normal or whatever.
