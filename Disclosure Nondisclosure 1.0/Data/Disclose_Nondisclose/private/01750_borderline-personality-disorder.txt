A bit about me first, I'm a 21 year old female in the north east of England. I've been suffering from some for of depression since the age of about 8. I'm a self harmer, recovering atm but still do it minor.
 About 4 months or so ago my doctor made the tentative diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder however as the weeks have gone on and I've moved away resulting in another doctor I'm begining to think that this diagnosis could be wrong. I'm thinking this because my moods don't seem to last long enough to be BP and I have more attacks of anger and anxiety more so than 'manic' episodes. Also these attacks only seem to last minutes rather than days/weeks and so on. So I've been doing a bit of reading and I'm starting to think that BPD fits better than BP. I have a tendancy to have extremes of emotions within minutes of each other and also I have quite an shakey realtionship with spending money impulsively (sp?) and of course that horrbile little demon called self harm.
 I've been having these bouts of surging emotions since I was around 12, but they have been steadily getting worse. I'm not looking for a diagnosis here just some adivce. I'm seeing my new GP this coming monday and I'm hoping I'll have the courage to bring this topic up at the time.
 Any comments would be greatly appreciated.
