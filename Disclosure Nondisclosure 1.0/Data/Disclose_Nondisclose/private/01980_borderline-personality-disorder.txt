Can anyone relate to my problem. People think and say I'm crazy because I tell them what I have in mind. I say things that are wierd to them. Yesterday, a guy brought in a water resistant laptop from Negro Ponte program, I told him I would like one so that I can take it in the hot tub when I take a bath. He says its not waterproof, I say I'll wrap it in a plastic bag and that would protect it from the water. A lady who sat next to me said I'm crazy to want to take a lap top in the hot tub. She says hot tubs are for relaxing but for me I love the internet and I feel browsing the internet while I relax in the tub would be a good idea. But everyone in the room thinks I'm crazy, they laugh and tease me. I worry a lot of what people think of me because it seems that I have all these crazy ideas that people would never think of.  As  a result I avoid going to gathering where there are many people, and even if I go I try to not say much fearing that I would say something wierd and people would not only think I'm crazy but say right on my face that I'm crazy. I have been called 'crazy' so many times and it really bothers me. Please help if you can relate to my story.
