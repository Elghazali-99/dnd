My father killed himself years ago and I was half way around the world away from home and never blamed myself but now I just broke up with my wife and I just don't want to go on anymore. I worry that my adult daughter might blame herself for my choice. She know that my wife was cheating and there is no chance of fixing the marriage and I have filed for divorce based on adultery. We have been apart for a couple of months but I see myself going downhill fast. I have not been to work for the last two weeks and now I don't want to go outside because I don't want to tell another person why my wife is not with me. I did talk to a shrink last week but only felt worse after I left the office. My daughter lives in another state and it's just not doable to live closer but she wants me to move close to or even in with her. I am afraid if I follow my dad and I stop my pain what does it do to her. She does not know how my father died as I always told her it was an accident but if I can't stage the perfect accident she will know that my death was not an accident. She calls me every day and sometimes two or three times a day. I think she suspects I am tired with life and I want to quit. Funny part is I miss my wife so much and going to bed without talking or touching is the worst time of the day
