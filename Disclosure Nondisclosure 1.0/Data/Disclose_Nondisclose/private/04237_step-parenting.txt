HI everyone......
I have a 5 year old step daughter, me and my husband have been married almost 4 years. 
Brianna comes and stays with Us 2 weeks out of the month for 7 days and then goes back with her mom for the same amount of time, joint custody, these has been going on for about 1 year. 
 My problems is when ever something comes up about brianna, my husband doesnt want to say anything to her mom, he doesnt want to make her mad, he tells me the he wants to stay on her good side all the time. Which upsets me sometimes becauses he is quick to go off on me about bri and say that he is going to leave me, because of some topics that have came up about her mom and bri.
 I also have a big problem with bri because she will not listen to me, she feebies all the time, she gives me dirty looks all the time, hits on my 1 year old, and just disrespects me all around. I am a stay at home mom so I take care of her more then either one of her parents do. I have talked to my husband about it but all he says to bri is if you dont stop he will bust her butt. But she is still doing it and it is alot worst when my husband isnt around. He tells me to put her in time out but the poor child when be in time out 24/7.
 Also my husband doesnt do anything with her. I have to make him get her in the shower. He thinks sitting her in front of the tv with junk food is being a good father to her. My husband doesnt really have anything to do with my oldest son but wants me to do everything for his daughter and i am having a hard time doing that. And the youngest kid which is me and my husbands, he doesnt do much with him either. I had to b.... at him to get him to get the baby in the bath tub, dominick is 1.
 There is so much more going on but I guess I will just start here.
PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
