Three years ago I stayed at a hotel, and I believed that I had a horrible anxiety attack but a few friends have told me they don't think it was anxiety? I heard voices outside my room and went to check cause they were extremely loudx though I couldn't understand them, but no one was ever there. I started getting anxious and I'd made a habit of hiding in bathrooms until my anxiousness subsided, only, when I did, I'd heard the voices outside the bathroom door instead. I panicked, and admitablly, dramtically decided to sit in the tub which was farthest from the door. I'd felt life something was touching and grabbing at me, and began to twitch to the point where I HAD to move my arms amd legs, I couldn't keep still. 
Two years later I tried sleeping in my room one night, and I normally keep my tv on. I was about to fall asleep when I started to hear mixed up whispers. Assuming it was the tv glitching out, I exited the channel and put it on sleep mode. This continued to happen, and I slept a total of maybe 30 minutes that night. Ever since then I've heard weird voices on and off, right next to my ears when I try to sleep. Only some of what I hear is understandable. There have been a few occasions where I had to black out due to them screaming, which was incredibly loud considering how close they sounded. Two of my friends who suffer from Schizophrenia suggested I get tested for it. Should I? Am I just over-dramatizing everything and this is my way of subconciously wanting attention?
