OK so I'm 19 and I just kinda googled daydreaming because this is what I do..ALOT.. Any way, so I googled daydreaming and came across this article that was about Maladaptive Daydreaming. I could relate to everything that was stated in the article one way or another. The thing is with my daydreaming, it's found it's way into reality. Here's what I mean by that. Ok so Maladaptive Daydreaming is when someone daydreams excessively about different scenarios etc, to the point where they've dreamed the day away. With me, I do do that but I speak out loud. And the people in my scenario's are real people I have encountered- not made up characters. I conversate with them as if they're really there. It could range from one person to an entire group of say 20+ people. I also hold microphone sized objects to my mouth when no one watching everytime I play my radio. It's like I have to do it. I pretend I'm a singer or something. I can spends hours evryday doing this. But to make myself feel like the ideal person, I control what happens in every scenario. I know they aren't there with me, because everytime I do this, i make sure no one is around. I can't seem to stop though. It almost feels like an escape from my busy 'real' world. My question is this, Is this a disorder and if so, what is it? It's like I have no control. My brain goes in and out of these daydreams all day. But I must say, because of this, I am really creative i writing and art.
