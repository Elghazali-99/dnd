Im 16 and i beleive i suffer from severe depression. I was a minor anerixic a few years ago, and im underweight now- yay. But for the past 3 years i havent been able to cry, even when im really sad and i try to cry th tears wont come out- i always feel emotionaly disconnected. I lose intrest in everything i do, school, gfs, etc. And my sleeping patterns messed up, i sleep everyday i get home from school cause im so tired and i wake up around 8 - then stay up to 1 or 2, i get up for school at 5:30. When im at school i cover my face with my hair to hide myself from others, its more like an adiction now and i dont think i could ever move it to make my face visable. I also seek pleasure by overly masterbating, i understand that its normal for my age but i sometimes do it around 5 times a day even if im not sexual aroused. I refuse to see a doctor. Altough i never had suicidal tendences i still am worries that i might get worse. Please help, im just a kid and i dont want this.
