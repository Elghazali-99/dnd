Ok here is my issue. A few months ago my daughter and I moved in with my boyfriend and his 10 year old daughter. His daughters mother hasn't been a part of her life since she was 2. Before We moved in together my daughter would make comments about my boyfriend and his daughter acting as if they were dating. Other people in my family brought their behaviors to my attention as well. I wrote it off as people are raised differently and thought nothing of it. Well now We live together and I see what everyone was talking about. He is very defensive over her. Not protective but defensive. He goes in the bathroom with her when she takes a shower. 
They constantly touch each other. Patting and slightly rubbing her butt. She puts her hands up his shirt to rub his chest. Very kissy. She sits on his lap in underwear and rubs her nose along his neck and kisses on his neck. If he kisses me or flirts with me he immediately does the same to her. He climbs in the bed with her in his underwear...knowing that's all she has on herself. If he pushes her away she gets infuriated...to the point of she put feces on my clothes. I could keep going for hours. She's more developed than most 10 year olds and she masturbates frequently. I'm really concerned. Can someone help?
