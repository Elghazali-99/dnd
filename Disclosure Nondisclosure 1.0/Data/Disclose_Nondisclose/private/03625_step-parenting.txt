I need someplace to discuss my strong dislike to being called Nonna or any other Grandmotherly term at 42, and my husbands adamancy to me having a Grandma like title. Our situation is special. My daughters 14 and 11 only in middle school, leave me still feeling fairly young and I am unable to relate to that next stage in life yet. His boys are 27 and 24. They are from two different mothers the youngest was from a previous marriage and our relationship is what I think is appropriate, he includes me but has his mom and does not expect too much.  His oldest son has had a difficult life and had lived with us before reuniting with his mom at around 14, and leaving the state to live with her til he graduated. Our relationship has always been strained  (he was 11 when I met him)very needy and wanted me to be momma but I was feeling more mentor than momma, and a bit suffocated. I supported and looked out for him but it hasn't changed. Now my husband and my stepson strongly want me to fill grandma shoes and I feel it is impeding any opportunity to have a relationship with the toddler because I didnt feel like Momma and I dont feel like Grandma now. Help!!!! I can only compare it to when your young and you love your siblings but they fall asleep on you and you want to scream and shove them off. How do I find a happy medium?
