My husband and I of 4 years this Nov. have been going back and forth with the divorce discussion since year 1.  Never mind about the whys and hows... we are both in agreement that we just aren't working out and we have become different people since the previous 2yrs of dating and living with each other before marriage.
 We have no children and just sold our home.  He is military and I have been diagnosed with MS in 2009.  We will be transferring out of our current state of residence in 6 months.  We are civil, but miserable.  We are completely clueless as to how this will go down and we plan to eventually obtain the services of a lawyer once we move.
 I'm here today to try to gather some insider knowledge beforehand on what to expect from the court and a lawyer.  Neither of us have a lot of money to spend.  I don't want any part of his pension or any nominal support because I just don't think that's fair or right of me to take from him just because of my "womanly right" and blah blah blah.
 The plan is for us to transfer and for me to get a job, obtain my own insurance then, start the process.  My questions are this:
 We were married in VA, but will not be living in VA when we move in 6 months.  Will that cause additional legal issues or complications?   Extra hoops?
 Do we have to be separated before filing divorce?  and how long of a process will this all take?
 Finally, when we go to court will the judge not consider that I am not asking for any monetary support and being that I have MS, but no disabilities, award marital support anyway?  This one is my biggest concern and am wondering if we should go about this outside of court if this is the case.
 Thank you for listening and any feedback you can offer.
