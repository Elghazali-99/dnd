Hello,
 I have a friend who came to visit me recently, and is still here. At the moment, he is refusing medical assistance. He appears to be a  male, 16-25 age range, caucasian. No known family illnesses or allergies.
 This seems to occur during the early hours of the morning, especially when he is laying down horizontally. Initially, he began to shiver and then hyperventilate. I assisted in calming his breathing down and allowing a steady flow of oxygen to his body. 
 Today the tremors began to occur again, uncontrollable of course, to a certain degree. He complained of feeling light-headed and dizzy. He also complained that bright lights was hurting his eyes. He does not feel cold nor does he has a fever. He had also noted that he had difficulty maintaining control of his arms: tingling sensation and numbness. 
  My assessment is that the tremors are caused by lack of sleep, increased levels of stress and a less than desirable diet.
 He has not been sleeping well, pattern is irregular. 
 What do you think?
