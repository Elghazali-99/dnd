I am on thyroid medication and cortisol.  i am 49 1/2 years old. I have no uterus--but i have both ovaries.  I take promethreum 8 days a month--supposed to be days 18 to 25--but it is a little hard for me to judge since i don't have a period to go by.  i take it when my breasts starte to get tender---which happens on a fairly regular basis---so i know i still have some sort of cycle.
 I am dealing with such horrible depression and anxiety there are days that i just want to cease to exist. I do not have any idea how to tell the difference between peri-menopaus symptoms, menopaus symptoms, thyroid symptoms or cortisol symptoms.   i have not been able to get my sex hormones tested because the doc says they need to be tested during a certain time during your cycle to be right---but i can't figure out when that time is without a period to go by.    
 I would be willing to have my sex hormones tested every week for 4-6 weeks if it would halp to give some kind of idea of what my body is doing---I have really good insurance coverage for blood work.
 My testosterone was low in the past and i was put on a testosterone cream.  My DHEA was also low and i used to take 25 mgs.  My new doc told me that was a mans' dose and told me to take 10 mgs---then he did blood work and my DHEA was only about 10--he said it should be around 280---so he had me up the DHEA to 20 mgs.  i know it is a precursor to estrogen and testosterone.
 If anyone could shed some light on things and educate me a little more on endocrine issues and sex hormone imbalances I would greatly appreciate it!
