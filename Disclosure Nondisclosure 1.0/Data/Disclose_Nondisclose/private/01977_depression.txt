Hi I am a 14 yr old who has been suffering from major depression for two years.. I have been out of my residential treatment center for a little over a year now. In October I got in trouble for having sex with a senior... He was 17... He made me feel amazing and loved. I can't stop thinking about him and I see him in the halls all the time.. I swear he looks at me like he misses me! I love him but I can't tell him because my mom called the cops and they told him not to talk to me... My mom tried to say it was date rape but no believes me when I say I wanted too... I'm afraid of my mom... An I have no one to tell this because I severe trust issues.... I miss him and I swear he misses me too.. He is all I think about all day everyday.. Not being able to have anything to do with him anymore and thinking about and missing him so much is killing me.... I don't wanna get up in the morning I only wanna sleep and when I'm up I think about cutting and burning myself again....!how do you fix something like this? My life isn't worth this... I just want it to end but at the same time a close friend committed suicide a few months ago and it hurt everybody.... How do I prevent that when I really don't care about anything anymore.... What do I do about all this? :(
