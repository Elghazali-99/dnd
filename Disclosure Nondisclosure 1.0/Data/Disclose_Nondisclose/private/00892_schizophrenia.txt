I don't know if anyone can help me.  My son was diagnosed with schizophrenia a year and a half ago but a few months before he was diagnosed he told me that he was transgender.   This surprised me because I remembered that at the age of 13 or  14 he was looking longingly at his sisters girl friend who had come to visit for a few days.  In his senior year he briefly dated a girl for about a month and told me she was his girlfriend.  He seemed very excited about having a girlfriend but it ended for some reason.  He never told me any of the details and I didn't ask.  About four months after that he was diagnosed with sz.
 I have read that there is some connection between sz and feeling transgender but there isn't a lot of information linking the two.  Nothing definite.  In the mean time he is in support groups for transgenders under the encouragement of his psychologist who doesn't have a lot of experience with sz.   
 My husband and I would like him to go to a different psychologist, one who has experience with sz.  Someone who knows more than the Dr he sees now.  It's hard though because he likes his current dr. and we don't want to alienate my son in any way. He is a wonderful person.
 We will support our son if he truly is transgender but something tells me that it is related to the schizophrenia.
 Can anyone chime in on this?  Thank you all so much.
