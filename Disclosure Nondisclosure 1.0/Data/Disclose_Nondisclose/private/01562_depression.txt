Hi I wonder if anyone can help. I am 35 years old and have been on and off medication since I was 20 years old ( mainly down to me thinking I'm better and coming of med) I have been back on medication now for 2 years with a few changes to try and find something that suits me as I also suffer with pain attacks. The medication I currently take is cymbalta 60mg daily, how ever after being on it for 6 months now I don't feel any better. I seem to have days where I can stop cleaning, washing and thing just to keep me busy and am very happy, then for no reason I will just wish I was dead, feel useless, everyone better off without me, hate myself, want to sleep but still feel tried I flip out over the smallest thing and just can't cope, then be fine again. Ended up at the hospital on Monday night husband didn't know what to do with me, crying and shaking uncontrollable and had 2 massive panic attacks. Hospital just seemed like they couldn't be bother. Have I diagnosed correctly as this feels like more then just depression and am desperate to get the right help and not feel like this anymore. Any help would be gratefully received .
