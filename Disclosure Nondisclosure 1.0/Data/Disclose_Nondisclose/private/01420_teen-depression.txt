I am a seventeen year old girl, and I constantly fantasize about anything. Not necessarily all the time, but often. I have sexual thoughts most of the time, and they're not always about sex, but kissing and showing affection. I always fantasize about being with a guy, being in love. Sometimes I fantasize about happy, fabricated moments that are not likely to happen, yet in my mind I pretend they either are going to happen or have happened, but I know they did not or will not happen, however I still dwell and entertain the thoughts and fantasies. I fantasize when I listen to music, and imagine living a life I want. I'm always fantasizing. I tend to gain self-esteem from this, it makes me feel good about myself and I guess it's what my life is driven by. Is this normal as a teen? Will I get over having habitual sexual thoughts one day? I really am concerned because I know one day, I won't be able to think the way I do anymore and I'm afraid I will want to, but I won't be able to because I won't be young anymore.
