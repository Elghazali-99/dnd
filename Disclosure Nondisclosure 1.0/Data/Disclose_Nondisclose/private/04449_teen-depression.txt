ok..im 14 and a girl. I know I'm depressed but I cant bear to even think about telling anyone. I dont really have a best friend even though i have a bunch of friends. I cry almost every day when I get home for no apparent reason. I mean I cry because when I'm left alone(which is alot) I tend to think about death, and how f-ed up the world is and how I feel like we all constantly judge eachother and how depressing the world really is and its kind of a downward spiral from there..Me and my family have had issues ever since 2 years ago when my mom had a stroke. She's disabled now. She can walk and do stuff but things are difficult for her. About 2 weeks ago she tried to kill herself because her and my dad have been having issues. I can barely speak to her. I can barely look at her. I'm so incredibly pissed and I dont want to be. I didnt need her **** to deal with on top of everything else....I drink occasionally..only enough to get a slight buzz and to take my mind off of my problems which i know is really bad..I go to sleep usually around 3 and I have to wake up at 5 for school...All i ever really do is surf the internet and listen to semi depressing music that I can relate to. I really need a way to fix myself without telling my parents or my doctor. I dont want my family to show sympathy towards me. Sorry this is kind of all over the place but can you help please?
