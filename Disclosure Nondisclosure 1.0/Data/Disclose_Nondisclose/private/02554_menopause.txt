I have questions and appreciate a place to voice them. I had a D&C, Hysteroscopy, and Endometrial Ablation in Feb., 2015 after several years of abnormal bleeding and the following protocol. The procedure was a breeze. No pain to speak of and no bleeding since that time almost 6 months ago. I thought it was successful. Only think I'll add is that pathology at the procedure revealed no concerns of cancer. However, at the post op exam the PA stated that it was a good thing I had the EA since they found precancerous cells. Not sure but they may have sent in additional slides for review.
 Fast forward to present, I went in 3 weeks ago for my yearly exam and along with PAP they did a blood test to measure hormone levels. The blood test revealed that Estradial was "much higher than expected." They called me in for an Ultrasound which revealed that the endometrial lining had thickened to 18mm from 4.5mm the last time I had an Ultrasound which was 3 months before the EA. Again that's unexpected so they called me in for an Endometrial Biopsy. They weren't able to do a biopsy because the cervix was blocked so I'm scheduled for another D&C in 3 weeks.
 I'm somewhat anxious about this. I'm 59 and menopausal for 10+ years. Anything you could tell me to fill in the blanks would be appreciated.
