I just had a major surgery three months ago and my mom has helped me out, but sometimes she makes it seem like a burden to help me.  I just do not know what to do.  It seems as though we constantly fight either how I am taking care of my kids or my house.  She will just step in when I am disciplining and wonder why I get mad.  She likes to baby the kids more.  She has helped me out a lot, but I feel like I am a kid again.  I have another surgery in a week and a half, so I am going to have to go down again.  I will have to do all this again the not taking care of my kids I can not pick my youngest up since after the first surgery.  I am so tired of depending on people.  This morning she yelled at me about how she had to catch up with her work cause I am going down.  She did not say it like that she said.  I AM BEHIND CAUSE I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR KIDS!!!!!  I so want this to be over and for me to be in control of my life again.  I guess i am just venting and hoping for words of wisdom.  I am stressed over the surgery last time I almost died I really do not want another one.  I am stressed about that and of course money and I really do not want to get yelled at 8:00 in the morning.
