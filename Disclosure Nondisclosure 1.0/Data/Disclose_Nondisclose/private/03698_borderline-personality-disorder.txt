Hi - I recently left a therapist I had been working with for two years because we had reached a point in our therapy where he had done all he could, and I needed to see someone new who would be able to pick up where he and I left off.  Well, I started seeing someone new, and she is fine.  The problem is, I am obsessed with my previous therapist.  I miss him so much and I find myself driving by his house (that is where his office is) and calling him just to hear him say hello (I block the number so he doesn't know its me.)  Not in a stalkist way.  I know that if he notices he would not do anything, but I also know that this is a problem.  My current therapist and I are working together on my missing him and the relationship I had with him, right or wrong.  But I feel so empty without him.  I know he won't let me go back to him because it is not what is best for me, but I don't feel like I can live without him in my life.  I am thinking about calling him or emailing him and begging him to take me back.  I don't know if this is relevant or not, but I suffer from PTSD, BPD and an eating disorder.  What should I do?
