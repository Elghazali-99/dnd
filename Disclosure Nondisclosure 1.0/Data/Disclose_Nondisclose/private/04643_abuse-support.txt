I don't really know how to state what I am feeling I mean...i have a lot of things going on in my head right now. I have been suicidal and depressed and everything. I have a bad history of abuse in my past of all kinds: the earliest abuse being when I was molested as an child (8 yrs old) and the most recent being this past October when I was in a abusive relationship in college... . Lately it has been bothering me really badly. I have been having flashbacks, and nightmares, and I can't sleep or stay asleep or anything. Its really interfering with my boyfriend and my relationship and just my life in general. The feelings I am having or overwhelming [it also seems to be making my bipolar disorder symptoms more intense also]. I don't know what to do at all. I have been so suicidal and just stressed that my boyfriend doesn't even let me shave my legs without coming in the bathroom to check on me and he has taken away my scissors and my knifes and there are no pills of any type in my room. I don't know what to do at all though...
