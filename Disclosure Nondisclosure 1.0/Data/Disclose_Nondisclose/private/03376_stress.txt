I have set a keypad lock on my mobile phone and I use it so often that I type my password to unlock my keypad almost 10 to 15 times a day. I have had the same password for more than 4 months, so I know the password very well because I use it many times a day, everyday for the last 4 months. 
Recently, one fine day, I didn't seem to remember the password. I tried every single combination that I could, but I still couldnt re-collect the 5 digit password that I had used almost 15 times everyday for the last 4 months. I couldnt remember at all! Is this normal? It took me a couple of hours to remember the code. I have been going through trememdous stress of late but I am young and healthy with no physical problems and I am not on any medications. I am 22 years old. I am shocked that this could happen.
 And almost 2 weeks after that incident, I forgot the password to my Gmail account and I feel exactly the same, because I log into my email almost 10 times a day by typing in the password, and I have had the same password for over 6 months! How could I forget it?
 Please help. I am worried about what is happening. Thank you very much.
