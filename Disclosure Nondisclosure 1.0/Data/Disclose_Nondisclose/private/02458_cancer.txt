My husband recently diagnosis with primary liver caner, according to CT scans and recent MRI's its still contained in the liver but throughout both lobes of the liver. this make him limited to different options offered, his platelet count low related to hep-c, he mainly drops off to sleep during the day, no significant pain, nausea, or bleeding, he does suffer severe leg cramps at night and some cramping or muscle spasms in his hand, no jaundice either, but he experienced a lot of itching at times, not on any treatment yet, expected to start on Nexavar soon and hoping for the best, no other treatment options offered. Can diet play a role along with medication help prolong survival longer than  usually indicated. I heard of an alkaline diet vs an acidic diet, heard of controlled amino acid therapy and different foods which helps to starve the cancer cells, trying to help him before cancer spreads outside of liver and to different organs. he continues to work, but tires easily, his AFP blood levels recent results currently at 22000. Is it too late to do something, oh! esopgeal varices not bad, please reply, need serious help, he is only 59 y/o and my husband of nine years. thank you
