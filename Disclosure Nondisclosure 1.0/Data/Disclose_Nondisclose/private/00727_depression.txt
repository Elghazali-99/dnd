I have been to the doctors recently in trying to fix my mental health, After informing them that I was feeling depressed with anxiety, they gave me a prescription for citalopram. I could not get therapy for three or four months, so for some reason I didn't bother with it, hoping in time that the citalopram would get me back on my feet.
 The citalopram at first helped me throughout the first two months, but then I started getting worse, I had really bad anxiety around people, so I stopped it all together. Many people have told me that they think I might have a bipolar disorder, my history has been quite troubling as I have done many things spontaneously that I consider afterwords completely mad for e.g. Borrowing a lot of money from payday loans even though knowing fully well that I couldn't afford to pay it back, getting fired for unlawful social networking, stealing money from my parents...
 I seem to have constant mood swings throughout the day. It has affected relationships with many people, friends family and previous girlfriends. Whenever I go out with friends, I seem to have problems. When drunk I tend to have no control and end up doing something very harmful to others around me, people have noted that my mood seems to change drastically when drinking and or taking other drugs. I have missed many interviews for important jobs because of getting intoxicated the night before, I have trouble maintaining my sleeping pattern, I over eat or don't eat at all, I have had in the past, problems with leaving the house and being outdoors.
 My question is, Is there anyone I can talk to about this ? So that I can hopefully get a better understanding as to why I am doing this. Possibly someone that has had the same experiences.
