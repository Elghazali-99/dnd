Hello 
 My son is 23 was really bright and about a 1 1/2 years ago started having problems with pot. He has about 6 months to finish college and lost his job in August -  he was a computer programer. He is in debt and has no real friends and lost his drivers license because of speeding tickets and becasue he did not show up to court. 
 My son really had a few bad days last week. He started hallucinating and burning stuff in his room the middle of the night. It was really scary. 
 Well what happen was that my husband came home from lunch and my son was posted at our front door like a soldier with an ax… So my husband asked him if he wanted some help and he said yes. Right away he took him to mental health and they admitted him. He was tested – urine and blood – and all he tested positive for was pot, no meth, no nothing else. We are not sure but our son had said that he had taken some mushroom tea??? But  that was not found on the results… it could be that he needed a different test… 
He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and after 3 different medications he is now taking Geodon. 
 After three days there he was released and he is back with us. We are waiting for the medicine to take effect. He seems a little better and is sleeping through the night at least, but he is still having disorganized thoughts, paces a lot, and can’t really sit still. Today he did tell me that he was craving pot because it calmed him down?? I don’t think he thinks that he has a drug problem but I do think he knows that something is wrong. We are planning on going to some support groups as a family with NAMI ( National Assoc. for Mental Illness). 
 Things are really rough and to some degree we are feeling hopeless because now we are not just dealing with a drug problem but also mental illness. Please pray for us and if anyone has any advice it is much appreciated
