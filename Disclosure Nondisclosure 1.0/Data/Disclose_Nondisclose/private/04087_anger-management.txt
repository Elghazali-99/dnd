I've had this problem for years and really thought I was making some progress. I get easily irritated and have been really doing better with the people I live and work with until recently. I used to take anti depressants and smoke and before took dope but now don't do any of it and off of SSRI'S for 2 years. I had a few things go wrong lately with my computer and the person I share  a house with and started coming un-glued during some exchanges but caught myself before I crossed the line, well before probably. Then today I had to play music at a community christmas play which was very un organized  with a good friend and some other friends. Today was the performance and we were supposed to have a  dress reahursal before but a blizzard came right  before the start and no  sheet music was given and I had to insist on a song list etc. and then lost track of my new leather jacket and started coming unglued more than the previous incidents I mentioned. I found my jacket but It didn't turn out too well and though I didn't loose control, people knew I was upset. I feel terrible about this and left right after and wonder if anyone has any experience with this. thanks
