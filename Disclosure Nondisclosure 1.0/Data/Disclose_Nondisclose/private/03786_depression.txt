I am really lost, today I had an event which caused me to be a little bummed. But for the most part I was fine. On my way home this evening I suddenly felt very sad, like really sad. I was thinking about how I was so tired of what was happening and I jist wanted it to change. When I got home I crawled into bed and was just very upset. I slept,for a few hours and when I woke up I still had this feeling i can't quite explain... The best way would to say that it was very dark Like i literally had not a single happy thought. I was 100% negative and...dark.  I didn't want to talk, I had no appetite, I wanted to cry and I felt very lethargic...almost like any movement was just to much effort and not worth it.
 I am 18 a female.
i have had a couple times when i was (what i consider) to be very depressed. Only during moments in my life where it was explainable.
ex: in elementary school i was picked on and bullied to the point of not want to go to school and just sitting in the dark and being sad.
 and when i had a relationship end i was EXTREMELY emotional and it was like i was a totally different person. Didn't leave my room stayed in bed and cried, lost appetite, no motivation. 
i also remember having this time for a couple of day when i was so depressed in my mood that i cut myself. I have never done that since and now that i am older I regret such an action. But for all of these occasions remember the same darkness inside me and around me.  Just eating away.
 i have never asked the doctor because i have never been worried until now. Maybe i am over reacting, but I just dont understand why i can drop my mood so severally and quickly. I am a very happy person on a normal day so its such an extreme difference. Like right now although i am sad i am in a much better mood its very concerning.
 So i guess my question is, Does anyone know anything about why this is happening? And if so should i be concerned and what can i do about it?
