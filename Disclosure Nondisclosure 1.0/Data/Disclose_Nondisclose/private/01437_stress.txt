There is an old saying “Act in haste and repent at leisure”.
  Are things as bad as you say? Have you put up with things long enough? Have you or your partner blown things out of all proportion? And so the list goes on and on.
  One minute you are in each other's’ arms, the next you find yourself at arm’s length. You tell yourself, it’s their job; it’s their mother; it’s the children; it’s it’s it’s...... Again the list just goes on and on.
  Right, there is a problem! Have you tried talking to them? Yes - but you go over the same ground in ever diminishing circles, the temperature rises and one or other slams the door.
  Clearly you need help. A generation or two ago [or more] when large families were the norm you would have taken the advice of seasoned older relatives. Like your big sister / brother /aunt or Granny.Now large families do not exist and if they do they are miles away. But in this modern world they have been replaced by various professionals - counsellors, therapists, mediators , Divorce Procedureand so on.
  But just like the hardened alcoholic and smoker, you are unlikely to move forward and resolve the situation unless you take that simple step - admit you need help.
