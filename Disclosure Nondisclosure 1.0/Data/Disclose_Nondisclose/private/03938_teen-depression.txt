I am easily upset and stressed by a lot of thing. I have panic attacks and crying spells (when I can't stop myself from crying). I grew up very insecures, worried, and always feeling alone. I was so miserable just at the age of six that I started vividly daydreaming that I was someone else just so I could escape reality. My mother frequently dumped on me and I had to comfort her and reassure her. I was her stress dummy. Whenever she was stressed, she would verbally abuse me and take away my privileges (she never treated my younger siblings this way). She would criticize my weight (I was bulimic at 15 and started having hypoglycemia and irregular heart beat), she criticize all the things I enjoyed doing (this lead me to stop enjoying the present and to only hope for a better future), and she belittle my efforts when I tried really hard (and she hates when people does this to her). I was homeschooled by my mother, so I grew up very sheltered. My father hated that my mom didn't work, so they would argue and fight all the time. This made me scared of my father until recently. 
 So now I'm in college and I'm stressed out of my mind. I keep crying and I can't make myself stop, even through relaxation, breathing, and listening to music. I don't want medication, I just want a technique that going to help me become strong. I'm broken and my mother made sure of that (although she won't admit it and now tells my siblings that they should not be crazy like me). Although I have confronted her several times that she made me weak, all she does is comes against the little strength (the hope of a better future and always giving a 100  percent). I need to be strong and I just don't know how.
