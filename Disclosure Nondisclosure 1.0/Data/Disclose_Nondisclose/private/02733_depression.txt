Hi, I struggle with MDD, PTSD and Anxiety. I was taking Proxac for 3 years it worked prety well. I ran out and a friend  gave me zolft to get me through to my Dr appoinment. It worked awesome. I was on it for 3 years and my life was together.  I ended up with a large tumor on an ovary. I was given a pain meds for about 4 months. After surgery, I went through a slight withdrawl (  2-3 days of headaches). However my zoloft stopped working and my Dr put me on Brintellix 10 mg. It worked okay but on the start of my 3rd month I started having  suicidal thoughts. I started crying for hours at a time. It has been a week since I have taken it (which I would never do with Zoloft).  I know I need to get on someting quick. I am wondering if I ask to go back on zoloft and go up 50mgs to total 150 mgs a day.  I also take  Clonazpem 1mg a day.  Or was there another drug out there that people had a good experiance with zoloft and another drug? I feel better without the Brintellix but I know I need something. Help! I do not want to spiral again. I bought a house and finally repaired my life after depression killed it.
