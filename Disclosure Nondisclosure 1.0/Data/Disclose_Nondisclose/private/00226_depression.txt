I had a ectopic with twins about 8-9 weeks ago they were 7-8 weeks when they were taken from me. Then this week i found out i was yet again pregnant. I was filled with joy thought maybe just maybe we will have our second bundle of joy. But no god took it from me 4-5 weeks along and misscarried yet again :'( 
I have been taking preg vitimins and have been eating healthy and not eating abything not ment to eat :( im starting to think im not built for having babys this is my 3rd misscarrage and my first ectopic that hurt the most knowing i didnt loose the one i lost 2 and had no choice in the matter then to say goodbye to my beating heart babys :'( i try to stay strong but im hurting and crying so much :'(
 The reason i ask if this is my punishment is because when i was 16 i fell pregnant and have aborted people say im wrong but the reason behind my doing is more then understandable i reakon as i fell pregnant to rape. And it was only rape it was rape by a family member.
 I still get s*** from my family every day they say that its because of the abortion and that i shouldnt of done it i should of put it up for adopition or something but not abord it. 
 Is it crazy for me to feel like i have dine the right thing yet still getting punished ??
 Please be honest.
