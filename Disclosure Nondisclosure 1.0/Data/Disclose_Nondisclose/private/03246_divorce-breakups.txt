I posted back in October that I was conflicted about what to do with my husband. Since then, we mutually decided to go through the divorce process. I feel good about it. I feel great about me. I'm looking forward to my future. I'm getting a ton of support - coworkers, family, friends. 
 At the moment, we're in the middle of the waiting period for the state. I'm having to "fake" the relationship to keep it civil. The unfortunate thing is I slip sometimes and he gets upset. He does not know that I'm "faking" it. I have to keep telling myself that I can not worry about him, that this will be over. Oh, basically through the last few years, I've been emotionally abused. That's what I want freedom from. He also tries to drag me down the rabbit hole with him. The faking part comes in when he rants for an hour or so about people/ the world. Again, I keep the mantra in my head that this too shall pass. I will be through with it. 
 So, I am seeing light at the end of this. I just have to keep at not getting sucked into him. I am a good person and I am looking forward to a new life. Please keep me in your thoughts. 
 Thanks!
