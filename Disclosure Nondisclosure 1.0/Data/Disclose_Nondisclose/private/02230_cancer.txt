To Start at the beginning about a year and a half ago my father started having severe pain and trouble urinating. Over a course of 6 months he was seen in the ER and it was DX as Kidney stones he was treated and sent home. On the fourth visit they noticed a growth and finally sent him to a urologist and did biopsies. He was diagnosed with stage III Bladder cancer. The repeated the scan which occurred about 4 weeks after the original and the scan showed a small spot on his spine and the tumor on bladder had doubled in size. After biopsy it came back + for cancer and it was stated he has stage IV cancer. They stated the cancer was on the outside of the bone not the inside. So he did chemo he did 4 or 5 rounds where he went once a week for 3 weeks then 1 week off. It shrunk in half. After the last follow up the chemo is no longer working and the tumor is starting to grow. They do not feel the need to remove the bladder as they feel its an unnecessary procedure. But due to his stent failing multiple times hes having surgery to have it replaced quite often. Now they want him to do chemo every 3 weeks with radiation as well. 
My questions are as follows 1. Why wouldn't removing the bladder be beneficial in my perspective it lets them focus on the spot on the spine. As well as prevent multiple surgeries for new stents. 2. Is there any experimental procedures or experimental drugs to try? 3. What is the expected survival rate 1 year 2 years? Or even less?
