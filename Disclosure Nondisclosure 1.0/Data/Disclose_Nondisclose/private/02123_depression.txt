I would like say right now. What you are about witness is probably the most irrational and stupid thing to be depressed about. But like everyone, I can't keep my feelings all bottled up. To start, I'm a 19 year old male living in Scotland, United Kingdom who joined this site recently to help with my feelings. 
  To be truthful, when I was born doesn't go well with how I was born, if you know what I mean. I totally wish I was born just like, 5 years earlier so I can experience more 90s stuff, or better yet, born in the late 70s, so I can experience both the 80s AND the 90s (I was born in 1994 but wished it could've been 1989). Everyday, I feel that I'm look down upon by people older than me as if I'm a "kid" or that I'm another one of those teens who's addicted to technology and stuff. Granted, I can be quite the internet addict, but I do OTHER things as well! I draw, exercise, hang out with a few friends in the town and occasionally go for a drink. But I still can't help but feel inferior to them since they probably grew up with WAY more stuff from the 80s and 90s than I did. Now I DID grow up with many memorable cartoons from those decades, grew up with classic Disney instead of the shite Disney usually does nowadays and I morely remember using VHS tapes than DVDs but still, I wish I could have a connection with the 90s more... 
  Not only that, I wish I could've been a teen throughout the 2000s instead of a hybrid, so I can experience the golden days of YouTube and deviantArt. I did experience it for a while until they got shite too. This is why I'm jealous and envy of my older sister, since she was born 5 years earlier than I was..
