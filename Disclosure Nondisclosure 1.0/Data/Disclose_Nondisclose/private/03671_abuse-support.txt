I have a step grandson that just turn 5 and I also have a grandson from my oldest daughter that turn 1 in september 2010. the problem we have is both my girls have moved back home so the 2 boys are together everyday. The 5 yr went over and slap the baby when he was in his highchair.(For Cry). We all told him that he was wrong for doing that and even if the baby or anybody else did do something wrong you would not slap them in the face or hit. he was also was put in time out. This morning my oldest daughter had to go out and left the baby w/ the dad and his 5 yr old the dad fell asleep and when my youngest came up stairs she found her son on top of the baby and he had put 2 pillows over his face and was pushing down hard. This has me very scared that he is going to hurt or even kill my grandson. I do not like the word step when it comes to family members but I wanted you to know. He has been the only grandson in both sides of his fathers family but now both aunts had babies in 2009. What should we do? Help Please
