Twin,  61, died 2/12-renal cell carcinoma that despite multiple health concerns and paraplegia, went unfelt and un-medically noticed until he suffered a cough induced rib fracture. He died 
in 2 weeks! Me? multiple medical problems. e.g.,18 Spontaneous  Pneumothoraces in both lungs/Ehlers Danlos-Syndrome Type 4. I've 
had kidney stones since I was 16. Some obstructing, many more not. Only occasionally noticed visible blood re: obstructing. For a long time-months, maybe longer, I've suffered cramping/dull ache in left kidney area. I've hurt here so long I'm having occasions of hematuria & occult blood. I know this because-despite my asking with each stone, if my kidney's could be damaged from them (and, one, more concerned I was 'drug shopping' than my pain-passed the stone next a.m.). To them, the question must seem Hypochondriacal since I still don't know after 20 years, but my concern is, This debilitating, intense  discomfort is more of a concern re: the sneaky Renal Cell Carcinoma 'appeared' and  there's blood more often , for longer periods, and no stones! I've finally began stick testing my urine. Used to be,most often,hematuria, (but more and more often, occult). 
My urine exhibits cloudiness and, in a urinal lays thick after settling. My twin's sudden diagnosis and sudden death have made me a bit concerned; 
Question: Should I push harder for an answer...and, should I be more...patient?
