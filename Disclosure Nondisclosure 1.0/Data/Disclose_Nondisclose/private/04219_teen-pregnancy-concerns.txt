sorry for tmi lol
So last month, in February my period was supposed to start on the 16 and it never did but the it start on the 1 of march. it ended on march 4. my periods used to be every 28 days for 3 days straight. but now. i was late on tht one and now im late again. its april 17. i havent reslly had sex. my boyfriend only stuck the tip in but it was for like 2 minutes. he said he didnt do anything but its still scaring me because i havent had my period. ive been puking and im really tired. my boobs arent sore though. i dont want to tell my mom because shes automatically going to assume i did something and i dont want her to know anything happened. someone please just help. 
ps-ive been having my period since i was 9 or 10 and the only time ive missed a period was my second month of having them. i think im just stressing myself out too much and im just gonna be late again. maybe its just from my body not knowing wht tht was because ive never fingered myself or anything before. not hes did both things. what should i do?
