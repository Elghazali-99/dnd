I have been taking Lexapro 10 mg for almost a year. Sometimes I just take 5 mg because I feel so miserably lethargic in the morning. On a few occasions I have woke in the night a bit confused. Most of the time, I just can't remember what the next day is and what I am suppose to do when in the morning. But I have had two especially disturbing times. One was when I woke and was frightened that there was a man (my husband) in my bed. I jumped out of bed and would have run, but I realized that my thinking was wrong. Sounds funny, but at the time I was terrified. For about five minutes, I stood on the side of the bed trying to process what was going on. It took longer to relax and go back to sleep.  The next time I woke up frightened because I didn't know where I was. This wasn't just feeling disoriented. I felt like I was in a dangerous place and like I needed to run. Again, it took a two or three minutes before I could figure things out and go back to sleep after the frightening feelings left. I don't recall any dreams.Though, I have had disturbing dreams in the past, I have always known what is real and feel relief when awake. The prolonged fear is what bothers me. (Just so you know, I have a very happy and loving family.) Could this be because of the Lexapro or is my mind just really disturbed?
