I'm 15 and last year my doctor told me she wanted me to go see a psychiatrist because I was self-harming and i had attempted od'ing on pills which only got me really sick but my parents ended up not finding out. I never took her suggestions because I was afraid to tell my parents what had happened and I didn't want them to think any differently of me, be ashamed of me, etc. I stopped cutting & burning, but the thoughts of committing suicide are sometimes still there. Like I'll be walking and sometimes i'll just stop in the middle of the street to see if a car will hit me ( stupid I know) but the feeling of not wanting to be here anymore just overwhelms me sometimes. Summer is half over and I spent majority of it in my room by myself unless I had to go out with my parents. My friends used to ask me to go do things with them but gave up cause I always say no. I just don't feel like going out or doing anything. Sometime I sleep for over 12 hours & others times I don't sleep for 2 days. I don't think I'm depressed though because I still laugh and stuff with my family. I also get mild panic attacks when i'm listening to music on my ipod and other people are around and i got panic attacks in the hallways unless I took a different route to go to class (which usually made me late & my school is over-populated). I just don't understand what is wrong with me? Sorry for writing so much.
