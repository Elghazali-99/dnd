Let's just say I am a 15 year old girl who has been struggling for a while. I literally feel the same everyday. Ugly. Fat. Unwanted. Fat. Nobody will ever be attracted to me. Fat. All that stuff. I'm anxious and fidgity all througout the day. Nobody can look at my side profile for my head, I can't wear t-shirts, I hardly wear my glasses (Feeling I look unattractive in them), I stay up as late as I can at night so I don't fall asleep and have to wake up in the morning to go to school, I feel like a lot of people at my school either dislike me a lot, think I'm ugly, or just never want to bother with me (Boys), I cry a lot at night for no reason, unless it's about how I'm so self-loathing, I'm judgemental just to make myself feel not so bad, I literally feel like hey why not just end it all so I don't have this **** feeling inside of me 95% of the time.
 The thing I don't get is at the same time, I'm happy with my friends, I laugh a lot, and I have fun with them.
 This is pathetic, and it may seem like I'm just out for attention, but I just DON'T want to feel like this everyday!!!!!
