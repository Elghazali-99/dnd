I'M 15,and Yeah I have been posting a few questions then normal,but I've got a lot to ask,Anyway,I was wondering if I could Possibly have something similar or alike to schizo, my parents say I'M cold and emotionless, and that is always have a blank expression on my face,I have weird impulses to do things,as in hurt others or something, but I can hold myself back,as well as I tend to lie with out realizing, even to the persons face,I get angry and mad really fast,and anything can set me off,even the things I say,I hate sound in general,and I hate hearing anyone's voice,I Can't stand laughter, I talk to myself a lot,and sometimes I feel like something or someone responds, Which is weird, I told my mom about it,and she didn't take any mind to it,she always says she's considered taking me to a therapist but never dose,when I was 7 I actually did go to one,and they gave me pills for adhd and said I had add?, I mainly went because the school councils said I said that I didn't love my mom, as well as they say I back empathy, and pity for people, and that I don't smile at all,could it be drepression?
