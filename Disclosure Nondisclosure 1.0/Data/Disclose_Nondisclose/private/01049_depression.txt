I lost my Mum, my rock, my best friend on Aug 24 2009. I wasn't allowed to see her and didn't get to say goodbye. 4 yrs on and I still haven't been able to accept she's really gone. We say "I lost my mum" like there is still the possibility of finding her again. I still hope she'll call me or turn up at my door. I didn't get to see her or say goodbye. I am still struggling to cope with everything. I have little motivation to do anything. I have to push myself to do everything. I'm tired all the time. I forget and reach for the phone to tell her things all the time. Good things that happen are tainted as I can't share them with her. I feel like I've been on hold since she left. I'm just pretending to live my life and trying to act normal. I feel jealous of people who talk about seeing their mum in dreams, having contact both physical and mental and "feeling her around them"! I've had nothing, despite speaking to numerous mediums, which makes it even harder to accept she's really gone and get past the sadness and loss although In a way I don't want to accept it as I don't want to believe it! The hole in my heart feels like its getting bigger and the bigger it gets the more painful it gets. I struggle to talk about it as I shouldn't still be struggling like this should I?? And you don't want to still be burdening friends and family after 4 years but I need help! And the one person who I would normally turn to when I'm feeling sad or need help or advice isn't available.....
