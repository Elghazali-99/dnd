Its been nearly 2 months since my boyfriend and I broke up. I have followed the advice of others and made no contact and have deleted  him from Facebook, his number from my phone and avoided places where he would likely be. I had a troubled relationship with him and after talking to my therapist about his behaviour which the therapist said sounded passive aggressive. So I searched PA on the internet. And it was him to a  T !! all his behaviour, his punishing me by not seeing me for 4 days, his inability to discuss an issue and resolve it, the lack of trust i had in him because I felt he was not honest and the feeling of walking on eggshells that I had with him. ( but when he was great he was great and there is no one else I would want to spend my time with) So I understand that this is not someone I should be involved in. My head tells me so but my heart still feel like I want to see him. I miss him like crazy. I have tried to reconnect with my old friends and have been socializing with them but feel a distance between us. Part of the reason is that they are not HIM. I have been feeling better in the last 2 weeks ( not crying anymore, feel more postitive about the future etc) but I would not say I am happy. dont really know where to go from here. I feel in limbo. I am lonely and sad.  Another thing is I have to see him in about 3 weeks. It is a long arranged function that is impossible to get out of ( too hard to explain it here). I am getting nervous about it already. On one hand I want to see him but on the other its going to be painful to actually see him because my emotions are very close to the surface.
