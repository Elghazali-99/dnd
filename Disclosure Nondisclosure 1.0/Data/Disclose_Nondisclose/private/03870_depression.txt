I have this depressive feeling that lasts all day everyday even though I'm not thinking about it and despite the fact that I'm doing things to cope with it.  This feeling is that depression releases stress hormones which kills neurons (including the neurons responsible for pleasure).  I feel that the depression I am experiencing from this information is already killing off my neurons responsible for pleasure.  I'm not afraid of losing any other neurons responsible for other things--just the neurons responsible for pleasure.  In other words, I'm not depressed about losing my intelligence--I'm depressed about losing my neurons responsible for pleasure.
 The information is explained in this video (where it states that MRI imaging has shown neurons become less active and erode).
 I have tried everything to cope with this information (even constantly telling myself positive things such as that the brain grows new neurons).  But this information still persists in bothering me all day everyday.
 Also, as a side note, it used to be believed that we lose neurons everyday, but we don't.  Our neurons live on for the rest of our lives.  But this information from this video states that depression kills them.
 However, there is only one thing that would ease this feeling from this information.  Which would be if this information has not been proven (in other words, if those MRI images that show neuron loss may somehow be wrong and can't be proven).  Or do those MRI images stated in the video prove that depression kills neurons?
