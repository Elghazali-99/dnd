I made a post a couple of weeks ago regarding my boyfriend with BPD. Today, I had a very important interview for my career. I came back to a message from him. Last night he had a crisis and took himself to the hospital he has attended before. I was shocked. I knew he had been depressed but i talked to him last night and he seemed fine. We have been together 2 years and live in different countries. I am a supportive partner and I always let him know I love him and can deal with his bad times. He was telling me how much he loved me and how he hopes I will bear with him whilst he gets help. I let him know I am not going to disappear and that he is totally loved and that all I care about right now is his safety
I feel upset. How did things go bad so fast? I also worry he will push me away when he gets out and want to end the relationship. I don't want to stress him but don't want to lose him either. I am not sure how to deal with this and feel very concerned for him and for us as a couple
Any help would be very welcome
Thank you
