Im 18 and I've been realizing that im really stressing out a lot. I get angry over little things. And become very frustrated. Sometimes i also become very emotional and cry for no reason. I've also isolated myself from all my friends this summer just to hang out with my boyfriend. I also like to isolate myself from my family and i don't like to be bothered by anyone. So i go in my room and curl up in my blakets and watch tv. The only person that doesn't bother me as much would be my boyfriend. But if he's not with me i get frustrated and start fighting with him because he hasn't come over yet. I really just wanna find out what will help calm me down and relax me. I think alot of my stress has to do with the fact that my parents are splitting up and going to be getting a divorce. That's when i realized that i was becoming real stressed out. I was thinking about asking my mom to get me on a pill t calm me down but idk if there are other ways of calming down besides being on meds. 
If anyone has any advice to give me about calming myself down, id greatly appreciate it.
