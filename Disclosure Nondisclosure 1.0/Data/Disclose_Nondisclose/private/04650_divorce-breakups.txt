I have never cheated on my husband.   I recently found out he obtained a go phone.  Although I've never seen it, I did find some entries on his web browser that are undeniable proof that he activated one.   The visited web pages can only be reached by signing with an account.   They're very precise web pages.   I confronted him but he denies it.    He cries and says I'm mistaken ( Only seen him cry twice in 20+ years and it's been death related). He says it wasn't him.   We live alone and nobody visited us on the days that coincide with the dates on the history....Also it was on his personal Kindle fire and not on the laptop that's available to guests.   I have suspected him of cheating for the last two years.  He put me through hell!   I feel extremely hurt and angry!  I feel like treating him the way he has treated me.  Letting think everything is ok and having hard hot sex with someone I find attractive.   I know this sounds immature but at the moment I don't know what else to do.
