I'm a depressed 16 year old female who has been going through some really bad problems for the past few years. 
 First of all, I live in a poor family in a small town in the south. Nothing to do, nothing new to see. Just boring. I'm not close with any other family, my more distant family seems to dislike or forget about me. I live with my Father (who I am close to) my Mother and my 21 year old Brother. I am home schooled due to extreme anxiety.
  Lately I've just felt no reason to continue. My mother seems to love my brother than me, she babies him, doesn't make him get a job so he just gets to sleep all day and mooch off of us. He is also violent at times, punches holes in the walls. He has cussed me out and my parents say nothing to him. I'm trying to find a job currently since I just turned 16 this month. To make this worse, I'm in love with someone miles and miles away. Thankfully I get to talk to them online everyday but I just wish I could leave and be with them. We well get to meet when I turn old enough to travel but it feels so far away. 
 I feel like things wont get better till I'm with them since they are the only thing that makes me happy anymore. I'm becoming suicidal again. I don't self-harm, but I often have thoughts of it. I don't do drugs or drink alcohol, in fact I've never gotten into any legal trouble.  I'm actually on the outside straightedge kid. The kind who wont do anything to hurt anyone. I don't know what to do anymore. If things don't change soon I don't know what I'll do. I just need advice
