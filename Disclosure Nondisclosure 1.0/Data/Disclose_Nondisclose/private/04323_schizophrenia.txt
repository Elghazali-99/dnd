My daughter has PTSD psychosis and we recently took her off Seroquel which was causing severe weight gain plus horrible levels of agitation, and was not helping much with the delusions. We started the Geodon for two weeks at 60 mg and there was some improvement in her being able to connect and be affectionate, but her delusions became even more violent so it was doubled to 120 mg. Immediately she lost her appetite even at 60 mg, but now at 120 mg she walks around the house aimlessly and is constantly dry heaving. Since she has to have calories to get the med into her system we have been fighting trying to find calorie compacted healthy foods, but if we get 200 calories into her at dinner we are lucky. She has been taking Prazosin and Paxil for a long time so I know it is not her other meds. In the other post on here I keep finding nausea related to withdrawal from Geodon, but not while on it, have others experienced this? We took her down to 60 mg last night after a week of 120 mg and we are hoping for improvement. Does anyone else have PTSD psychosis? Are there other meds that might work better?
