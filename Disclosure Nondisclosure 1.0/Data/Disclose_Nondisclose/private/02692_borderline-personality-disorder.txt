For over a year now i've been dating a wonderful woman, I love her dearly. She was recently diagnosed as BPD. Right now things are very rough, she has met someone new whom she has intrest in and it's tearing me apart. I'm reading as much as I can to find out more about it all, and I know it's symtomatic of BPD for whirlwind romances and such. I just don't want to lose her to someone who will hurt her. I want to get through all this, I don't want this to be the end. I don't know how or if I can prove to her that we are still worth it, but I don't want to give up without giving it an honest fighting chance. How do I convince her to try with me, it can't just be one sided. As i'm writing this tears are streaming down my face, as she has just left to go and see this other person. I know I can't stop her, nor her feelings, I just want the chance to save what we have or perhaps at this point had. She expects me just to be ok with this, and i'm not nor can I be. Give her space and she runs away, try to much and i'm seen as clingy. We have been through so much, multiple suicide attempts, lots of family tragedy, our own issues, but I don't want to just throw it all away. Is there anything I can do, for the both of us?
 I know perhaps that this new thing might not last, but I can't just sit and wait for that either? I just miss her. 
 Hoping someone has some advice, or at least some ideas on how I can better cope with this. Crying myself to sleep everynight is terrible. 
 I'm sorry.
