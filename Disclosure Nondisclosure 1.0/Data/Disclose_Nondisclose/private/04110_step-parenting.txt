Now I came in the relationship not knowing there was a stepdaughter , until this child first birthday and he told me he had her. And I excepted that because I had two and he excepted them and he also had a son of his own also living with him and I treated him like my own.so I fondly get to meet the baby at the age of one and we took care of her like own when she came down and I don't think the mother new I lived with him at the time because the baby was calling me mama and I let her because her father was find with it and I think she was calling me that because my own children called  me  mama. So the father fondly told her mother I was living with him , she filed for her support and even though he paid this support for this child he continued taking care of this child out of his pocket also , I mean everything this child was needing all through school and now she 17 and he have kind of lited up on giving and now she feels like he don't care for her but we have a child together(son) and I through this taking care of her and him i feel he was losing out because he couldn't get nothing from him unless she need and if she didn't need he went without unless I bought it.and when I explain that to him I have open up a war between us and he quick to tell me no one gone come between him and his daughter. It's not like I'm trying to come between them but she's 17 ready to be 18 and want try to work and help herself , she can't do nothing not even count money . Her mother don't teacher her nothing. Cleaning I try all these years everything to help her learn she acts as if she don't have to, then when I try she thinks I'm picking on her and now that gives her a reason why she doesn't come down and that's driving a problem between me and the dad but he acts like he know what she trying to do but then he really thinks I have something against this child. Long story short I really don't know what I should do? Help
