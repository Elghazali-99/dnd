I have a friend that as a child, he was in an emotionally abusive home.  Often, physical abuse was also involved.  From the time he was a very small child on;  He thought he was completely worthless and would try to die by suffocating himself or stop breathing.  He also would bite his self and pull out his own hair.  He played in his pee and bowel movements fantasizing while he did it several times throughout the day and also constantly day dreamed throughout the day.  He was aware of things going on around him for the most of it and especially enjoyed day dreaming to music.  He would put on music and go into a fantasy world mentally while he physically acted out his mental fantasies.  Playing in bowel movements ended when he was 12 yrs old, but the day dreaming with and without music has continued all through his adulthood.  For the past 5 years, he says that he has not done it as much as he used to.  When he is under a lot of stress, his mind drifts off into a day dream.  He has problems with suicidal thoughts and can go from ok to extremely depressed at a moments notice, if he is upset by anything.  He is not violent though.  When he was younger, other people noticed he was different and as he got older he tried to hide it.  Often times while walking, he fantasized and without realizing it would be looking at the ground and talking to his self or was moving his lips while he fantasied.  He does not have many friends.  He feels like he is much better than he once was, but also feels like he has some kind of mental or personality disorder.  He suffers from big mood swings too, which he's had sense he was in his teens.  Can you tell him what might be wrong?     Sincerely, A friend
