Hello everyone. I have had suspicions about possibly having Borderline Personality Disorder for a little while, but I don't know. I'm very wary of online 'tests' for such things, as they can 'diagnose' you with a multitude of maladies that you don't have, and I also want to make it clear that I'm not self-diagnosing either. I have been thinking about bringing it up with either my counsellor or my GP, but before I do I want to be more sure about it. I don't want them to think I'm some sort of self-diagnosing hypochondriac, you know? Anyway, some things that make me think that BPD could be a possibility:
 - I have very unstable emotions, I always seem to be in a state of deep depression or bursts of euphoria or just emptiness with no feelings at all (I'm not bipolar, there have been questions raised by my former psychologist and doctor about it but it has been ruled out).
- I can be quite impulsive and almost sort of want to make bad decisions and do risky things that could have bad consequences?
- I have a huge fear of being alone, and I almost need people in a way, but at the same time I push everyone away and isolate myself. Sometimes it's almost as if I'm testing who cares enough to stay with me?
- I have a huge issue with self-image (then again I am a teenage girl and what teenage girl doesn't?) which lead to eating problems (I don't see it as an eating disorder exactly, because it comes and goes and I don't think it's as serious as an eating disorder) which became its own problem for me.
- I have had long-standing issues with self-harm and suicide which apparently can be quite common in people with BPD.
- I'm pretty intense. When I get passionate about something, I REALLY get passionate about it. When I get angry, I become REALLY angry. You get the point.
- I get detached from reality sometimes. Like I sort of just zone out completely and nothing feels real and it scares my friends if it happens around them. Like recently, I was out with friends and I was really intensely happy and then I saw an old friend/acquaintance from my past and it reminded me of how much people have changed and I completely withdrew into myself. I couldn't speak. I lost sense of what was around me. It was sort of like I was watching myself in a movie, and I couldn't really control it in a way??
- Sometimes I get urges to completely re-invent myself and become someone different. Could that be related?
- I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I have a tendency to tell people that I'm not that close with my 'life story', like I'm really desperate for them to like me that I pour my heart out to them, which actually just ends up scaring them away. But on the other hand, with people that I am close with, I can clam up and not want to tell them anything personal about myself, for fear that they will dislike me if they get to know 'the real me'.
 I suffer from depression, which could explain some of the symptoms, but I don't really want to rule out the possibility just because I have depression. And quite a few people with BPD also have problems with depression, don't they?
I should probably say again that I'm a teenager. I know that clinicians can be quite stringent on not diagnosing BPD before the age of 18 at least, and I'm fine with that. I understand that adolescence carries with it a whole lot of ups and downs and that my brain is still evolving itself and all, but I have been experiencing this sort of thing for quite a time now (well over a year) and all I'm asking is whether or not I should approach someone about the possibility of it. I thought I'd ask you lot, since most people here seem so kind and also knowledgeable about these things. I don't really know a whole lot about BPD so any insight would be greatly appreciated. So what do you think I should do?
 Thank you for reading this long post (oops). Your opinion/advice is appreciated.
