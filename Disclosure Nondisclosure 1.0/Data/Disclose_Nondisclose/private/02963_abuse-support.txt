Some of you know my situation already. Now that I'm not talking to bd he is trying to turn everything around on me like it's my fault. I don't text back and he grab the phone from his sister and i didn't say anything. He is mad cause i don't want to talk to him so he said 2 can play that game. Only thing is is that he wasn't talking to me before so Idk what he think he is doing different to hurt me. He just getting on my freaking nerves!! I wish he would realize this is not a game and he is the problem! He act like i shut down just to shut tf down. I had to handle everything that came Mt way at one time from him getting another girl pregnant to him calling me out my name to him trying to put his hands on me. This dead beat don't even come to appoinments!! But now he can't handle me not talking to him!! He want he to wait to he get his **** together and I'm not bout to do it! I love him but i love myself more!! Men can dish out but they can't handle **** when the tables turn!!
