I have been experiencing pain in my stomach and back on the upper left side.  I have also been extremely tired.  My doctor ordered a contrast CT scan and MRI.  They found a 9 mm nodule on my left lung, and several nodules on my thyroid.  They also found that the head of my pancreas show relatively low attenuation.  I am scheduled for an endoscope with fine needle aspiration of the pancreas next week.  I am also scheduled to see an endocrinoligist (spelled wrong...sorry) for a biopsy of the thyroid in two weeks.  Nothing is scheduled for the lung yet.  I am scared to death.  I am a 48 year old woman with almost no family medical history because I am adopted.  As a side note, last year I was admitted into the hospital with severe abdominal pain and vomiting.  They removed my gall bladder, but said that although there were stones, the organ itself was healthy.  I continued to have severe pain.  They went back in the next day, and discovered that two of my liver bile ducts were blocked with stones.  Could this be connected?  Any answers would be appreciated!
