I have a 7 year old step son for 2.5 years now & he is so manipulative although his father excuses this saying how hard the sitiation is for his son. I feel there is no excuse & excusing it is just going to make things worse in the long term.
we now have a 20 month old who he continually tries to teach to be naughty so he can act innocent & blame him. He interups & moves in on any conversation or moment me & his father is having so while he is here we get no time together. He messes up the house, won't respect any rules of keeping tidy & won't even acknowledge I even exsist. I worry he is destroying my 20 month old by sneakily teaching him how to hit etc.
He plays video games continually & expects his father to download, fix, read anything to do with it continually,  demanding he come help him instantly, calling "dad, dad, dad" continually at the top of his voice. strangely his father runs at all his beck & calls yet often ignores me if I need or call him. If my husband is helping me with something or is spending time with our son he will call or do something to make sure he takes the attention from us away & put back on him.
His mum hates me & he has told me they tease me or say unkind things about me when he is with his mum. He has told her lies about me to her & she tells him that I take his dad away from him & his new brother. My husband & his ex wife were separated well before I met my husband... because she was having affairs etc.
My step son is 7 now & I am so frightened he will only get worse with age as I am shocked how manipulative he can be & it has already escalated in the 2.5 years we have been together :(
