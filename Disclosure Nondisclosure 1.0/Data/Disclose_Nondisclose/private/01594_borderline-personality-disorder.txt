I am 25 yrs old... My mother has been critical of me from the time i can have a memory of my choldhood..
whatever i did wasnt good enough.
I was execellent in my studies but she still said i could have done better and found opputunities to hit me with broom or belt or vessels. I always felt like commiting suicide.. 
Once in the 9 th grade I opposed her and told her that my grandmom(her mother) was morally wrong cause she got uncle to marry the second time without a divorce from the first wife(who was really a nice female, her fault was she was dark)..That tiem no ne was at home.. My mom hit me and dragged head by themeshed window of our house and threw me out.. I was bleeding n crying in the front park .. later she told my dad that I was interested i getting ****** by boys who visit the park and thats y she hit me...My dad sent me away from home for my 11th grade.. and its been ten yrs.... My mom did a lot to disturb my studies during those years... she came to my hostel and told dat i was sleeping with my father... I felt embarrased and wanted to commit suicide.....but lived thro it.. today i ve quit my job n am studyin to go ahead for my mba... for tht i came back home... but nuthn has changed... i tried changin my behavior towards her.... wen i was in de job i fulfilled her whims n wishes......but nuth ni s enuf.... my brother cals fro uk n she is happy.. but i by her anythin.. treat her rightn its still bad.. she says i have done nuthn...
I want to brk this pattern, but i dun understand how.my father is stuck cause he married the wron person. I dun feel lik marryin... cus it scares me.... if i turn out to b like her... or my relationship wt other ppl wil turn sour.... i jus want guidance to get rid of de guild tht she's my mother n i shud abandon her
