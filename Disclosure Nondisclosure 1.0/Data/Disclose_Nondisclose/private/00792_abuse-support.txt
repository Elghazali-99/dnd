Hi all,
I posted a while back because I had been tolerating my husband's anger and verbal abuse for so long, that I lost my self esteem and began to believe everything was my fault. I finally found my spine and stood up to him and we both have began individual counseling. I am still learning how to be assertive and he now regards me as "too dangerous to deal with" so now he doesn't interact with me at all. For now, I'm okay with this, but I recently purchased a book (The 
Verbally Abusive Spouse -Can He Change? -A guide to help whether you should stay or go.) and had it sitting under a pile of papers that I'd set in the entry way when I got home from errands this afternoon. After he got home from work, I remembered the book, and I went to relocate it. It was gone, and only he could have moved it. When I asked him if he did, he denied seeing it or moving it. I know he has it, -and he has hid it because he feels threatened by it. Part of me hopes he reads it and gets some feedback from it about his behavior, and the other part of me is furious that he has taken it. I've confronted him once and he's lied. Now what? Do I call him on the carpet for lying and demand my book back ( he will tell me I have a cr@ppy memory, and that he has no idea what I'm talking about) or do I just let this one go? Grr. At this point he is making some really dumb choices if he thinks attempting to control my thinking is going to help matters...~MM
