Okay well I'm 13 and I'm a girl. I'm also a bit of a hypochondriac and I read a lot so keep that in mind.
 Anyway, last year I was really depressed-acting and pessimistic and I thought I was depressed. 
 This year outwardly in front of my friends I'm much more positive, bubbly, confident and outgoing than last year, but inwardly I feel even more insecure. Everything that was bad last year is still bad this year and now things are even worse. Last year I had good grades, all A's, this year I have mostly B's and some C's. Last year I felt like at least my family life was perfect, this year I feel like my family is going to fall apart.
 Reasons why I think I'm depressed:
- I never have motivation to do anything important, but to be honest I've been like that all my life
- I have dermatillomania (not diagnosed by a doctor but considering that I consciously peel/tear skin off myself it's pretty obvious). I've picked my fingers and lips since I was 5, but only this year have I started to do that to the bottoms of my feet, to the point that sometimes I have to walk on my toes all day or with cushiony shoes because otherwise it hurts too much. As far as I know that's self harm.
- Over the past few week I keep crying for no reason and in general I cry very easily. In fact, just 2 days ago my iPhoto was refusing to upload photos so I randomly started sobbing for half an hour. Like, proper wracking sobs. When the tissues I was using fell I started sobbing even harder. That's not normal. Normal people don't do that.
- I'm really sensitive and insecure. Things that don't bother most people much hit me really hard. 
- I'm really anxious
- When I look at symptoms of depression they generally seem to apply to me
 I've gone to a psychiatrist once this year (I actually asked my parents to go) around November or something, but she didn't diagnose me as depressed or anything. Then again, I felt different at the beginning of 7th grade than I do now. She did say I have a lot of anxiety and that she wants to do cognitive behavioral therapy. I never actually went back, I didn't like her. 
 I'm also worried my mom is cheating on my dad.
 I don't know what to do I just feel so weird and hopeless. One of my friends actually, when we were having a kind of emotional talk, said to me, "You're so hopeless. I don't mean that you'll never achieve anything, not that kind of hopeless, but you really don't have any hope for anything, do you?" she said it so sadly. I just kind of laughed and looked away because I didn't know how to say that she got it right on. She knew exactly how I felt. Even though technically since I go to a good school and my family has money, I just don't feel like I'll achieve anything. I don't feel like I'll ever be special. I feel pretty worthless.
 So what's wrong with me? By the way, one thing I have never been is suicidal.
