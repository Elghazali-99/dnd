WOW I understand know why loseing weight is so important to me. Since I I feel my being depressed is so out of control I need something to even out to make me  not feel so out of control. So it's the one thing I can control. But I realized tonight that if I keep clinging to weight for control, it's going to turn around and control me. So when I told myself I need to let go of loseing weight the first thing that pop'd "but I can't because if I do I'll have no control and I'll be hopeless and with out it I'll never be skinny or pretty" so it really made me realize that my weight is ready starting to control me. And since I realized that it because my depression is making me feel out of controle I realized instead of putting all my time and effort into loseing weight I should being putting my effort in to getting over my depression because once it's gone I won't even need weight. 
 So now I'm going to get serious and try and find myself some professional help and I'm going to ask the pastor I've been talking to help me to actually do this an not chicken out. Because if I don't do this now I'm going to end up being totally controlled by my weight. And my youth pastor said she doesn't want to see that happen that it would be sad. So for her and for me I'm taking control of my life while I still can befor it's to late to. I'm taking control by trying to give up what I've been calling control and since I know I can't do that cold turkey I'll do it in the way I can baby step by baby step.
