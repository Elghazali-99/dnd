I have a relative who has been taking Olanzapine for a while now.  I recently found some information that suggests Olanzapine may be associated with brain shrinkage.  Stopping the Olanzapine medication is probably not a safe bet at this moment since this relative is likely to revert back to previous destructive behaviors caused by his/her mental illness, but on the other hand I think it would still be worthwhile to be informed on this as brain shrinkage is also rather concerning.
 These seem to suggest Olanzapine is associated with brain shrinkage (at least in monkeys):

 Others suggest that Olanzapine is actually NOT associated with brain shrinkage - rather, it's only Haloperidol that is:

 I realize that there is no way we can conclude that either of these claims are correct, but does anyone have any guess as to which claims are probably more accurate, and your reasons for thinking this?  My initial response upon reading the above is that Olanzapine is not associated with brain shrinkage in humans, and that it may be associated with brain shrinkage in monkeys but that there is not enough conclusive evidence that Olanzapine was a CAUSE of such brain shrinkage rather than just a correlation.  I'm still not convinced I am on the right track in thinking this though and would like some experts' opinions on this.
