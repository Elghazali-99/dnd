Hello, i wasnt sure which topic to select as my problem relates to a few of them, when i was younger i suffered from ADHD, which went untreated, now i am 19 years old, nearly 20.  I have  big problems with being social with people, never say the right thing, never act myself, i get really anxious, and uncomfortable with situations which i know i shouldnt, when ever this happens i start sweating instantly from the top of my head, i have smoked cannabis constantly since the age of 14, i have stopped now, but this must of had something to do with my behaviour. Also worrying can be quite good, helps for you to keep on top of things, but im sure i worry too much about things that i shouldnt, another problem that i have is that i am sick whenever i get nervous or anxious when i know i am about to go out, or if i am out in a pub. 
 I have been sick so many times now, that i think it is starting to damage my insides, last time after being sick, i couldnt stop retching and ended up bringing up a fair bit of blood.  I had to go out with work today for dinner, but i was acting really strange, and i know its not me, i ended up leaving without saying bye to anyone, and just felt really depressed about it all, please can you advise what this problem might be, and what i should do about it??
