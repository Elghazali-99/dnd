HI Doc!
I want to ask if how much possibility I would get pregnant.
I have irregular period, I thought I will get my period on last week of April because within that week I had stomach cramps. On May 8 there was a small amount of blood on my underwear and it lasted for 1 week and after that week the amount of blood increased but not as much as the amount of my normal period. I forgot when exactly it was gone.
 And this is what happened, 
Last June 13 about 12 am to 1 am I had my first sex with my partner, 
But he said that he didn't ejaculate inside because I was really sleepy so he didn't continue. 
And we were so drunk that's why couldn't remember what happened.
And also I woke up in the morning and found out that I slept beside his friend. 
I'm really confused because what if we had also sex with his friend and they just lied that we didn't.
And I didn't feel any pain with v but my stomach aches and I didn't know which part exactly of my stomach aches.
Is there a big possibility that I will get pregnant if we consider all those things?
I'm really confused and I think I'm getting paranoid.
Help me please.
