So I didn't realize I was raped until I was about 24 years old. I'm 25 now and I think I'm just starting to realize what really happened. I'm devastated by this and I think it has doomed the way I act in relationships. When I was 12 I had a "relationship" with a 16 year old and he coerced me and raped me repeatedly. Sometimes I thought I was willing, and I kept that thought all of my life, until recently I had the epiphany that I WAS JUST A CHILD. I know that seems like, well DUH, but for some reason I never thought of it like that. I spent so much time accepting that I just lost my virginity very young and that it was my own doing and even if I said "no" occasionally I was still basically asking for it.
 I cannot believe how much damage this has really done to me. I'm not even sure if I fully understand the damage it's done. I've never had a healthy relationship, that's for sure. And I've always struggled with mental illness. I'm struggling really hard with my grip on reality. 
 Yesterday I think I was triggered. I thought I saw him. It looked exactly like him from the side profile. I freaked, hid my face, and walked FAST to my car, locked the car and just sat there shaking. Finally I drove off and just cried forever while driving home. I got home and told my boyfriend what happened, and how I'm really struggling with this now, after more than a decade of blaming myself and acting out. WTF am I supposed to do? I feel so screwed up and it's like I'm battling so many diseases and demons. I'm just tired. 
 I don't think there's really a question here I just feel like I'm going nuts. I've been dealing with so many triggers lately it's horrifying.
