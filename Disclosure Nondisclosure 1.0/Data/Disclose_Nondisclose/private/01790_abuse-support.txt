So I'm not sure what is/ was wrong with me as a child that I had these thoughts/ feelings?  Was I abused and don't remember? Am I some sort of psycho? 
     As a child I had very strong sexual thoughts/ desires that I could not get rid of even though I felt terrible about it. It had to have started by at least 6 - 8 years old (possibly earlier). Don't really remember. 
   Anyway, I remember things like spending my time on long car trips imagining being married and doing sexual things. I was often fighting off thoughts of getting my sister (5 years younger than me) to do sexual things with me. I hated these thoughts and never followed through with any of them. I also constantly had intrusive thoughts that I was bad and needed to be punished to the extent that I would end up locking myself up in my room when nobody else was around, pulling down my pants and spanking myself with a belt.  I don't have any memory of anyone doing anything to me other than that of a boy pulling down his pants in front of me. His foster mother found us and I just remember adults being upset and me feeling like I did something really bad.
