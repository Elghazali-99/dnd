Over the last few years I have felt my anger getting more and more intense. I get angry with other drivers on the road. I get angry at inanimate objects (for instance when I can't get a shirt off a coat hanger).  I get angry when I'm lied to. I get angry when I'm not listened to - and so on and so on.
 Today was a turning point for me where I realised I have a serious issue. My partner and I are due to move house soon so we started getting things sorted. We had a silly argument over the fact I went out this morning to help a friend out and I was home later than I expected to be. During the argument I started shouting at her asking "what the f**k is going on? Why are we arguing?" After a while she left the room and I put my fist through a door.
 I've never lashed out after a row with my partner before. She has told me she's now scared of me. I don't want my partner feeling like this about me.
 This isn't the first time I've been violent/threatening when I'm angry. I've never been violent or threatening towards my girlfriend, but with other people I have been.
 Why am I getting to the point of violence of silly things?
