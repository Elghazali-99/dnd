I rang him nicely and said he could come over and get some things I dont want (dont worry nothing valuable) and left the message on his answering machine....and then he rang and said he wont come around unless our son is here and I so no, because I dont want our son involved in our problems, then he said he wanted to record the whole conversation while he is here.....I couldn't not believe what he was saying in a cold and rude voice....I said dont worry about it then.....when I hung up I didn't cry..so that is great progress, andthat made me stronger....then he called later and said I will be there at 4pm....he demanded it.....and I said no....I said we should try to be nice to each other so children aren't hurt so much.....he said that he was not interested in that right now.....my best friend for 30 years....trades me in for a 22yr old bimbo and he still thinks I will wait for him....hell I dont know what he is thinking and I really dont care anymore.....thanks to the wonderful people on here I am really getting stronger....so remember I am the boss of me now......may be he didnt get the memo......
