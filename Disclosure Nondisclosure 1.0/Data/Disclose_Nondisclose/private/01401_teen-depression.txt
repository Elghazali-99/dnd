Ok so my girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over 5 months and she recently has opened up to me about how she has been feeling. She explained to me how she has been depressed for at least a year I think but she hasnt explained how long it has been. She has cut herself several times when she feels really bad about herself. She lacks confidence in herself and cant give herself credit for the good in herself. If I compliment her she accepts it and enjoys when I tell her she's beautiful and that I'll support her and what not. But I've rarely seen her when she gets depressed because she is always in a good mood when she sees me, but when she feels depressed is at night. I've read that this is because you settle down at night and concentrate more on the depression? She is extremely independent and is hard headed which is why I don't understand how she can't get so depressed. We have talked about it a couple times and she does not want to take meds and I'm assuming she doesn't want to do therapy. I don't know if there are any other options for her. I've tried all I can do myself and it has had a little change in her, she usually doesn't hurt herself now but I would love if she didn't feel this depression that she feels during most of the nights but I need help and advice cause its not like she's some person who is crazy and isn't in the right mind, she is completely perfetly normal and she is an absolutely gorgeous girl. PLEASE HELP
