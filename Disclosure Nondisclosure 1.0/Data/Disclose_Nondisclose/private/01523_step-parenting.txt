I have a step-daughter in her late 20's that I've help raise since she was 3.    We were very close when she was younger.  She was my shadow.  My husband & I had full custody however her mother was (and still is) involved with her.  I encouraged her to have a relationship with her mother.  I never spoke ill of her mother yet around age 13, she turned against me.  I tried to get her to open up but nothing.  I chalked it up to teenage agnst thinking that as she got older, it would dissipate.  She is now age 27 and it has yet to be better.  She is nice to me when her Dad is around but rude as can be when he is not.  I have in the past let her know how her behaviour has been hurtful but it falls on deaf ears.  I feel as though she hates me and horribly, I am very uncomfortable around her.  For the past 4 years, I've not let her have the satisfaction of knowing how it still hurts me to the core because I feel it would fuel her actions.  I treat her the same as I always have.  At this point, I only put up with her because I adore her Father.  Sadly, if I were to tell my husband how she is or makes me feel, it would cause a rift between he and I.  And I don't want to put any damper on their excellent relationship).  My step-son, her older brother, adores me.  Does anyone have a suggestion on what else I can do other than continue on ignoring her ignorant behaviour towards me?  And for the record, her parents were divorced before I even met her Father.  I welcome any suggestions.  Thank you!
