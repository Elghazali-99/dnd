I am sorry if I'm writing long stories, but I hope you will read it because it made me feel good to pour out my feeling and. Thank you
 Me and my girlfriend have been dating for months. However, we have been known each other as friends for 3 years (yes, our relationahip is one of those take it slow kind of relationship)
 She is the type of girl who uphold "traditional" value as a woman. Never start calling boys first, always let the boys do the decision and just follow him. We always call ecery night til sleep, joking and laughing,  but never talk romantically because she isnt comfortable with that stuff. I hope you got the idea. 
 Our relationship is always make me do the first move, we never had sex (because our asian culture) even never kissed in public. But we kissed before butt not in public. 
 Today is her graduation ceremony and she's happy about it. We talked on the phone yesterday night about it. But I wasnt happy that I wasnt invited to one of her important event in her life. During her final exam struggle I was there for her support and comfort her. She even cried on the phone afraid of not passing the test. I was there with her listening to her cry all night. Never let go of my phone even once (except go to the toilet) 
 Now the rain has passed, why she didnt invite me to her graduation ceremony, one of her happiest day of her life. I'm sitting here confused, frustrated, and sad. I didnt know what to do thats why i'm writing right now. I hope you guys can tell me what I do wrong or hers? Thank you for your time reading.
