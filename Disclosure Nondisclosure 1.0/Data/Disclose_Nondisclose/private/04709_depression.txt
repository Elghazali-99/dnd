Hi All,
Just wanted to chime in here and share my story, if you are considering and antidepressant or SSRI, choose Zoloft or Prozac, because from what I read, getting off of them is much easier on the body because it leaves your system slower then with Paxil.
I've been taking Paxil 20mg for 12 years and felt that it was time to go off. So a month ago I went down to 10mg and I am now down to 5mg. Even tapering slow, I have had TERRIBLE withdrawal. I have had severe headaches and lightheadedness, and have felt very depressed, like I can just cry all day. My dreams have been crazy at night, I have been having a lot of nightmares that I wake up from. It has been awful and if I didn't exercise like I do, working out 6 days a week, I really feel like I'd be suicidal. 
Tomorrow I take my last 5mg. It is so terrible I have been tempted to go back to 20mg. But I am determined to get this evil crap out of my body. 
I just want everyone to know that they aren't alone and wanted to share my story. I am hoping to make it through this. I am told it might be 2 months of symptoms. UGH!!!!
