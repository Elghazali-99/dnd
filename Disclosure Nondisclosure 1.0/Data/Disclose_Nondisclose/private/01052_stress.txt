I'm 28 years old, my dad it's a very negative person, after he divorced he started to feel and express her feelings against her ex-wife in any time. He doesn't care if I'm with him, if I asked or not (I don't ask about that). 
 When he saids those things I can feel my face like "turning red" even if I don't see my self. The sensation is also like my brain strain and preasure on my brain ( is the way I feel when my father says those things). after a few mins this feeling goes away but my heart keep beating fast for some more minutes.
 First, sorry if I didn't explained in the best way but english it's not my mother language. I want to simplify some points before I could start hearing some suggestions and points of view about the "situation". My father is 60 years and he WON'T change the way he acts, on what he says, and how he feels (even if he makes me feels bad about it when he says it)
 I don't wan't to get sick of stress from my own father problems, I told him already that he talk all this and feelings with a phycotherapist and guess what he said...NO! :P .
 What can I do to relieve my self from those stress situations, I want to keep my mind clean of those things that only make or are going to make my body feel bad in a future. Which could be the best practice to avoid feeling like **** from a rancorous father for what happened on his life?
