Hi, On february 14th i got my period but it lasted for about 8 days (unusual). He said that he didnt penetrate and felt afterwards to make sure he didnt (dry sex). Then, on Feb. 18 or 19th my partner and i had dry sex, he was bare but i was on my period ( which lasted 8 days) i had on jeans silky underwear and a pad. Then at the end of February and beginning of March i had hard-ish fingering and had brown spots for 3 days then it stopped. my bleeding last for about 9 days which is unusual my periods usually last for about 5-6 days. In 2 weeks away from my period ( April 9 th) in the last week of march i had sharp pain once in the morning and maybe another in the afternoon, but it only happened for 2 days. This pasted week ive been having white or clear discharge about an inch or so long of liquid, to me its a bit excessive. Discharge would come everyday. Sometimes i would see 1-3 drops of it in my urine. I took 2 take-home pregnancy tests yesterday and got both negatives. My period is due today, but i didnt get it yet. I look at my stomach and i worked out for a little while and my stomach looks like its popping out a little but not sure if its just muscle i used to use when i did my crunches.  Could i be pregnant? and can pre- ejaculation/ *** go through clothes and cause pregnancy?
