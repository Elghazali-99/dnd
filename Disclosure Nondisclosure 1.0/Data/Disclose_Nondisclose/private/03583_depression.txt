For years I have cried myself to sleep, I don't know why, I lay in bed now thinking about why i cry, why I am angry, why I hate. I walk with a fake smile plastered to my face, my mask that fool everyone, I pretend to care and enjoy talking with people at work, when I really try to avoid social situations, I am also angry, I don't know, but I have a heightened sense of insensitivity. Example, I don't care for the news because I don't care what happens to the world, it's hard for me to feel sad for people when I hear stories of death or murder, I just don't care, I honestly sit and stew in anger at the tv, for any show, to the point my family doesn't really like me to watch with them because of my comments, I don't care for my future my past or what kind if life I am going to have, I do t know if I have an issue or if I'm just an ***, but I hurt 24/7, cry for no reason, and hate for no other reason than spite, I don't tell people my emotions because the more they know about me, the more they can tell, I don't even tell my family, even thought they wish I would, they know something's wrong, but can't push it because i am very defensive and pulled back, I don't know why I don't care, and have wondered about dying, but not to the point of trying, probably like most people,
  Do you ever just get that feeling where you don't want to talk to anybody.  You don't want to smile and you don't want to fake being happy but at the same time you don't know exactly what is wrong either?
That quote sums me up,,
