For the last couple of weeks I have been experiencing a very weird feeling in the right side of my head. It feels like someone has turned the bass up on a stereo really loud but there's no volume, and its a very quick "bump bump bump" feeling....sort of like a rumbling feeling not just near my ear but also above and in front of my right ear. Some days I don't feel anything at all, but other days it happens a lot. It usually only lasts for between 5 and 20 seconds, and it's not like an ear infection because I can move my head any which way and it won't cause anything to happen, and I don't feel dizzy although I do wake up with headaches often but I think they may just be sinus headaches. The weird feeling/sound occurs just out of the blue, when I'm laying down, when I'm at my desk on the computer, when I'm driving, etc. I went to my doctor last week about it who said he had no idea what it could be and suggested I just write down every time it happens and let him know if it improves. But it's really starting to worry me. 
 Also, one of the other things occuring before I went to the doctor was that I was having little tremors in different body parts, my right thigh, my arm, my lower stomach...it felt as though someone put a vibrating cellphone up against me (if that makes sense). My doctor said to keep note of when that happens too, and since the DR visit it's only happened maybe 3 or 4 times total, but the thing in my head happened the day before yesterday and it was on and off all day long, at least 50-60 times (i kept a tally of when it happened). It doesn't totally mess up my concentration however it still really worries me, as it just doesn't seem like this should be happening. 
 I posted this in the ear/nose/throat forum, but a friend of mine told me that I could be experiencing symptoms of a brain tumor so I thought I would post it here to.  Does anyone have any ideas of what this could be?
 Thank you
