I'm so angry right now.  I've been trying to have my kids 8 and 6 keep their room clean and nothing has worked!  Every time I go in there it's like a tornado has gone through it.  I've taken all their tows away.  I've cleaned it for them, I've grounded them, I've yelled, I've spanked.  Nothing works, and every attempt I've made to have them clean their room usually takes days of me sending them back in there over and over again until finally it's clean.  Then the next day or the day after, it's a HUGE mess again.  I've found that they just throw stuff in the closet, or clothes in the toy box.  My daughter takes everything out of her drawers and throws it on the floor resulting in me having to do tons of laundry.  I'm so sick of this, I just want to throw all their toys and clothes away.  They don't listen to me, and when their supposed to be cleaning and i go check on them, their usually playing.  Nothing I do works, I'm at my wits end, and starting to think I'll never be able make them keep their room clean.  I get so angry, so fast I just want to explode.  I try closing my eyes, and breathing deep, but it doesn't work, a few minutes later I'm on RED again.  What can I do with these messy little kids?
