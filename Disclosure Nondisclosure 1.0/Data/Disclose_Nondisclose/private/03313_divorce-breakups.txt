My husband has recently left me, because he was simply no longer "happy." He walked out of the door after 17 years, and 3 daughters later. My gut had been telling me the past year that there was someone else, but of course when I called him out, the answer was always NO. After he left in Sept 2012, he came back on Thanksgiving Day and opened up to me about the affair, that I knew was going on in the back of my mind. I choose to forgive, and over the past few weeks things have been great, we shared so many laughs, smiles, hand holding, even sex. He told her that he wanted to work on his family, then surprise .... she shows up pregnant. So, he leaves again, because now he thinks he has screwed everyone's life up. After he leaves me, a week later ..... she has a miscarriage. I had chosen the original path of forgiveness for his infidelity, and still choose to do so. His mother keeps telling me he is going through a midlife crisis, and that we all can't give up on him. I am choosing to move on with making priority #1 and then helping my daughters pick up the pieces. I see a lot of posts of women going through the same thing, but I am not hearing any of the updates. Can someone please give me a six month or year update. I want to hear stories that everyone makes it through and husband & wife find a new love with each other. Or wife gets through it finds love in the last place she was looking. Not that I want to hurry up for any resolution, but it is important to me to hear the "everly after" part, not just the bitterness now.
