Last December I realized my husband was having an affair.  All I could think about is how undesirable I am.  It must be all my fault.  I tried to kill myself, you see he is not the first man to turn to another woman.  As you all can tell, I am still alive and coping with this situations.  Well, my husband denied the affair even though I had concrete proof.  He was planning a trip to see his mother and the day before he left, I told him that when he returned he would be telling me he was leaving. that was march 4th.  he came home on march 7th and he did announce he was going to live with his mother.  Well to make a long story short, he is still in the area and living with his *****.  He is trying to keep me on the line, but i will not let that happen.  I am just having problems with dealing with the loneliness.  I allowed my husband, by the way he is a raging idiot, chase all my friends away.  I have no one to really turn to accept my adult daughter.  I do not want to turn to another man.  I need to get over this breakup first.  I live in a small town and want to move, so maybe I will find new friends when I move.  thanks for listening.
