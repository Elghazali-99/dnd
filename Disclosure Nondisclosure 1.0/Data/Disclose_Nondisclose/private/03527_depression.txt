I was diagnosed with depression during the summer of 2012. I take pills and it is not helping much. I don't know what to do. But I don't think that's the problem right now. My problem is that ever since I was 12 (I'm 15 now) I've been daydreaming nonstop. I make up situations and stories in my head all the time. In class, when I'm shopping, when I take a shower, and especially when I listen to music. The stories are always different but they're mostly romantic and about friends. It's about a live I wish I had. It doesn't sound bad, but it is. It's just extreme daydreaming. I do it whenever I can. I have OCD and I got this idea in my head that if I keep daydreaming none of those things will happen to me. It scared me so for this week, I've tried not to daydream. The problem is that it makes me even more depressed. I feel like I should daydream, but I'm scared of it. I want to live my life and live the life I want to and my ocd tells me if I keep daydreaming, something like the stories in my head won't happen to me in real life. What is this? I need help! Please! It's taking over my life.
