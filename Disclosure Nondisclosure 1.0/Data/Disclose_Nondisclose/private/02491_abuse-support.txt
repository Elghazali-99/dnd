Well, I am new to this community and I have been thinking about posting but I hadn't yet. I was observing, but I guess I am ready to post now.  I am 22 and I have had a very rough 22 years and things just don't want to get  any better it seems and lately its like my past has been haunting me...I was molested when I was younger (8-9). The guy who did it was my older cousin(19). I have also been through some pretty rough relationships with guys including verbal abuse, emotional abuse, physical abuse, and rape a few times. I have really bad trust issues with it and I don't know how to get over  that. I want to trust but I can't its hard. Also it interfere with sex...I know I shouldn't be having sex outside of marriage but its like sometimes I can't help wanting to have sex just to remind me that there are almost good guys out there, but when I get ready to have sex i always get nervous before and I tense up and during sex its like am not completely there in mind just in body...and sometimes i feel very violated after sex or even worse...I am just numb... I don't know what to do at all......I feel like I am only good enough for bad guys and sex will never be good for me and the feeling of violation will never go away...What do i do?
