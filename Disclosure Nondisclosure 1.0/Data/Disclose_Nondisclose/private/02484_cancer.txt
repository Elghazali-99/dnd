I went to the doctor complaining of excessive facial hair which has gradually gotten worse over the last couple of years. I also haven't been able to get pregnant over the last 3 years, and have been to the doctor several times for abdominal pains on my right side that make walking unbearable, but they do an xray and say it's ntohing. Once or twice I was told that I had a uterine cyst that burst, but otherwise they told me it was normal.
 I went to the doctor more recently because the hair has been getting worse, even on my breasts and chest and my pubic hair grows really fast, so much that I have to wax/shave every other or every 2 days.
 She did several tests and found I had elevated DHEAS levels near the 600s but normal testosterone, though my 17-0H progesterone was low (10) as well as FSH levels (which were at 3 a week before my period was due (which is irregular alternating between 30-35 day cycles) and LH which was at 15. I went for a CT scan and he said my adrenal gland was abnormal.
 My question is, does an abnormality necessarily mean a tumor, or can it just mean it's larger than normal or something else?
 Also, if it is a tumor, and it is functioning, does that mean cancer? Or does it just mean a functioning tumor? What is the difference. I am scheduled for an MRI. 
 I was looking at Cushings, but it doesn't seem like me, because my cortisol was normal (even towards the low end) and I don't have acne, a hump, or moon face, and my blood pressure is excellent, actually a bit low -- though I've always gained weight in my abdomen before everywhere else, and I'm naturally muscular and athletic. 
 I have been hypoglycemic at times. I also have been told my white blood cell count is high and I am somewhat anemic. I don't know what's wrong, but could all of these things be related to the adrenal gland?
