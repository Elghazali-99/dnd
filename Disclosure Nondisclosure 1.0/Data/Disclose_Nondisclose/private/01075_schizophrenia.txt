I was happy where i was . I used to hate poetry, poems. I used to have allergy with poems from childhood. Suddenly i became so much crazy poet. I started to love without picture from chat. I was technically by long range so ******* crazy made that i met the bloodiest mother ****** witch a bloodiest creature (an illusion) though i had no home address, no phone number, no money. Such a ******* love happened nonsense without picture, so far, unimaginable. I met that bloody creature because i was made crazy technically., Which in real life naturally never happens. Coming in sydeny billion times death happened and at the end medicine is life timer. It's just an illusion that one day i will be get rid of medicine. impossible thing. But after some months and years i will be same ill and sick that i was in the past because i cant buy such an expensive medicine. Just waste of time and only suffer. I wish to take medicine aslo i cant means after 1 year i will be exactly sick that i was before. The bloodiest mother ****** pulled using long range  laser. Now i wish to write poem also i cant write what the **** is poetry. how to write poem. now well but again huge huge mountain willl appear . same. worst thing. if i was rich and done this i will be thankful , but whats the meaning for doing to them who cant buy.
