I've been through a lot in the past few years, and I believe it has taken a toll on my mental health. If I do one little thing stupid, like if I'm running late for something I'll constantly remind myself after and tell myself how stupid I am and I should kill myself. I have considered it many times, suicide. Only attempted it once though. I believe I had a mental break down of some sort on the night I attempted suicide. I was crying and laughing hysterically and just spazzing out over nothing in particular. And I tired to end my life. Luckily, the scissors just bruised me. I keep wondering if I would of been better of if I really did die. I keep these sort of things to myself usually, because some people can be really judgemental. But lately this has gotten really bad and I constantly just want to cry and kill myself and I hate it. It like there an evil side to me that hates my guts. Depression and anxiety runs through my family, but I've never had the guts to talk about this to anyone. Could someone please help me I don't know what to do anymore. I've seen phycologists and neuropsychologists and all sorts of things, but I've never been able to open up. I feel like nobody knows me. I feel, to be frank, pretty ****. I'm only 15, I know I have a whole life ahead of me, but I just... Don't see the point. Please help. Thanks.
