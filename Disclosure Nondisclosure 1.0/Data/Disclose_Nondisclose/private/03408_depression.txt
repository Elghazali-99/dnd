I graduated high school 4 years ago and I have not done much since then. I only work a part-time dead-end job and I extremely lack motivation and confidence. I appear lazy to many people as I don't do much physical activities. I sit on my computer all day whenever possible (not working) and don't want to do anything else. I almost never feel happy or excited but at the same time I'm not sad. I feel angry more than anything. Angry at myself for being like this. Thoughts of suicide happen from time to time because I feel like what's the point in living when I'm not achieving anything. I never give it any "serious" thought though, just pops up in my head from time to time. I have no real social life also. 
 I also have problems with memory. I had to bring my relative with me to therapy because I couldn't recount much of my childhood or even recent history. Yes, I did go to a counselor but feel like I haven't gotten any help at all. My GP even brushed me off and said I need to just get out of my room.
 So basically my symptoms are: lack of motivation/energy/drive, social isolation, headaches, body aches, low sex drive, minor thoughts of suicide, memory problems, brain fog.
 I don't know what's wrong with me but I am so darn frustrated I don't know what to do. My GP gave me a physical and said everything came out fine. I am so confused and helpless. Do I have depression, another mental illness or could it be a physical illness undetected by my doctor?
