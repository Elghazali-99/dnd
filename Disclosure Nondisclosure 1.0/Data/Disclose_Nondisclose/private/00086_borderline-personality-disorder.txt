I have been living with my wife for 12 years. She was very sweet and wanted to make me as happy as possible.. At the slightest disagreement, she would rage or cry or hurt herself.. Then she would not talk with me for days or even weeks. She would falsely accuse me of things that I did not do and would campaign against me to friends and family. At the end it would always be that I am insensitive and she loves me so much that she cannot live without me. I discovered a defense systems where we both separated things as much as possible and avoided disagreements.. but we set us apart so much that she started to have affair [most of them were unknown to me]. She had 6 or 7 suicidal attempts. Long time back a therapist told us about BPD and how it may be causing problem in our marraige. Her previous affairs were with nice people and somehow got unnoticed from me. She is having an affair with a pyshopath.. She worships the psychopath.  She does whatever the psychopath wants her to do. If psychopath humiliates her with a bad word..she would repeat that word [at another time] to humiliate her. Things are so hurtful you cannot even imagine. Sexual perversion [sadism] and controlling is just a part of what might have started as an emotional affair. They are denying everything and campaigning against me as much as possible. I am afraid about my 8 year old daughter [this psychopath's sexual craving and variety does not know any age limit. He goes with someone as old as his mother's age to very younger girls]. I heard so many abnormal sexual things about him [many of them from ny wife]. I have no proofs of my wife's abuse, suicidal attempts, affairs, how she ignored my daughter the most of last 8 years. I donot know how to protect my daughter. Help.. I dont even know whether her therapist diagnosed her BPD, because she knows about the disease and the symptoms and the psychopath is directing her on how to fool the therapist..
