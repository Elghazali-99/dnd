My doctor said I am estrogen dominant, thyroid issues and adrenal fatigue so she has me on estrogen cream, progesterone cream, DHEA, pregnenelone and some supplement for my adrenals.  I am 58 and post menopausal.  In the past year I have gained two sizes in clothes and 25 pounds.  I have been on bio-identical hormones in various amounts for 5 years now and being post menopausal I think I don't need them anymore.  They helped my hot flashes and night sweats.  My doctor doesn't want me to do anything strenuous like spinning which I did a lot of several years ago and I was in good shape, because of adrenal fatigue.  So I have been trying to walk 10,000 steps a day but I tire easily when exercising and am really depressed from being overweight.  I used to be a fitness instructor up till I was 40 and was alway fit and muscular.  Now I can't build any muscle or tone up.  Waking just isn't getting it!  I'm wondering if I ween myself off of all this crap if I will drop this weight?
