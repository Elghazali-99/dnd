Hello,
About 7 years ago, my dad left my mom and my siblings and I. We thought he was kidnapped/dead. Police couldn't find anthing on him for like 9 months. Then one day he calls his mother (my grandma) that he is guilty of something. Which was him cheating on my mom. He hung up and a year later he calls my mom asking if he could come back. Which she did... it was really akward, and to be honest, when I think about it I become depressed. So he was gone for a total of 2 years of my preteen years.
     
    It seems like now (today) the same situation is happening again... my mom found some cell phone that she has never seen before, and ask where he got it, he replied angrily that he found it. They got in a huge argument, and ended up dropping my mom and my sis and some store with no ride back home... now we beginning to feel like he's cheating again, but we don't know? We don't know where he's at, and don't know what we should do if he comes back. What do you think of this?Since my parents got back together all they do was ever fight, they don't even sleep in the same bed anymore since that incident 7 years ago, or kiss. I wish they would get a divorce I know that sounds messed up, but I think everyone would be better off. I'm 20 now btw. I'm depressed and angry... Thank you!
