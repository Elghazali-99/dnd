So on August 11th the doctor told me I was 7 weeks and 1 day pregnant. My period is 30 days long I think? 
 THESE ARE MY PAST 2 PERIODS: 
 MAY 8TH 2013 
JUNE 8TH 2013 
 I am 29 weeks and 2 days pregnant today! My boyfriend fingered me and i'm not sure if there was pre c u m but if there was it was a little? and this was on JUNE 23 BUT WE DID NOT HAVE SEX. I had unprotected sex and he came inside me on JUNE 29TH and JULY 5TH. My next period would of been July 9th or something i'm not sure entirely? 
 My EDD IS March 30th and still is... My question here is when would I have conceived around? I know nobody knows for sure but an educated guess would be very helpful. I am so lost! 
 I have tried doing the reverse calender things and I plugged my due date ( march 30th) into it and it says I conceived around July 6th which is cool whatever but it doesnt make sense because of my lmp. I also plugged in when I first found out I was pregnant ( AUG 11 when I was 7 weeks and 1 day) and it still says July 6th or 7th so im very lost here because they dont match my lmp did I ovulate late or something possibly?
