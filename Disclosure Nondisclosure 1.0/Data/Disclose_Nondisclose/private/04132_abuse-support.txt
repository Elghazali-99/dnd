Ok, so a few years ago i was abused by a man. Im a 20 years old male. And so I never told my parents about the incident... and i kept it a secret. I know, stupid. But i didnt want to put my parents into an emotional crisis. Although I lived through it, and yeah... i had all the feelings and all the emotional reck happened to me... such as drugs, and alcohol, poor school grades, etc. So I searched for help, i cursed him, and started to live a new life. So anwyays, now im near this guys family.... and i cant stand being surrounded by them, and I have to keep friendships with them cuz my parents are really good friends with them, so now i dont know what i need to do! I made it a secret, and now.... i cant breathe. Im turmanted. And i dont want to be around these people, but its so important to my parents. Im screwed. I dont talk when around them... i get distant around them, and i start to rethink what happened! You know, what i really would like to do is to get the evil out of me, and screw this mans life like never before. I would like to seriously make him suffer. But i dont think i really want to get my evil out. I think it would be stuff.. and im scared of karma. I dont know, as much as i would want to, i dont think ill do it. Yeah,... like i kinda do know i have to be away from these people, so i get better. but i have to be ok when im around these people. They had nothing to do with it, so why would i want to make everyone suffer and feel bad about it? Just because that happened? I know it wassent my fault what that retard did what he did to me. I have an empty, and when im around these people, well, i want to vomit, and run away. But i dont know how to do it, I would love to see this man one day, and hit him so bad with something, make all his teeth fall! Please guys, I dont know what i need to do? Im confused, and my heart is breaking down!  How can i let others come in, if i cant let go of what happened to me? It makes me so sad!
