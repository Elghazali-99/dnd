is it time to separate?  everytime he does something wrong, my intolerence is the problem.... If I am in a bad mood about something not even related to him, he makes it about him and then tells me I am crazy... and pushes my buttons further... he never agrees or supports my views on things that are not favorable, and all problems with everyone are my fault regardless of the situation....  when I need his help he fights me and is stubborn and makes me fight for it, but when someone else wants help he jumps, the skys the limit....  I can't ever have a productive conversation to air my grievences he always deflects and turns it around on me, but he has no problem telling me his dislikes and I usually make the adjustments, but he will not... he has a drinking problem and  I personally can not tolerate alchol, I have a chemical intolerence to it, and when I do drink and it has a negative effect on me, he leaves me and says he fears for his safety, yet he continues to drink daily, some days are ok, others he get sloppy drunk, I have begged him to stop but instead he drinks more...
