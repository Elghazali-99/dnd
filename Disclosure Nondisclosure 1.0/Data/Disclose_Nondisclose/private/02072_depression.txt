Hi there
 To whoever will read this I am in desperate need of help I have been going through hell, I have been paranoid I have contracted an std through risky sexual behaviour and can't live with what might have happened. I have a wife and baby and am totally scared of losing them. I think I have an addiction to sex or some sort of compulsive behaviour as I try to stop but find it really difficult to stop. I have been tested for stds but have never had a positive result for anything but have ongoing symptoms of anal pain and have had lumps there I am really scared I have anal cancer that have been misdiagnosed as hamerroids. I have a colonoscopy in a few weeks and scared I will lose my family if the results come back as an std, I can't sleep have incredible joint pain, I have never been sucidal but have been researching it on google I'm scared I don't know what to do I am so alone and feel terrible about what I have done to my family I am also dealing with this by myself and have only told my councillor can someone help me
