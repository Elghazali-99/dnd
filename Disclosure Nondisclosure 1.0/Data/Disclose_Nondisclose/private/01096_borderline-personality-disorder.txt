Ok so yesterday my therapist told me that she believes that i have dependent personlity disorder. I agree with her. I know what i have to do to help myself but im so scared. I have to move out from my boyfriends and live alone. He's really an *** hole so that part of me wants to leave but then again sometimes i feel like im the problem. I asked him today if hes noticed any changes in me and he said hardly nothing. All he said was you dont go thru my stuff anymore. That hurt because I feel that I have changed dramitically. I spend too much energy and time on this relationship and i am tired and drained. But i am sooo scared to leave. Its weird i dont know how to explain it. I get anxiety attacks and start flipping out. I really do just want to be alone. Im afraid that i will get out of this one and just go into another relationship that might be even worse. And sometimes I start to think ok this relationship aient that bad maybe its juss me. But the more i talk to other ppl who know him the more i feel i should walk out. I also have three kids and im scared to be on my own with them and im afraid that i might drop out of school so i can support them..I dont know anymore...My sis in law said i could move with her but she lives far i have everything over here and my son is so exicited hes going to start middle school with all his friends and i dont want to keep moving my kids. I always get into stupid messed up relationships and leave only to find myself in the same situation again. any words of advice???
