So first off i'd like to state that i have graves disease' and i get the really bad mood swings. For the past 2 years i've been getting angry and frustrated over the littlest things' sometimes i get so angry i break things, punch walls, bang my head on the wall or physically hurt myself. I can't really say what triggers my anger because, even little things people say make me snap; i get frustrated if i can't do something, i'm the worst when people accuse me of something or accuse me of lieing. also i've been with my boyfriend for about a year, and when i get angry ,i take it out on him, i swear and abuse him. I feel so bad after it happens but at the time i just can't calm down. I hate feeling this way, and i don't no what to do. I'm only 15 so this is all really hard when trying to calm down at school, sometimes ill get angry if someone looks at me the wrong way, i know my brother has adhd, or something like that. I just want to know if there is something wrong with me or if there is anything i can do to keep me from getting violent. Please help. xox
