Hi,
 I haven't been diagnosed with BPD, but I recognise a lot of the characteristics in myself. I feel empty, like something is missing. I hit and scratch myself when I feel bad. I love my mother very much, but lash out at her when she does something that I don't like. I also become very angry when she goes somewhere without me. Some days I will be mad at her, then after the anger has subsided, I'll have no idea why I was angry in the first place. 
Most days, I'll eat to the point of making myself ill. I just can't stop. Some days I just feel as though I can't control anything, which upsets me because I feel as though I need to be in control; of everything, what others do and say, as well as myself. 
Sometimes, everything gets too much and I just think it would be easier to end it all. I sometimes take more than my prescribed amount of anti-depressants, just to see what would happen; I'm not really sure if I want to take too many or not. 
 However, I have good days, where I can keep most things under control. Sometimes, the good days last for a week or so, before the bad ones come along again. 
 No matter what I do, I still feel the emptiness.
 I am wondering whether people who are diagnosed with BPD have the same fluctuations or behaviours as I do? I just need some guidance and help... I'm not sure what to do.
