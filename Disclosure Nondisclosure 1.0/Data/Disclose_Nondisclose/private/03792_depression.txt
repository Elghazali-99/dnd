just background info, my ex bf told MW he thinks about committing suicide a lot. I am the only one he has confided in and didn't know how yo handle that but ultimately told his mom.
  update: we are currently back together working on things. but since we started talking about our relationship again, he has cried to me at least 2 times everyday. today is Monday so since about last Thursday. he cries about still feeling like he just wants to end his life. he feels like he has no reason to be here. as if no one would miss him or even care. he's put me through a lot in the past 5 years together and he fears that because of our past that I'm just gonna give up on him. he's been different since we started even talking again. and I see that but he still worries. I even reminded him that he has a brand new nephew who he wouldn't be able to see grow if he were to do such a thing as take his own life. his response was its ok, he'll never remember me. he does say that the fact that we're giving us another shot helps though. the fact that he can talk to me and I'm nothing but supportive and suck that it helps too. 
 idk. I just really need some advice. idk what to do. he refuses to get help. or at least right now. but what should I do. I've already told his mom. what more can I do?
