ok so heres my thing. My girlfriend and I broke up about 5 months ago. We have a 11 month old baby. after we broke up we were stilling seeing each other and messing around and getting along great again but then mothers day she wanted me to go to brunch with her and her family but i decided to go to my game instead which caused us to fight. then 3 weeks went passed with barley talking and i decided to go to her house and apologize and to try to work things out but she told me she was seeing someone. i tried to get her back for months after this and rcently i kind of just gave up and havent seen her in a month. my mother has been picking the baby up for me so i dont have to see her. for some reason she thinks i have a gf now and she keeps making comments about me being with my gf. shes the one that is seeing someone else and yet is concerned about me having a gf which i dont get. anyway i guess my question is will it actually work with this dude seeing she was trying to get me back a week before she started talking to this guy and is it worth trying to get her back again? i love her and my baby and all i want is to have our family back together. well thanks for your time
