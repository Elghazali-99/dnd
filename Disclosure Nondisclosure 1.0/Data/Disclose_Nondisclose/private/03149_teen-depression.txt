I have tried to get her to get help. I have tried everything from calling her school about the school counslor to calling aware, a counsling service. As far as I know, i am the only one who knows about her issues. I am the only one she trusts and tells things. She has told me this before. And another thing, i dont live in the same town as her. I live in Helena montana, and she lives in Butte Montana, a whole 65 miles away from eachother. I talk to her on the phone or through text messages to check up on her. She never has a day where she is happy. Is there a name or a disorder that brings up these signs? Is it just severe depression or something far more serious. I have never heard of any body doing the things she does. She also had serious anger problems. If anybody makes her angry, like play hit her and it happens to cause pain, she will react in impulse and black out and get very angry. I don't really know how i can help her when i am miles away. She refuses help, she denys that she has problems, and her eating disorder has just completely ate away her body and sucked the color out of her skin. She use to have a really good skin color, she is german, so it was kind of darkish and whitish all together, now, she is whiter than paper. Any more suggestons?
