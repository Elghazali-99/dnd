I married the guy I am with for 3 years. I am six months pregnant now and the first few months of our marriage has not been easy. I know we love each other but I get tired of dealing with him when he becomes insecure and complains about his job. What do I do? I kinda made him see that I am tired and I don't want to deal with is dramas so he is staying with his sister now. I miss him when I come home and he is not there, but I want to make him realize my absence in his life and hope to think about what is going on and what will really make him happy. I told him I won't hold him back if he is not happy anymore, but I guess he just wants full attention out of me. What do I do? I just want us to live separately right now instead of us arguing all the time. And it hurts me that when I expect to see him when I wake up, he is not there cause he's gone to his mom or his sister. (Im sure it is not another woman because I go there myself to check on him) so I just made him see that Im okey even we are not physically together. I dont text or call him. We have done this before and its either I or him who gives up and starts calling again and says wants to see the other. But I am holding my grounds, I am not doing anything right now to call or get in touch with him because I did not do anything wrong...I just want to know what to do. Do I need to let go? Or just live my life right now away from him? Im just tired of trying to fix things in this relationship.. Help please.
