Hey guys, 19 year old male here just turning 20.  Ripe age for the onset of schizophrenia, whaddya know...
 Lately I've been really stressed out about whether I have schizophrenia or not.  Currently, the symptoms I'm experiencing are mild (but what would I really have to compare them to? idk).  Thing is I think about them more than they occur.  I'm constantly dwelling on them and I think that causes them to occur in greater frequency.
 Anyway, I've been seeing things in my periphery and I'll think it's a bug or something moving.  I'll turn my head in that direction and it's just some inanimate object or a mark on the wall (my brother left a lot of scuffs in the room from putting up posters and things).  The real scary one is this gnat I'll see sometimes at night that I'm not really sure is real or not, this one isn't in the periphery either it'll float right in front of my face.  It drove me to tears a few days ago when I confessed to my parents what I've been going through.
 Really though no other symptoms are manifesting themselves, I'm not hearing voices or thinking I'm God or receiving personal messages or anything.  Just the weird periphery thing.  I have this nagging feeling that if I keep dwelling on this, things will just get worse and I'm really scared already that I'm some paranoid schiz.  I probably spend too much time alone with my thoughts and am working myself up, but I would just like some input.  Do you think I'm going crazy?  =/
