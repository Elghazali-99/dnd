I don't know what to do anymore??  I have realized I actually married a psycho and worse off i have a baby with him.  I wish I could leave with my baby but i'm scared that he will end up with him cause be makes more money (even though that doesn't really matter) and he and his psycho family will fight me and my family until our dying last breath.  I know so many women leave and get through it but these people are CRAZY. I really screwed up and have been living this nightmare for almost a year now and i say that we have to make it work for the baby but it's toooo hard.  He doesn't let me enjoy our baby meaning I want to be able to go out with the baby ALONE and not him having to come also. I am dying to stay a couple nights at my mom's place with the baby cause that's what normal people/family and it's soo tiring taking care of baby's especially with what's going on i'm soo tired and frustrated and i don't know how i'm going on but the psycho will not allow that because he says my parents house is full and he said that they already have 5 grandchildren and his parents only have our child. WHAT ARE U KIDDING ME?? That's crazy !!  It breaks my heart that my parents don't see the baby as often and in a year we only go there only couple times a month. He says they can come over to our place ...well they do but i wanna go how often i want!!!
