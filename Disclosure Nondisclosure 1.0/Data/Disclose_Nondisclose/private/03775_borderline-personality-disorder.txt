My son is 32, and he works off and on until someone "insults" him by saying he is too quiet, or until he gets sick of the job for some other reason and then he quits. I have been paying his rent for years. I am out of money, his dad is laid off, and I feel he has to get a job and stick with it. He was diagnosed with Schizotypal personality disorder, but his two brothers are Bipolar I and II, so really I am not sure about the diagnosis. He won't go to therapy long enough to find out if the diagnosis is correct, nor will he take medicine. He is very intelligent, quit college right before he was to get a degree in math. Right now, he wants to move in our tiny apt with us. However it didn't work before, because he said he couldn't work while living with us, that we "weakened" him psychologically.He owes student loans and needs to make money, but he has certain conditions for getting jobs, like he thinks he is above getting a regular ten dollar/hour job, and he doesn't want to stand all day being a teller or some such job. What do you do? My therapist says to cut off the rent money and let him hit rock bottom so he wakes up, but honestly we tried it for a week and he lived at the train station. What do you do?
