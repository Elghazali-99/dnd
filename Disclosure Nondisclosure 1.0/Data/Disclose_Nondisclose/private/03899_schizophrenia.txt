Well i am thinking about future, I am disable to find seroquel xr in Nepal and India. I found only generic but it does not work for me. Well it has been said that those who have diabetes there is a huge chances of depression. Doctor has kept secret they say mental illness only. But they  even said that if this medicine didn't work , you will have diabities. My problem is i m going to be disable in my country cause i need insuline but i have no proof do i have a diabities or not? But my body demands poision nuterlizer . Can a mental  ppl take insulin injections? Well my body is healthy but to keep my body healthy i need to eat medicines. There is animal mixed in seroquel. I pay $500 for seroquel xr and the generic one is only 45 dollar for 60 days. It's a huge price difference. Can i take anti psycotic medicine as well as insuline injections? If not wave will break my hand and legs it's dangerous cause i have already experienced . i have already tried lots of medicine. Why doctor lie and don't say clearly that i had a diabetes? I am in trouble now.
