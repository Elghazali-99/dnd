hi guys .. i need some uplifting advice or nething that will keep me going about my days ... almost a year ago i went through a period of my life in which i was extremely depressed and it sucked .. i feel ten times better now than i had before but lately ive been feeling stressed with many things .. one of my biggest fear is death and cancer .. maybe because someone i went to school with had passed away with cancer nd i just keep hearing stories about that word .. idk how to control my emotions .. sometimes i get so scared that ill almost have a panic attack for no reason .. its like i have no reason to be feeling this way .. i have no fam. history of nething and ive always been healthy and pretty active in my life .. im just scared it could happen to me which is way out of the line u kno .. sometimes i look at other people and wonder .. wow they are so happy and chill with their lives why cant i be the same way? .. i feel like ive progressed so much and im much more happier then i was a year ago and i dont want to fall back in that slump .. i kno im better then that and life happens the way it does .. im a religious person and i pray everyday and believe in God and that everything happens for a reason and that no matter what im protected and will be throughout my life .. im sorry if im saying too much then i should .. but websites like this is made to help people and get feedback on other ppls opinions .. alrite i think i feel a little better that i let some of this out .. because topics like this is always hard to talk to anybody i know bcuz i feel like no one would understand where im coming from and think im crazy .. if u read this whole thing thankyou .. it makes me feel like ppl out there do care about feelings and emotions ..
