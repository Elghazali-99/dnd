My boyfriend has anger outburts when he drinks.  I am not sure if he has a drinking problem or a problem when he drinks.  He gets black out drunk and goes into a rage.  He starts yelling and throwing things and hitting things.  This has happened about 5 times over the past year, each time getting worse.  The last time he got physical with me.  The next day is always the same thing.  He is so sorry, he didn't mean it, he doesn't remember what happened the night before.  Aside from all this he is a wonderful boyfriend.  Very loving, sweet, caring, giving, the whole nine yards.  After this last outburst he agreed to go to an anger management class.  I want him to go to therapy and he thinks that I am over reacting, and he thinks that he doesn't really have a problem as long as he monitors his drinking.  I am afraid that he is just going through the motions of anger management to make me happy and it won't actually work.  I also think that he needs therapy because he continues to drink and I don't trust that he will keep it monitored and realize his stopping point. I am supposed to move home with him in a few months when he gets out of the military and I am afraid if I go that this will continue and get worse.  What should I do to make him understand that he needs therapy before this escalades into something horrible? Or am I over reacting?
