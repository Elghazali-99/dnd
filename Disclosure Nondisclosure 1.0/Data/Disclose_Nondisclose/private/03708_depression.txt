So about two months ago I got vertigo. It wasn't because of labyrinthitis (I've had that before, years ago) but because, according to my doctor, a very strict (carbs free) diet I have been doing. He gave me a couple of shots and prescribed me some meds. That cured it all. I feel like it is now slowly coming back though, and I am so afraid because I had never felt so sick in my life as I did two months ago. It took me like two weeks to recuperate. I'm having many of the initial symptoms: headache, a bit of dizziness and nausea, but most of all this feeling that my eyes sort of "dance" for a second. It's like they shift quickly from one side to the other in a quick, involuntary motion, and I can hear this whoosh sound when it happens. I am so afraid to go to sleep because I don't want to wake up feeling worse.
 Looking through this site I came across some people having gone through something similar, and I found that some of them had been on antidepressants but quit cold turkey, which is why they started having these symptoms. I'm also depressive and have been on Luvox for over two years (been on many, many different depressants for many years) yet I suddenly quit cold turkey two months ago. This was because of the vertigo, I didn't want to be taking so many meds and just quit the Luvox. I am wondering though if this could be the Vertigo again or the Luvox withdrawal. Would it help if I went back on Luvox again?
