I am a step-father of three good kids and husband to wonderful woman.                                             Married for only a short time now and it seems our ideas seem to clash now as to a few things.             We recently spoke about saving for a home that we would purchase in the next 2-3 years; I ask that a small portion of the child support be saved as well as portions of our own money. At first  this plan was well received, then a few months later my wife didn’t want to follow that plan, stating we should save just our own money not any of the child support. At first I felt betrayed and wondered would all our agreed upon plans be subject to sudden change at her whim, or could it be that she felt that child support should not be on the table. So now I’m wondering am I hill for asking, I just felt as though sense there three kid in the house that would not be out anytime soon, that it should be a part of our finances. When we married it wasn’t an issue it seem it has become one, one that I really wish wouldn’t be. I don’t want to be perceived as the guy taking from the kids. My son is grown and has been out my house sense before I married so it was just me. Now with a wife and three new kids, I’m wondering where to draw my lines, and with income tax season coming, I find myself asking how that’s going to work.
