This has been bugging me for a while.  Is there a birth defect that causes a baby to be born with like two sets of legs like >--< where their upper torso is instead just another bottom torso and would the hospitals even let the parents take this kid out because as I imagine the kid is going to probably not survive or possibly even be a stillborn because they have no way of consuming things like air and food and liquids or is this not a possible situation?  I saw this when I was a kid where two parents had a kid in a swing at a park like that except it looked like it wasn't a newborn and had grown quite a bit, which again, I don't know how it would even be alive and it had a diaper on each pair of legs.  The swing it was in was like a harness which is how it didn't fall off and it didn't move.  When we went to leave the park the parents stopped moving and made the kid stop swinging from them pushing it and glared at me in the most disturbing and surreal yet blank and emotionless way that felt like it was piercing my soul which scared me too much to ask my great grandpa, who I was with to even look over at them to see it.  I haven't seen anyone ever again have such a look on their face.  He ended up not even looking in that direction at all that I can remember and when we got out of hearing distance he said he never saw them.
