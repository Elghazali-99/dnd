I have been depressed for as long as I can remember. When I was younger, I was abused, messed with, and neglected by my father. Ever since then, I've had this hatred (more like a fear) towards men. Everyday at school, I'm all alone. I sit by myself, I have no friends. I don't mean to push them away but they tell me that they don't want to hang out with somebody who bums them out all the time. In October, my best friend (the only one I ever loved so much) killed himself because he was being bullied. I was torn... I didn't know what to do. I cry every day, I've tried to kill myself before, and I wound up in a psychiatric hospital. Everybody at school found out and now I hear al  these remarks like "Don't make her upset, she'll swallow a whole bottle of pills again." Or "Do you see her scars, what an emo." Those don't really bother me that much, but they still have a little bit of an effect. The thing that really hurts me is that I constantly get emails saying "just kill yourself, nobody will miss you. Every body hates you. Just die already" I started cutting. People call me fat, I started throwing up. And here I am, 80 pounds and five foot one. I constantly have panic attacks when I'm at school, I'm lost. I'm not safe, hated, and I need help. I need advice on how to handle my depression and deal with the bullying....
