I am stressed over this dream I had last night. So I had a dream where I died, My sister poisened me and my dad. Then I was in my house but dead. And everyone else was there I guess they died too. I was in the middle of heaven or something. I then cried to my mom telling her that I wanted to see God and go to Heaven and meet him and be safe. Then we started saying things about my mom. Kind've like at a funeral. I got up and was saying some stuff about my mom. Then I woke up. Well it first started with me at my neighbors house. My sister came later and asked if I wanted a drink. I saw her crush up a pill and put it in one of the drinks. But I thought it was for her. She has done weed before. Then I went home, went to bed, then I woke up dead. My mom was already dead for someone reason I don't know. She was just already dead in the dream. And when I woke up dead my dad was their. He said that my sister had poisoned him and me too. I had also kept asking my sister why she poisoned me and my dad. But never got an answer. What could this mean? I am worried that I could have this dream again. Please help me!
