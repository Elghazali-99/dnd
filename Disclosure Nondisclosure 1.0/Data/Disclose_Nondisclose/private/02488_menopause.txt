Hi, I am 47 and have in the last 6mths noticed sagging skin at the elbow area, on my legs etc. I am glad i found this site because after several trips to the doctors, no one seemed to have an answer but by reading your posts ladies i can see im not the only one to have this problem! like the others it came on in months i dont really no why, i am i think going through the menopause but that in itself is hard to prove ( blood test wise!) im like alot of the other ladies on the site, i exercise, eat well and  am good weight etc, it is depressing when you go to put stuff on that you can still get into because you work hard to maintain your looks etc only to see this problem which makes you feel old. I have recently started hrt low dose estorgen only 0.3mm to see if it helps dont think it will though!! I think the main thng ive learnt from this site is how quick it does come on because that is the one thing i just could not comprehend that this could happen within months yet my face etc people think im alot younger its just weird!! hope this helps anyone else as your site has helped me!
