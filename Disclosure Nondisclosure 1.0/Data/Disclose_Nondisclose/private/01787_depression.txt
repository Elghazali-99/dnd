I'm 14 going on 15 and for the past year or so I've been thinking that I may have depression. I have my good and bad days, my bad days usually being really bad. I have a constant feeling in my stomach like I'm going to throw up and I have tons of negative thoughts and during this time I'm usually hostile and don't get on with other people very well. I also have this weird thing of wanting to cry but just not being able to, it's wanting release from all these bad feelings but not being able to do it. I do not self harm, I used to a few years ago but it was more of a pressure/attention thing. I have suicidal thoughts but never intend on acting on them, my mind leads me back to how other people would feel and how selfish I would be to take my own life and pass my pain onto the people I love. I get tired easily and have little to no motivation to do anything, I drop most of my hobbies, art being the only one that ever stuck (and even then I'll go weeks without drawing or anything). 
I've been mulling over these feelings for a while because sometimes they are stronger then other times which put me off. 
I went to my school cousillor a few months back but ended up not going because I was convinced he thought that it was just either a) my teenage hormones or b) me being lazy and overexagerating. I've been contemplating whether or not to tell my parents and go get a official diagnosis.
