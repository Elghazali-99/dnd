I've always had occasional bouts of depression, never lasting more than a few hours. About a year ago I had to have surgery for some issues with endometriosis. Before the surgery I was suffering a lot, and I was very upset about what I was going through. I remember one day when I came home from school I sat down and just screamed my lungs out for several minutes, I was so depressed. But after the surgery I feel much better, but I'm still a little depressed. I'm on Prozac (20 mg) but I don't think it seems to be doing much good. Anyway, here's what I was wondering about. I don't like people anymore. I still love my mom and my family, but as for my friends at school, and the people I used to think I couldn't live without, I just don't enjoy being around them anymore. Everyone annoys me. I don't enjoy life anymore. I withdraw from social situations, I'm extremely shy, and I don't like talking or meeting new people. Most of the time I avoid having to talk at all if I don't have to. And through all of this, I don't feel depressed. I just don't enjoy being with other people. I only feel like I really suffer from depression once or twice a week or so when I need to just lie in bed and cry for a little while. After a while I feel fine. But I'm never really all that happy. 
I also sleep a lot. I need around 12 hours of sleep to be able to get through the day without a nap. 
 Is social withdrawal a symptom of depression? Is it unusual to feel this way? I just don't feel normal.
