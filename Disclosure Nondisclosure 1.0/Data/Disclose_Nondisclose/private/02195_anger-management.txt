Hi, I have a big problem. I live with my husband, we not married, but we have a 19 months old son. Also his mother is living with us. I am alone here; I don’t have my family or somebody else. I never liked to love with his mother, I wanted to be alone with him and baby, but we couldn’t let her to live alone. Now I realized that I can’t support anymore, I can’t see her anymore. When I am seeing her my body starts shaking, I just hate her. She is not bad, but I fell that she is in control of everything and my baby. When I told my husband that I don’t like certain thinks he is like, what you want she is good, she is really good not like other mother in law. I start hating her more, because he is protecting her, never protected me. I don’t want to live him; I want to keep the family because I want my baby to have a father. But he is not working out. Also he is screaming at me at everything: “You are to fast, you need to do think slowly, you are in hurry, you are bad with my mother, I don’t like this…” at everything. I was trying to explain to him to speak with me calm, I hate when he scream, he is like, 
“ I am not screaming, I am just telling you!!!”
I ask him to move in 2 different apartments, close to each other, like next door, so his mother will be close to us, I just want to have my space, OMG, he got fire: “ Never, what you think, never!”
What do I do, I start getting crazy, I don’t feel any more love, protection and support, what do I do?
Thank you
