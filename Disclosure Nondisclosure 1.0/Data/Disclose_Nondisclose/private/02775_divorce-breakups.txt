Me and my boyfriend of 9 months broke up today, he and I both deactivated our fb for the sake of our relationship I have not once gotten on since I've deactivated it. He had given me his password to his fb because he says he got a notification to his phone from fb. And thought maybe he hadnt deactivated it right. Well today he says he got in his email and noticed someone had been on his fb today and so he logged in to change his password he then says he seen my picture and was confused as to why if I had deactivated it. I had let my brothers friend restore all my info because I had forgotten my password so there's no telling this guy might have been getting on. Well he left me because he said I did him dirty by logging in even though it wasn't me. A week ago he told me he logged in his fb three months ago to see if k was on because i was acting shaddy. He seen nothing cause I was not on. So now our relationship is over because he says I was on. I hurt so bad and I'm so confused. I love this guy so much although he is only 22 I'm 28 I feel in love I feel like nothing without him. I've told him millions of times I wouldn't hurt him but its like nothing I said meant anything.
