So here goes.
I am currently pregnant with my thrid child. My first two from my ex husband. I really love my bf he has been a little glitter of hope in my life towards men. But I am still having issues.
I have never trusted men. Basically in a nut shell my biological dad wanted to kill me and my sister as an infant and greatly harmed my amazing mom. Later on my mom met another man who raised me from the age of 1 and even adopted me. 
He started sexually abusing me at the age of 5.
I met my ex husband in high school and thought I loved him. We later got married and after our first was born (a littlr girl) he changed. He physically and mentally beat me even when I was pregnant with our second. It took me joining the army to leave him. So you see I have never had a male to trust and love. 
My second child is a boy who is 4 and I have a very difficult relationship with him. And I found out this one is a boy as well and I have suffered from gender disappointment so bad. 
Most days I dont want to get out of bed. I find myself antisocial and I also have suffered from severe anxiety attacks. 
I feel so hopeless and not sure what my next step is. And I am not even sure why I posted all this I just dont know what to do and get so tired of going up and down all the time.
am I crazy
