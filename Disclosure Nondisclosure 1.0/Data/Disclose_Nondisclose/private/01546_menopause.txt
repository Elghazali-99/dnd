I received a series of 2 testosterone shots from my hormone doctor in December.   He said this was to help stimulate my body in to making its own since my own levels were very low.   I had a very bad reaction including all the traditional overdose symptoms: Scalp Hair Loss, Extreme Facial Hair Growth, Severe Acne in Oil Production, Loss of Period, Enlarged Clitoris,  Anger/Temper Change, and Change of Voice (Scratchy and unable to produce certain sounds any longer).  I've been through 2 rounds of antibiotics for the acne - not fully working.  And I still have not started my period (missed 3 now) and I'm still losing hair.  Although the facial hair growth is better, it is still not normal.    I've read on a couple other sites that the enlarged clitoris is permanent damage.   I cannot find any reference as to the voice change?  Will my vocal cords recover?  Also, at what point to I need to be worried that my period has not returned? (OK, I'm already very worried but my doctor does not seem to be ...but he actually is not talking to me directly and is communicating only through his nurse)  Any insight and direction would be greatly appreciated.
