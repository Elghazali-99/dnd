My boyfriend is 16 and has told me before that he doesn't see any reason in living. I have been depressed before and I just assumed he was just having a very "black mood" (as my psycologist called it) and that he would get better. I talked him out of it and at the end of the night he seemed ok. He often says that I am all he has left and talks about how horrible the world is. He just seems to be getting worse and I don't know what to do... I don't undersand why he's like this, his life isn't that bad, although I do understand that depression can just happen sometimes. He has low self esteem and hates his Dad, for reasons I can understand (his Dad once told him that he saw me with another guy one day but he and I both knew that I hadn't gone anywhere that night and I have never cheated on him) and he doesn't want to turn out like him. I'm just so confused and want to get him some help but I don't think he'd like the idea at all... He doesn't like people seeing his emotions... Can anyone help me out?? I really want to help him...
