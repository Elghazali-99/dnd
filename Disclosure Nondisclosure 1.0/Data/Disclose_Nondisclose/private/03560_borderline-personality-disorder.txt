I found out I have BPD just over a month ago. I'd been getting treatment for it for the past year and a half (I never asked what was wrong so was never told). I have been discharged from the mental health clinic for now. But I have noticed (especially in the last week) an increase in my biting moods and wanting to self harm. I start of carrying on with my partner and then it ends up with me biting a bit too hard and when I realise I cant do anything but bang my head. It's like it isn't me and its driving my partner and I crazy. The mood swings are soo hard to deal with this week, I don't know what to tell her or what to do. One minute I'll be playing with her over active the next I can't do anything, then I get low and as always I don't know why. Its getting really frustrating again, I was just trying to see if anyone was going through a similar thing as I really need to learn to control it.
 (additional information,  I got braces in a few months ago so I can't bite pens or pencils like I have done in the past as its too uncomfortable)
 Thank you.
