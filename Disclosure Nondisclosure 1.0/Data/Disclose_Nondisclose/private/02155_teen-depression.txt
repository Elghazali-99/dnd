I am a 17 year old female and lately I have been feeling very down. I get irritated at others over the simplest of things, and I usually try my best to seclude myself by staying in my room. I have been reading some articles and taking tests online that seem to point towards depression. It doesn't run in the family to my knowledge and I don't think it has anything to do with my period, seeing as how it is regular. I never have been the most active person, but once in awhile I would like to go out and swim or play tennis. Now all I really want to do now is lay around. I have had trouble sleeping, specifically getting to sleep. I can't seem to stop thinking and usually I have to read or watch tv to the point where I am exhausted and can't keep my eyes open anymore. I don't have trouble focusing on books or activities that I like, but I do forget things and get distracted easily. I also suffer from frequent headaches. Is this a sign of depression or something else? What should I do?
