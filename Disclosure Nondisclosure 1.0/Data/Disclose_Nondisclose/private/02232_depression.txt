recently in a bar/pub while celebrating with friends n family, my niece pushed me telling me to go away, i saw her cousin crying and was there to offer help and understand her tears. i did nothing initially and continued to console my crying niece. then she did it again and i pushed her straight back. within seconds i was jumped upon and removed from both niece's view, i must have taken a hit to the head or have been shocked myself for what  i just did, because i am struggling to piece the rest together. i was verbally abused by my brother inlaw (for which i surely deserve) i was accused of hitting his daughter, and everyone there really thought i had done this ( my niece did not attempt to set them straight or state the reason why i pushed her in the first instance). i tried to explain myself, but was called a lier and then a couple or people got in my face and the same question was asked over and over, i was then pushed around and received bruises up and down my body, My mind went blank and my body went into defensive mode, i then fought back not knowing who i was fighting or why? such an idiotic thing to do to my niece to start with, i sure ended very hurt and fractured in a couple places. i dont know how to pick myself up from here, i have lost my sister and her little family - they did correct the Hit to a push the following day and said i deserve all i got. this hurt me because i feel that it would not have blown up so big if my niece had told them straight away why i pushed her back. i miss my sister and family, please help?
