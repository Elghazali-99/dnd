My girlfriend told me she was recently drugged at a wine bar and made a unclear fuzzy desicion to drive home and allow the man that was coming on to her to come back to hear apt. She says she has a very fuzzy memory of doing this and just bits and parts of driving home and telling him where to park, where to meet her, and saying goodbye to her mother and going back to her apt while her son was sleeping. She only recalls small parts of the night, un able to move or resist by that time she was home... Naked in bed with him... She doesn't recall if there was intercourse, she remembers going into her sons room to ask for help but she was smiling , happy, she believes the effect of the drug. and she said he left soon after that... She Â woke up feeling very sick , hangover like, and recalls only having two glasses of white wine the night before. She believes she was drugged... she threw up twice and noticed something blue in the toilet... What do I do now? She was raped. Date drug raped. What is the best way I can support her?
