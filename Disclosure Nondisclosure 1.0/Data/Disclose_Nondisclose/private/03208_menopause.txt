Hi, I have been taking Topomax for migraines for 1 1/2 yrs with very good results, in the last 6-8 months I have had very irregular menstrual bleeding ( cycles of 11-15 days) along with some more symptoms that suggest that something is off ( brittle nails, tiredness, sweat episodes, mood swings, weight gain especially around the abdominal area ). I am under some stress on a daily basis (small children, work shifts with long hours waking up at 3 a.m on some days and sometimes coming home at 6 a.m)  I was just recently after going through a series of tests to rule out any thyroid problems or other diagnosed with augmented LH and FSH levels and was prescribed Prometrium. I am 40 yrs old and my doctor said to try that before we start a different hormonal treatment for menopause since I'm rather young still. My question is threefold, is it possible the Topomax onset the early menopause and if discontinued is it reversible? And since I'm worried about the symptoms I described above (weight gain , tiredness et.c) why would I take a drug that seems to have all those symptoms as side effects (that's what I've been reading about Pometrium). I need all my mental focus in my work and can not go through life dizzy or disoriented as I'm sure many people can not. I am feeling very confused as what to do here.
