32 yrs.  I thought it was a good marriage.  We were "best friends", enjoyed doing things together.  Then it all changed.  I get it that it is related to his "mid-live crisis" and have jouralized trying to figure out what went wrong.  It's really impossible to place blame entirely on him and i can see areas where i've made my own contributions to his boredom with me.  Basically, i have to come to grips that all of my hopes and dreams and what i thought our lives would be isn't going to happen.  I've thought about sucide, seriously.  I just can't imagine not goi.ng forward in this vaccum.  We have grown children and if i did kill myself it would really hurt them and i don't want that.  He isn't interested in makeing even the slightest effort to make things better and i can't make it happen.  I can't "fix" it, he doesn't love me anymore, said he hadn't loved me for a long time, can't stand to be around me, etc.  If it's another woman, there's nothing i can do about that.  Even if its a relationship that isn't working for him, it'll be someone else eventually.  I've cried a river of tears, begged him not to leave me and all of that was useless.  I'm trying to find a job, any job (but who wants to hire a 66 year old woman?)  I'm scared on how i will be able to support myself.  I can't affort counciling... i can't discuss it with my children, i have a few friends but its just to difficult to discuss it because i start crying.  i feel like i just need to stay away from everyone.  He's coming to get some of this things soon and i don't know if i can stand to see him and definately not speak to him.  I made a list of things i need from him, the house keys, the mail box key, the gate opener, and intend to have a cop here when he comes.  This only makes him more angry and he says cruel stuff to me.  Now there is no going back, i have to figure out how to move forward.  I pray for God to show me the way.  But honestly, i just can't deal with the loss, its just so vast.
