So i'm a 19 year old girl and i am worried that i am at risk of slipping back into depression again.  When I was 14 i was bullied severly, and being adopted have never formed a close relationship with my adoptive parents, meaning that I was very self conscious and kept everything to myself.  I dealt with this by self harming and refusing to eat anything (i became an anorexic).  However I overcome this at the age of 18 when I went to university.  I made some brilliant friends and got my confidence back, as well as being in a long term relationship.  However, late october of last year my best friends dad jumped in front of a train in front of us and killed himself.  Since that day, my best friend who I've grown up with since birth said she couldnt ever see me again because I would remind her of that day.  I have nothing against her decision and wish her the very best, the only problem was that my previous school friends also abandonned me-as to not upset her, and then a week after this all happened my so called 'best' friend from uni decided it would be funny to play a practical joke based around this traumatic event.  Now i am struggling to find work- the typical stupid reason being that i'm "over qualified" (like that makes sense), my mum is constantly on my case, and has gone out of her way on several occasions to make sure i have no way of being happy and getting success, and all i can think is that i don't know how to cope without slipping back into my old ways! I haven't self-harmed in 6 months and promised myself that was the last time, yet now i'm stumped as to  how to deal with everything......................please help!
