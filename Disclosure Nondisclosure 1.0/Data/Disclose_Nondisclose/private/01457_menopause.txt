I am several years post menopause, on bioidentical hormone patches and progesterone. Basically I feel horrible. I have no creative energy, libido, humor, and I feel somewhat fatigued and fuzzy headed. I can't think or work out problems. I want to sleep 10-12 hours a day and that isn't possible. I don't look my age but I have gained weight that just won't go away. People run into me and don't know me. It is really stressful and happened really fast. My doctor has tried antidepressants and testosterone cream, but they don't help. The hormones helped with the hot flashes and such but nothing else. I exercise by walking a few times a week. I work at a computer and can't just leave and go exercise anytime I choose. I am starting to think that life after menopause is just waiting to die. I am not having any fun, and I used to be a lively, fun person. I don't know what to do about this lack of life. Are there any herbal remedies for postmenopausal blahs? Anything else I can ask my doctor for?
