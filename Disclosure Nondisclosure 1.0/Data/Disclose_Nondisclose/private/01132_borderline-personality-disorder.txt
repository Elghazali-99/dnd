Both my girlfriend and I are about 20 years old and both in college, being in college we've done some experimenting with drugs.  A while back my girlfriend and I took shrooms, longs story short she had a really bad trip ended up getting arrested and thrown in the drunk tank.  Since then she's been having these disillusion thoughts that me and all my friends are in a cult to conspire against her, she brought it up after she got back from the police station about how she thought the police, paramedics, firefighters, my friends, myself and everybody else was scheming against her.  She was convinced that she didn't actually go to a real jail and everything was scripted and everybody was working against her.
Now I haven't heard anything about it for a while, last night we took some x (i know i know it's dangerous but I'd rather just get help with the problem at hand). we don't do drugs a lot (besides smoking) and maybe a few times a year but that's it.  anyways last night after she was coming down from her roll she started telling me about how she thinks everybody is in a cult working to change her life and who she is, she says shes not sure now if they're trying to bring her down. but she said she was convinced that my friends and i were all acting.
all of this of course is absolutely ridiculous and I tried explaining that to her but she refused to believe that and pretended to believe me telling me "She'll believe me for now."
What do you all think?  I'm not very knowledgeable about mental health or mental disorders, I asked her if she had any and she said no.. What could this be?
