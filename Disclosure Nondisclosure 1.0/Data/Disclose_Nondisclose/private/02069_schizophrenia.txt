Hello I am twenty years old and at one time my father was diagnosed by the Mayo Clinic with schizophrenia (this was in a single session). I have read much about it's onset and genetic implications and am worried for my own sake. My father was a severe alcoholic from childhood (age 13). During his time in rehab he reported seeing hallucinations of rats with people's faces and at one point towards the end of his life pretended to have a brain tumor using thorough research (of which he convinced our whole family). He would ramble about strange nonsensical things, go catatonic etc. Keep in mind this may have been him acting but there were throughout his life periods of drinking where he said he saw satan and all kinds of crazy things. He also suffered from DT (delirium tremors) which actually killed him. Is it possible these are explainable as symptoms of DT, is that a more logical conclusion? 
I myself suffer from anxiety and severe depression, related to the difficult life I've lived and more recently the loss of both my brother and best friend to suicide. I often experience and have since childhood, a playful sort of paranoid thoughts like "what if everyone was an alien" or thinking things like "I wonder if that unmarked truck is cop". I often have a constant fear that I will be arrested and sometimes make connections to thing I know are silly. Now I am in no way convinced of things in the typical delusional sense, but have since the loss of my best friend had the general feeling that the world is out to get me. Is this possibly just anxiety or are these sort of paranoias typical of Schizophrenic? There is no other history that I know of in my father's side of the family for Schizophrenia, there is however alcoholism. Please help me sort this out if you can as I can't really afford a therapist or any type of mental health doctor. 
 Thank you all.
