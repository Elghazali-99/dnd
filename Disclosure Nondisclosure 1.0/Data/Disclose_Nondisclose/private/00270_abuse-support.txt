Ok so my stepson is terrified of his grandfather and we don't know why. He doesn't spend time with him all the time. This one time he did spend time with him on the week after that when asked if he wanted to go over he said "no"! he even cried and cried saying he didn't want too. When his grandfather came over to see him he didn't even wanna come down the stairs to see him. He had to be brought down the stairs crying. He didn't even wanna look at him or say hi. When asked why he said he didnt wanna say hi or talk to him. He didn't wouldn't even look at him. This is oviously not normal. When asked why he wouldn't say why. We asked if his grandfather did anything to him he said ''no''. Ever since that day he has only been with him once. And that was just to go to the dentist. But he never wants to see him. Why is this happening? I dont wanna think bad things but why would a child not wanna see his gradfather this bad. He cries and gets so upset. Please give me some advice or help me out.
