Hello Im 22 yrs of age and i live on my own and very distant towards my parents for all the years of physical, mental, and emotional abuse! Im a sister of 6. My 3 youngest sisters still live at home. The 19 year old is mentally challenged, there is also a 16 and 14 yr. old. My Father is a alcoholic, drug abuser, woman beater,felon and has been in and out of jail every since before i was born,he not suppose to be living there with them but when I told the police that they didnt do nothing about it, should i say he is a good talker when he thinks he is in trouble. Never  been their for none of us. My mother is the type that she would do for her men before she do for her kids any day. Between me and the 2 oldest we no longer talk with the parents but still try to keep in touch with the younger ones to make sure everything is alright. My mother has full custody of the 19 yr. old cause of her disability but all she reallly wanted is to get her check. They are not allowed to leave the house. The kids get physically, mentally, emotionally abused everyday by the father the mother is never really home cause she stays at her boyfriend house most nights. Between me and the 2nd oldest sister, we really want to have them. I actually have two extra bedrooms in my house. But i do not know about how I would actually go thru with it. I dont want the kids have to go thru what the rest of us experience cause we are very scarred. I wish i could go a day without remembering my past and being so ANGRY at them. All I want to know is sum opinions on what i should do. Anon. Report abuse, foster. i just really need some ideas cause im very torn on what i should really do cause from my experience before i have already went to court about this when i was a kid and the system failed me. So please I just need opinions on what you think i should do I would greatly appreciate it.
