So I'm 18 Years old I'm a girl and I can say I'm pretty as long as lots of people compliment me , so yeah I never really
Felt pretty because of my bad breath ! Whenever someone tells me you are pretty I'm like nah you don't know I'm **** even if I'm I'm just so useless because I literally can't talk seriously even I chew gum all the time it doesn't help 
You don't know the feeling until you are really In it I'm so depressed my true personality is a kind funny joyful character but because of my all the time bad breath I'm supposed to act different to get away people from me ! Even 
I can't talk face to face to my mum and siblings I hate living life this way being away from friends family and cousins 
And knowin that people call you stinky ! I tried probiotics and it caused me heart palpitations so I quitted taking it
I don't know what's the problem I floss I gargle I do every thing but still it's there .,. I don't what's my problem please help me my life is just feels like hell ... Help me
