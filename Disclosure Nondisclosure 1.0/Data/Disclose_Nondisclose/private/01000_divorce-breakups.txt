Dilemma; Should I  allow for flexibility & cooperation on my behalf to a request my ex made for an extension of the court ordered visitation, or stay firm until our new court date new month?? He refuses to cooperate with any of my requests or emails, contacts me when he wants something, then demands an answer asap. Should I say yes...or no to the extension on the court ordered visitation time? ..Ive only become firm in the past two mths as the issues of emotional & verbal abuse towards mounted . I advised him we need to go back to the court ordered time until our new court case is heard. If and or when I attempt to communicate thru email with him re childrens issues, or requests, he threatens to call the police for harassment. This is the second time in 4 visits that he has asked for the time to be extended in his favor for drop off times. I feel no recourse but to stick with court ordered visitation time, but he will blames me telling my children they cant do special things/outtings because I wont let him keep them longer..Im so frustrated!!!I This time its a "special" Easter dinner with his g/fs family that the children enjoy visiting..i know he is just using them too ensure he gets to do what he wants, but he will tell them different. Should I say yes..or no..I keep changing my mind..and I just cant decide what is best. I dont want to lower myself to his level, yet I dont want him to feel like he can consistently bend the rules with offering any cooperation with what i ask.
