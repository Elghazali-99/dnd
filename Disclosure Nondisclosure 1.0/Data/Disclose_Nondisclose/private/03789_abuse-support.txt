Hi all, 
 I would appreciare any opinios as it's the first time I've reached out to anyone about my situation. 
My husband is Arabic and was what I thought to be very open minded. He has always been a little controlling however since I was a little wayward I didn't mind too much. We have been married for 4 years altho together for 7. He never really speaks nicely to me anymore, nor to out 2 year old son. He either adores him or ignores him. He never spends any time with us at all, hasn't been home for more than an hour in the past 3 weeks, he hits him sometimes in dicipline- but a few times smacked him too hard or too many times. For me, He checks my phone for calls and messages, takes my ipad to check history, doesn't let me drive, not allowed to go anywhere without him, not allowed to talk to men, has to have access to my e-mail account, not allowed to have a facebook account, he frequently loses his temper and screams, swears and calls me names, throws things at me, pushes me over, has choked me twice, held me tight enough to leave marks, punched me in the side of the face, locked me in the baby's nursery with the baby until I gave him my ATM code number. Took my money for the rent and spent half of it on a new laptop. Am I being abused? If so, is it bad enough to leave him? 
 Thnak you
