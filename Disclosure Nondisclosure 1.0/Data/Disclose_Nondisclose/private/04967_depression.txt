I do not know even where to begin. I did so much research to obtain Health Insurance from Healthcare.gov that I could probably be an expert in it. Apparently I am not because I must have made a fatal mistake by going with BCBS HMO. 
 Problem – 01
 Absolutely no Doctors are taking this insurance. I call the Health Insurance on my card and call the Doctors office and both are saying that I am screwed. I call BCBS and they say go online and check and also call in to see if Doctor is in Network. I go online see a Doctor call in and make sure with BCBS and call the Doctors office and low and behold the Doctor says they are not in network. 
 Also I went to the Doctor under a certain hospital to get my back looked at and ended up needing some x-rays he made me get x-rays from the same hospital he works for and the x-ray department is not within network. 
 I am trying to find an orthopedic doctor to go to but literally and I am not joking every doctor I call say they are not taking the affordable health care insurance. Does not matter if they are on the preferred list or not they say that list isn’t updated yet.
 Looks like my life is over. 
 Problem – 02
 I found one hospital that might take Humana POS that is offered from healthcare.gov but I already have BCBS. I talked to one of the reps on healthcare.gov and they say this will be a colossal mess. They will have to change my insurance to another provider and all kinds of taxes and deductions will get mixed up. I cannot afford BCBS sending me a bill for the difference of what I did not pay in tax credit. 
 Solutions?
 I am unsure of what to do. I got the best BCBS plan you can get but nobody will take it. If I switch it will be a colossal nightmare. If I break my leg my life is over. I mean this stuff is still expensive even though it is from the exchange. 
 Please help me because I am sinking into a depression and I do not know if I can pull myself out of this one. This is all just too much.
 Best,
