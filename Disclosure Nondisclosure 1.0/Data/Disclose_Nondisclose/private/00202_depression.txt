Hi, I'm new to this forum but I really need any sort of help I can get at this point so here I am. I'm 21, female, and have had Major Depressive Disorder since I was about 10 or 11 years old. I was on Lexapro for 5 years then hospitalized and then was on a variety of different anti-depressants for a few years until earlier this summer my newest psychiatrist decided to put me back on Lexapro 20mg as it is what is working for my mom. My problem is that I am dealing with an immense amount of suicidal ideation and planning on a daily basis, and I really can't control it. I remember being highly suicidal when I was first on Lexapro, but I was also dealing with some terrible situations and saw it as a normal reaction to dealing with that. I admit I am still going through a lot right now, but I know I've found ways to feel normal before, before starting Lexapro again. I feel like there are two different people in me right now, one just craving to end it all and not have to worry about a single thing again and then there's the normal me that wants to keep fighting. It's literally a battle in my head between the two all day every day. I have a psychiatrist with a phenomenal reputation, but I feel she's just too busy to deal with me and what I am going through, as she deals with many other serious clientele. I'm lost as to what to do, my withdrawals from Lexapro include even worse suicidal ideation than when I am on it, plus I get the brain zaps and constantly feel nauseous. I am also afraid there are little medications left to try out and I really don't want to be hospitalized again, though that is what my mom is recommending. If anybody has any advice, beneficial research, or even just stories of overcoming I would really appreciate it; anything that could help would be nice. I don't think I actually want to die, but I'm afraid that part of me that does want that has been winning for the past couple months and I don't want to make a stupid, permanent decision.
