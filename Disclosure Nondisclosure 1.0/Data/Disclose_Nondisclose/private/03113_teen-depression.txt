I used to paint, read, hang out with friends and enjoy life all the time. I have had a decently tough life being kicked out at 14, moving in with my sister until i fell in love and moved out on my own. i'm still only 18 but i am engaged and living with my fiance and a roommate. he isn't the problem but i figured i'd give some backgroud.. but as time went on i stopped painting, reading, hanging out with friends and enjoying myself altogether. i have no idea what i want to do with my life, i am going to school but i have no idea for what. i quit my job to be lazy and just go to school. all i ever do day after day is sit in bed and watch stupid shows i dont care about. i want to change but i lack the motivation. i feel like i may only want to change because i almost feel obligated to...not because i want to. i have no desire to see my friends, to paint, to even have fun. i doubt i would have fun doing anything i used to do, after awhile "fun" became a chore. i hate being around most people. i'm not suicidal or anything but i hate my life for the most part. the only good thing about it is my fiance who is the only one who can make me smile and my dog for being just as lazy as i am. i dont know whats wrong with me. i doubt anyone on here can help me but i have to try SOMETHING...anything. so if anyone can tell me whether or not i'm depressed or just plain...lifeless. i'd appreciate it.
