My boyfriend is a paranoid schizophrenic. We've been together for about 7 months now, and things are really starting to get difficult - we are arguing almost twice a week - and I think his untreated schizophrenia is playing a significant part in that.
 I myself have BPD (borderline personality disorder), whereby I am prone to depressive periods and anxiety. I take medication and have received counselling for this, and have the disorder under control.
 My boyfriend used to see a case worker about his schitz, and was taking Seroquel - this is about 2.5 years ago, right when he was diagnosed. He stopped taking the medication and soon after because he couldn't cope with the side effects, and wasn't even visiting his case worker anymore due to pressures at work. He has been officially untreated for about 2 years now.
 As is the case with schizophrenia, he experiences psychotic episodes and delusions. These I can support him through. However, it's when he becomes emotionally stunted, controlling and manipulative towards me that I cannot cope. 
 He often uses the fact that I have BPD as an excuse for our arguments, despite acknowledging that he has schizophrenia and receives no treatment for it. He likes to think he has the disorder under control, but the reality is far from it, and it is really starting to push me away to the point where I am considering leaving him for my own health and wellbeing.
 I love him very much and desperately want him to speak to a therapist about how he is feeling, so that he can get the help he needs and we can get our relationship back on track.
 Does anyone have any advice about the best way for me to convince him that this is a good idea? I do not want to threaten him with our relationship (i.e. "see a therapist or we're finished) to get my point across.
 Any help appreciated. Thank you.
