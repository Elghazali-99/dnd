Hi there. I'm hoping someone may be able to give me some advice. I've been with my boyfriend nearly 2 years and we are very much in love and have a great bond. He has 2 children (16 and 11) from his marriage. They live with their mum and come over and stay some weekends. However, whenever we are alk together, I don't feel happy. I find it very difficult to identify with my feelings and that causes tension with my boyfriend sometimes because i just cannot deacribe or explain how i feel. I come from an abused background and I'm aware the my own issues are being triggered. I've had councelling on and off for years. I suppose my question is, although I know i have come to terms with him previously being married and having kids (jealousy?), how can i deal with the feelings i get? Identify with triggers? The kids are polite around me. Could it be jealousy that my boyfriend is protecting and loving his kids the way i wished mt father had done when i was wee? Isn't that feeling wrong/inappropriate? I feel bad for thinking like that but I cant help it. Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated. I just want ti stop feeling like that and just be happy but it's like i'm not allowing myself to be and i dont know how. Thanks for listening.
