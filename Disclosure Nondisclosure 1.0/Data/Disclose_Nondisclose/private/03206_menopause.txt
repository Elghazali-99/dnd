Hi,
 I am 45 years old.  Last year there were a few times that I skipped a period having my period 60 some days apart.  I can't remember when I last had it at this point so I am going by the last time I wrote it down and that is in November.  I have been having bloating and pain and backaches when I SHOULD be getting my period but it doesn't come.  I have not experienced the pre-period frequent bowel movements that I usually do.  So I am in pain from all the bad symptoms without the benefit of the monthly cleaning out if you know what I mean.  I called my doctor and was put on medroxyprogesterone for 10 days.  I am now 14 days out after starting the meds, so 4 days after stopping and no period yet.  What happens next?  Does anyone know?  If the medroxyprogresterone doesn't work, what do they do now?  I feel there is someting wrong because I am having period symptoms and no period.  I swear I feel I have several months of bloating going on and am so afraid I will wind up in the hospital if/when bleeding ever begins.  
 My first period at 12 was crazy, I was in the hospital for 5 days and lost 10 pounds.  Doctors said that there was a build up of estrogen that prevented my period from starting on time and then I lost a few months all at once.  I had to have multiple blood transfusions while in the hospital.  
 I am so afraid something like that will happen to me again.  
 I can't even call my doctor YET because they said bleeding anywhere from 2-7 days after stopping the medicine.  I just think is ridiculous, seriouly why didn't they just give me an abortion pill and put me out of my misery.
 Anything thoughts are welcome, please I just need to talk to someone about this, I feel so alone in this.  My mom died when I was 21 so she is not here for me to talk to about this.
 thank you
