I am 54 years old and just  a few months ago I suddenly had no period, hot flashes every 20 minutes day and night, migraines and headaches, anxiety and irritability.I also have insomnia, but have had that for years. It felt like PMS with hot flashes and without the period! I could not function at work without any sleep, so I had to find help with bioidentical hormones in another province as I am in a small region and the doctors here will not even discuss Bioidentical Hormones. After a saliva test found that I had below therapeutic levels of estrogen and progesterone, I was started on the estrogen and progesterone cream. It did not seem to be helping, so the dosages were increased significantly. About 4 days after starting the increased doses, I began to experience what felt like a UTI. Two antibiotics later and no relief. In fact I now have this constant burning between the clitoris and urethra. It does not burn when I urinate, but burns when I stop and it definitely gets worse as the day goes on. It truly is mind numbing and debilitating. I have decided to stop the hormones for 2 days which is what the prescription states if you do not get a period...5 days off if you do. I wanted to see if the symptoms of this mind numbing burning pain in the vulva was attributed at all to the increase in the bioidentical hormones. Has anyone else experienced this? It would make sense since we have so many estrogen and progesterone receptors in the genitourinary areas. 
 Thank you to all the wonderful women who share their stories and are looking for answers. You really do have to be your own advocate . Any other women experiencing what I am experiencing I would love to hear from and share ideas.
