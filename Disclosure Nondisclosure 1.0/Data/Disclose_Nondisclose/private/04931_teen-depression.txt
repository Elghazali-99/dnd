I have this friend who I met through the high school I use to go to (I am in college now). She is two grades younger then me. We knew each other through a mutual friend and as the two of us started to talk we discovered we both had mental problems. She is recovered from anorexia and I have self injured for years and more recently I developed problems with food and weight. 
well recently she was in the hospital for a couple of weeks and I freaked cause I thought she relapsed into her anorexia. I started feeling really guilty cause I though I had triggered her cause I talked to her about my eating problems. 
when she got out I found out that she didnt relapse with her anorexia (thank goodness) but she had been planning on killing herself. she also is self injurying on a higher level then she use to. 
my the question I have is what should I do? everytime I talk to her now she doesnt seem to be bothered by the fact that she almost DIED!!! I dont want her to just keep living a life full of depression and self injury like I did. She doesnt seem to want to recover and when I was her age neither did I and now I am still dealing with **** because I didnt try to get myself better. what can I do or say? I want to be the best support I can to her and I dont know how. I want to scream everytime I find out she has cut again. She is getting help (meds and therapy) but I want to know what I can do.
