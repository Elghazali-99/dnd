I'm  a male aged 39.
I took a series of ibuprofen and paracetamol overdoses about 8 months ago, whereby I tool a large amount of pills. During the course of several weeks, I took about 10-15 grams of ibuprofen and some additional Paracetamol each time.  I cannot remember how much Paracetamol I took. This happened at least 8 times, and although my symptoms at the time were minimal, I suffered with headaches, back ache, stomach ache and some nausea.
I have since had quite bad heartburn probably from all the gerd etc.
I always drank a lot of wine whenever I did this, which I appreciate will have made things even worse.
Before anyone lectures me, I already know how stupid and senseless this was, especially for my family. However, I was in a very dark place back then, but I have made a lot of life changes since then for the better.
My question is, could this episode of self harm have affected my liver or kidneys? I ask because I seem to get some mild paid from my Right kidney shortly after I have a drink. I have recently had some blood tests too, and my GP said my liver blood tests were high. I'm currently awaiting the results from a liver scan, and I'm having further blood tests next week too. My GP is not aware of the self harm. I have since been feeling very tired, I'm eating g a lot so have put weight on and I struggle to concentrate on my work and get quite angry with people.
 Any thoughts from the pro's on here and any similar situations from others?
