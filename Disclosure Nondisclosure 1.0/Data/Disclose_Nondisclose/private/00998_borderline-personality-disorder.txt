I posted this on scizofrenia but it didn't fit at all. I was told to post it here instead.
 I think I have some sort of problem, but I don't know what. 
I am a 15 year old girl from the UK. Towards the end of year nine at school I started acting differently. I had always been quiet a quiet person, in school. But I started hitting, calling and throwing things at people at every opportunity. I did this because I wanted them to annoy me, to anger me. I wanted to be genuinly angry. The I would shout at the person who had annoyed me. I did this to get attention. It wasn't very bad in year nine but in year ten it was much worse. 
 I would sit, making plans for the next day, at night. Things like how I was going to act. How many things I was going to do to get the attention. The scary thing is I would always stick to it. Then I started wanting to annoy some of my teachers so I would be worse in there class. I also started refusing to speak and work. I would just sit there and not do anything. When the teacher came over to me I would stay silent. I had a thing about putting my hand up to my face to hide myself, I called this my safety position. 
 I just wanted the attention from the teachers. I would be very sly when annoying the person in the first place, so that the teacher wouldn't notice until I started shouting. 
 I am really quite a nervouse person in coversation anyway and eye contact is almost impossible. I think myself as a nice person when I am not acting in this way, but I need to know why I am acting in this way. 
 Thanks for taking the time to read this.
