Hi hoping some of you may have experienced something similar or have any suggestions... 
I am 19 years old and have been on birth control pills since I was about 15 due to severe cramping and shortly after had my first serious boyfriend. Everything had been going really well until about a month and a half ago. 
I had always had small anxious episodes about school work or my busy schedule, normal college teenager things but in the past month they have been more frequent and about nothing really. My anxiety attacks come out of nowhere. One second I'm fine and having a good time and the next second I just can't seem to clear my mind and my stomach starts hurting and I just worry. I feel nervous about everything in my life for a couple minutes and then it subsides again. I decided to go off the pill because there was a two week period last month where I would just lay in bed and cry for hours at a time because I just felt so overwhelmed. Its really starting to interfere with my daily life. I don't want to leave my house as much as I used to and I find myself canceling plans with friends . I have read that in most cases it takes about 3 months for hormones to regulate after stopping the pill and so far its only been 15 days, but I'm still having frequent anxiety and crying attacks. I have no family history of depression, but do you think this is something caused by the pill or should I seek further help and look into antidepressants?
