In mid December I found out I was pregnant. 20 weeks pregnant. And I didn't even know! I had been tested for pregnancy multiple times, and all of the results were negative. Little did I know,  I was Damn near 5 months along. When Christmas rolled around I was rushed to the emergency room because I had a miscarriage. Words can not express how devastated I was. I had just found out I was pregnant, I was just trying to let it sink in and boom, it ended just like that. I'm 17 years old. I was 16 when this happened. The look on the doctors face when they told me there was no heart beat was astonishing. It was like, they didn't know whether to be happy our sad for me. And that was hard to swallow. Should I be happy? Or should I be upset? I can't help but think that if I would have been a 25 year old married woman that they would have reacted differently. That maybe they would have tried to comfort me. But they didn't. Nobody did. I lost most my friends because it was "too hard to handle and they couldn't help me" . Half of my friends didn't even reply when I told them. Why isn't it just as upsetting when a teenager has a miscarriage? No, I have no idea what it's like to have a kid and maybe I wasn't ready for one. I'm still a kid myself right? Has anyone else experienced this? It's been months but I can't pull myself our of this slump. And nobody understands because none of my friends have ever been pregnant. I just feel alone I guess. I feel like when My baby died it took a huge chunk of me with it. Please tell me I'm not the only Teen to have to go through this.?
