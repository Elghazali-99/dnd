Hello 2 years ago I was diagnosed with PTSD and Paranoid Schitzah whatever lol right... I have been off my meds for.. 3 days now, I'm 17 and havn't told my doctor shh! I havn't slept for 2 days but hey I'm quitting cold turkey because I hate over sleeping especially now college is on the table no ones gonna wanna employ someone who's on an anti psychotic drug! C'mon let's get real.
 I want to be free! Feel like I'm no longer sick it'd be great to feel untreated and normal for once haha! 
Aaanyyywaayyy! I like me now that I'm off it y'feelz?!(I like doing american accents) Lol I feel energetic! Full of life! And and.. I think that's it hmm oh! & just love it y'know? I live in london btw pardon my manners for not mentioning it in the first place but my names Sarah I'm 17 and just don't want that poison in me anymore.
 So back to my original question almost forgot what I was going to ask haha, but yeah is it a good idea to just give it up straight? I don't wanna tell my psych cause he would psych out! Burd dum bom chh!! So what's your opinions? Loool I was about to write what's your onions! -Sarah
