Hello dear forum members!
 I posted this question to occupational safety division, but it seems like expert over there is not answering the questions since October. Well, I want to seek your advice.
 I am 22 years old. As an auditor I've been revising oil refinery laboratory and petcoke production workshop for a short period of time. More precisely, I was controlling different benzene analyses in the lab, there was a problem with ventilation and was a very strong smell of benzene around. It lasted about two hours and I had a headache few hours afterwards. 
In a petcoke production workshop I was inhaling petcoke vapour for about 10 minutes directly by standing in an enclosed space with hot petcoke, and was somewhere around these vapours for about half an hour. 
 The accidents described above happened in two different days with a 10 days interval between them. Benzene exposure was the last one and I feel absolutely fine after couple of hours, same as after petcoke exposure. Since I'm hypochondriac, the questions that worries me is: 
Do these short-term activities increase the risk of any type of cancer or chronic blood or lung disease in the future? 
 Thank you in advance and kind regards to all of you, 
George.
