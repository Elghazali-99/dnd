So to make a long story short I am freaking out. On Saturday 26th my bf and I were cuddling and I sat on his lap (straddled him) both of us had clothes on (yoga pants and panties for me and sweat pants and cotton boxers for him) and then i noticed that he had gotten an erection, after a few minutes I moved away from it and eventually got off of his lap (no stroking, no thrusting involved) his pants didn't seem wet but the inside of my panties were damp (im guessing perspiration or arousal ) ..later i have had what l assumed was painful ovulation (bloating, pains, cramps, fatigue ,etc) following that there was a slight brown-ness in my cervical mucus(TMI sorrry) ...is there a chance that I could be pregnant ??? (I currently have occasional sharp pains in both ovaries, I'm bloated and should be due for my period on the 8th
 P.S also note that I believe I ovulated on Sunday the 27(the day after the lap incident) ...my nipples aren't sore, they aren't darker, I am not having morning sickness....its just not normal for me to have painful ovulation or intense ovarian pangs without a period .....what's wrong with me?  I don't think I'm pregnant?(WE DIDN'T HAVE SEX) ,PMS?,cysts?
