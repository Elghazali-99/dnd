Hello,
This post is a little lengthy and may seem like a rant but I really need some help and input. All I ask is that you please come with an open mind and don't shoot me down and call me crazy.
 -April 22nd was put on Lexapro
 - May 3rd stopped taking it because things got better, I thought I didn't need it and I kinda went behind my moms back taking the pills because I took them without her even knowing (which she was furious at)
 -May 5th Helped my granny with her garden, came home and noticed a white spot near my upper lip
 - May 6th started taking Lexapro again because the thought of possibly having Vitligo was devastating
 -June 8th I developed a spot of alopecia areata , I remember because it was at my cousins grad party and quite embarrasing. My doctor thought it was tinea capitis however.
 - July 23rd stopped taking Lexapro again because I really hated how it made me feel.
 - July 25th a white spot developed below the lower right part of my lip and I started taking the Lexapro again
 - August 23rd I went to my doctor and asked to be discontinued from Lexapro. We talked for about an hour and I finally convinced her. I was to take 5 mg for 4 days and then 2.5 mgs for 4 days.
 -August 25th a spot at the base of my left middle finger developed
 -October 16th the spot under my lip vanished
 Now that I'm off lexapro for good, nothing happens, no more spots appear and my hair doesn't fall out. This isn't normal but my doctor just won't listen to me. I've never taken any sort of medication before, not even a multivitamin, hell I didn't even have insurance before April. I don't have a family history of autoimmune diseases, tested negative for ANA, I've been depressed/ stressed before and nothing happened. You can't tell me that this isn't suspicious. I mean, my dermatologist was intrigued by this and thought it was funny that nothing happened prior to medication and nothing happened after and went on to say that everybody is different and that things effect us in different ways, even going as far as to say that it was possible but she said I should get my thyroid checked. I've been researching ALOT, everything I've been finding fits together... I'll even link stuff if you want me to. And I'm not saying I know more than any doctor or specialist, I'm just saying I know myself. Now do you think I have to wait this out? I've been reading about people discontinuing Lexapro but still having problems for months. So will my body eventually go back to how it was pre-lexapro? Should I find a new doctor? I need some input.
