Where do I start? Well, first off, I have been with my amazing fiance for two years and we have a beautiful newborn daughter together. Our relationship is extremely satisfying on all demensions and I feel truly blessed to be able to call him 'mine.' He truly is everything I desire in a man and I enjoy watching how we evolve as a couple and as individuals. However, some times I catch myself thinking about my ex and how he is doing or if he still thinks about me. It has been over 3 years since we've split and Ive had absolutely no interest in reconciling with him. He has tried to contact me several times since our breakup although I've never replied. To be honest,  our relationship was extremely toxic. I was not allowed to do anything without him, was constantly belittled, and found out that among his compulsive lying issues, he had cheated on me via online sexual chatting/webcaming in the beginning of our relationship. I gave him an ultimatum to get help or I would end our relationship.  After 5 months of no change, I ended it. I decided to go to counseling to find what was in myself(or lack there of) that caused me to he attracted to men like him. I also became involved in my church, got my personal training certificate, and stayed single for about a year until I met my now fiance. He has been an awesome man ever since and is totally opposite from my ex. He treats me very well and is insightful and intuitive. So why do I think at all about my ex? Does anyone else have this problem? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.
