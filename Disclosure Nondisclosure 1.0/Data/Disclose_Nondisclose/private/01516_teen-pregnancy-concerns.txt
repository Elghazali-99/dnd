Hello I'm 17 I turn 18 in March . I live in California . My son turns 4 month on the 30th . I have been with my sons father since I was 15 . We live together at my parents . We plan on getting married in July . We both work full time jobs i get paid 10.25 an he gets paid 12 . My son goes to daycare on scholarship so its free . We have been approved to be on the waiting list for some apartments . They soonest they have openings is in May . So everything is going great rite now Thank God ... But we just found out I'm pregnant again . We do have bills rite now but not too many we do pay for our car and our phones . He took this very bad . He is very upset and says we cant afford it especially with this new apartment . I don't know what to do . I really think we will be fine . I have never believed in abortion but I'm so sad and i don't know what to do . He keeps changing his mind that will be fine but than he starts freaking out . I don't even know how far along i am yet . But I'm just so scared and confused . I don't know if its wrong of me to keep the baby because he doesn't want it but I don't care because in my eyes abortion is wrong . I know he wouldn't leave me but I wouldn't want him to be miserable or treat it different . I don't know I'm just having so many feelings rite now and I need some advise . He's not blaming it on me because obviously its both our faults but he says he just doesn't want to be struggling . I really need some words of encouragement rite now I don't need any bashing because even though I'm young I take care of my responsibilities and i put my priorities first . I work hard and take care of my son just like any other mother any other age .
