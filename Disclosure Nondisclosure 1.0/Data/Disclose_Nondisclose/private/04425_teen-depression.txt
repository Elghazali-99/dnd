Hi,I'm 13 and I think I have depression.I have seen a lot of thing in my life,like my pearants taking drug like crack&coke ect,they spilt up about 2 years ago and I still find it quite hard that they have,but by dad has currently come out of jail and has started drinking quite abit. I would say that I'm popular in my school like I know everyone and everyone knows me.A few months ago I use to hang around with a lot older people than me around 15 to 18,they got me into drinking,smoking and doing drugs I have even lost my virginity already, I use to cry all the time about it all,about my past and I hate myself for it!I've thought about suicide but I think how it would effect my friends&family,so I wouldn't do it and I have cut my self in the past before but I now longer don't do it, I also suffer with quite bad acne and I am self concisous about it. I wouldn't say I'm very bad like I won't have a a laugh about things&be happy at times and now I never hardley go out!I'm not sure if its just a thing that people go through?I eat a lot now and sleep a lot too.I feel worthless,unhappy,not wanted around,unliked, sometimes I just feel like it would all end and I wouldn't have to feel any emotions or anything,I'm too afraid to tell my mum or dad how I feel&that I think I have depression. 
Can someone please help, thank you x
