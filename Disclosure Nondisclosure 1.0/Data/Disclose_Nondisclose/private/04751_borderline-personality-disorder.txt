She is 40yo, 4 children, was teenage-mother, moved from home alone at age 14, abusive childhood.
She has a full time job at a cafe.
 She is member of an internet group witch involves with self-hurting.
 1st red light:----- Facebook game, addicted? ---------
Playing "a lot", according to her game-reports, often through the whole night. Encourages her children to play those games, even here son with ADHD, (is this healthy)?
How does she got spare time for her kids?
  2st red light:-----Victim, suicide attempt -----
Said she has been beaten a lot by former boyfriends, tried to kill herself when she was impregnated with one of them.
 Much superficial charm, like "you make me blush". Felt she portrayed me in a father role for her children, and me taking responsibility both for her and kids.
 She is mirroring, copying me!. She borrows my way of arranging the words, mirroring my face-expressions. The chatting became concerned short, simple texting, felt I was communication with a low-teen sometimes.
 Her statements:
- I am waiting for my prince to arrive.
- I have scared away a lot of potential boyfriends.
- I am alone with the children custody (expressed a worry over this)
  - She has NEVER has attempted to initiate contact with me yet, only answered promptly, while she is ALWAYS on her phone, chatting with others, when I see her.
 - She did a desperate move to gain my attention when I passed her by her work, I was perplexed over this , why not just call for me and I will meet up!. Anyway she could not express herself to me , only look at me with her sorry eyes, like she was trying to say something.
 After I ignored her , and she now actively showing a hate, rejection towards me.
 -- LATEST ---
When I visited her at work, she changed her personality, she got a new look/energy in here face, like a hurt child. I thought it was so strange and I ignored her again.
 She now got a "in a relationship" Facebook status , shortly after. This was a guy 15 years younger than her, she has adjusted her beauty , painted her face with "lots" of makeup.
-----------------------
.. Well I do not know what you get from this, any comments will help me through , I feel like I have abandoned a "child" to walk alone in the big world, heartbroken , but in a non conventional way ,
 thanks for reading this.
