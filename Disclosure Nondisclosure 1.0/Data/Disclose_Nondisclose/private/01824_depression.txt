Hi.  I have been on antipressants and klonapin for over 4 years.  My pdoc and I finally found a combo that works..I am diagnosed with GAD and Bipolar 2.  I am on Effexor XR 225 mg. Lamictal 200 mg. Seraquel ( pm 200 mg) and klonapin 1 mg. 3 times a day.  I have been doing great!  Recently he put me on Nuvigil due to daytime sleepiness, possibly from sleep apnea as I snore like a freight train and wake up during the night.  I have been on the Nuvigil 250 mg for a week.  Now I am noticing that my anxiety and depression are coming back....I have researched on the internet about Nuvigil and one of the side effects is anxiety and depression, so I am going to stop taking and call him.  My question is has anyone else experienced this?  I go see him in December for my med maintenance appt.  I want to add that this is a bad time of the year for me as my 19 year old son was murdered in Dec. of 1997 and his birthday is coming up on Nov. 29.  I think there have been other times, at this year, that I have been depressed and he never wants to change meds as that may have something to do with it.  I am looking into the sleep apnea. my doc says might have to do with adenoids and my left nostril is very closed up.  So much going on....anyway, really need to know if anyone has experienced this with Nuvigil.  Sorry this is so long.
