Hi
 I've been suffering from mood swings, low mood, depression and anxiety for quite a number of years and I've had a hard time with my doctors about it.
 November 2011 - I was found to have an underactive thyroid but the doctors did not put me on medication. A few months after this, my neck swelled up and I had trouble swallowing. The doctor referred me to a counselor and diagnosed me with generalised anxiety and anorexia.
 May 2013 - I was properly diagnosed with hypothyroidism and put on thyroid medication but I've not felt any different. If anything the only thing that has changed is that I no longer have constipation. I still have fatigue, depression, muscle cramps and mood issues to this day. On top of that I have lost a bit of weight.
 Present - Now that my TSH is coming back normal and that my antibodies are now reduced most of the doctors I see now have reason to believe I have something more psychological. I have been put on Citalopram and have been on this since February but I've not noticed any change. The doctor I have seen has said they can look at alternatives if the Citalopram has not made a huge difference and I'm now worried as to what next they'll do with me. I already see a counselor who is helping me with the OCD issues I have and he has said it's very difficult to differentiate between psychological depression and depression that is caused by something like hypothyroidism.
 I feel so alone with this right now. I did have a really good support network on the thyroid support forum but due to a misunderstanding I have now lost this support. My boyfriend wants to understand but has trouble with it and my grandparents now think I've ended up like this because of my diet.
 I feel like this is all in my head. :(
