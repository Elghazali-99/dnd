Hi everyone. I am a 27 year old female. for the past 6 months I have getting periodic sore throats. when this started I noticed that my left tonsil was more swollen than the right. ALWAYS (not only when I am sick) I tried to take a picture but it was hard to. . . anyway the left one is about 40% bigger maye 50% bigger than my right - it doesn't go over my airway at all really but its bothersome. its shaped like a normal tonsil but its almost has like a crevis in it . its inflamed and shaped like the top portion of a heart . . . or a "3" with a little divit or something . I have HUGE crators in the left one as well. I never see tonsil stones or anything . My breath is kinda smelly no matter how often I brush my teeth. I have NO other swollen lymphnodes that I can find. I have had a CT of my chest , and abdomen this year due to other issues and nothing found there. my CBC (blood test) was normal. But I am going to an ENT next wed to get this checked out - I am a wee bit worried about having lymphoma. Please can anyone advise me? I am extremely worried.
