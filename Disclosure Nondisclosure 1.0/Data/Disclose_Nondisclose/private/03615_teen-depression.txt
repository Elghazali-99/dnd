Everything's been setting me off lately.  I wanna punch somebody for the stupidest little thing they do.  I haven't started anything for college because I can't bring myself to even care about my life, and last night I started crying.  But crying quickly turned into hyperventilating, hysterically crying, body tremors, and I punched my door a couple times, leaving dents in the door and cuts and bruises on my hand.  I've freaked out like this before but never this bad.  I would call it a panic attack, but I wasn't panicking.  I wasn't calm, obviously.  I just felt hopeless.  Like nothing in life would change, like all I had was drugs to turn to (I haven't used any drugs in like, 6 months, alcohol in 2).  Lately I feel like I just wanna die because life's getting so bad.  And it's not even that my situation is bad, I just can't smile or be happy.  I freaked out like this for a good hour, maybe more.  I'm 18, if that would change anything... I don't know what to do.  I'm at the end of what I can think of doing.
How do I calm down or something?
 Also: has anyone ever had the problem when people want to talk to you to help you calm down, and you want to scream at them to leave but yet you want them to stay and you can't decide so you just tell them to go away?  And then the second they leave you start freaking out?
 I don't know.
Thanks for any help.
I'm lost.  I don't know what to do anymore.
