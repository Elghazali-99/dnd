My dad had a quadruple bypass in October. He fell on his back  at work in December and then started to notice a mass on his right side by his ribs in January. It showed up within a week and hasn't been growing since. It is large and tender to the touch. Pain feel like it's on the inside not the skin. Feels like someone is poking hard. The bulge is very itchy. It is a tingling numb. The bulge is much warmer than the rest of his body. Has already had a X-ray and CT which according to his doctor "it is nothing" but obviously it is something. When he lays down it moves inward and back slightly. He isn't have any problems with bowel or bladder. He has had his gallbladder removed so it's not related to that. Other history includes: diabetes type 2 (but is at a normal weight for his height and size now and for the past 5 years and doesn't take any medication for it), hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Doesn't smoke or drink. Works in a lumbar yard and driver. Any ideas would be helpful. Thank you
