Hey, I'm a 21 year old guy; For the past week or so, I've been feeling quite bloated and gassy for reasons I do not know. I haven't changed my diet or done anything different to my body but I just all of a sudden feel a burning rumble in my stomach at random times. No matter if I eat moderately or not much at all I find myself having to need to use the restroom constantly. 
 Speaking of eating, I used to eat a whole lot more before I started to feel full. Now it seems after a small meal I'm instantly filled up and I go over that then I feel my stomach cramping and a feeling of wanting to puke, but never actually having to puke. Like some sort of phlegm buildup.
 When I do use the restroom, most of the time my stool comes out normal. But on certain occasions, I feel pain in my rectum area and notice the toilet water is bright red-ish. My stool itself isn't melena or dark red, but has a mix of normal stool color blended in with bright red.
 I have also noticed that my body has random shooting pain at random times, but nowhere on my body are there any cysts or anything that looks bad. It's a muscle pain that stings more if I pinch and pull the area. And I've also noticed that after I eat something unhealthy or drink caffeine, my heart has this burning feeling that I can't quite tell if it's just my mind making it up or if it is actually heartburn.It is usually relieved after I have some Tums until I do something else unhealthy.
 The only thing before that that has happened to me is I developed bronchitis last month and went through my anti-biotics on that and felt normal afterwards. And I'm not going through any rapid weight loss, although I've lost about 20lbs the past five months. Besides that, I just have an anxiety disorder described as "severe" by my doctor.
