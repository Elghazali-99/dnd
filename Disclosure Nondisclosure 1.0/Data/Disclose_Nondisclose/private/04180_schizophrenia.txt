My sister has been having some very strange behavior for about 3 years now maybe a little longer. She lived on her own and when family would see her she would say she heard things and was very paranoid that somebody was after her trying to kill or hurt her. She filed a few police reports she kept moving in fear that somone was after her she lived in california, texas, arizona, utah,  florida and oklahoma.We haddint heard anything about her in almost 2 years we finally found her again and took her against her will to the hospital she refused to see family while there and didint accept any visitors either she was transferd to a different hospital and even one of the doctors let us know she had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. She was in the hospital for a few days but when she was released she didint want to go home with us. She refused therapy and counseling was agressive yet they released her on her own. Since she left the hospital we have only seen her once at a store. She did not speak to us or aknowledge our presence. We have not seen her since then and she has now been out of the hospital for about 3 months, we tried getting information from the hospital they were uncooperative and the police department was as well they say we can not do anything since she is over 18. We are afraid since she is on her own she could harm herself or others and without treatment she could become worse. She already wouldint eat in fear of someone poisoning her food, we feel helpless is there something we can do to help her out?     please!
