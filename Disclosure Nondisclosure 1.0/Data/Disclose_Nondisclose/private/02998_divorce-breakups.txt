I have been married june 30,2013 for 7 years, but we have been together since 1998. He use drugs when we met I stop for a year or so. We move back to his home town sept 2008. He started hanging around with his old playmates. He got back on drugs, he hid it from me for a long time. Back in oct 2012 he got real bad on them I left lights was cut off. He started sleeping with his friends wife she was on drugs too. Meth snort,shoot,smoke it. If he can get coke he would do it. Ever since all this I get theathen with divorce everytime I turn around. He always blamed everything on me. I have found needles Biden around the house. He tells me that they are not his( I guess he thinks I am stupid) he has hit me,he talks to me like a dog. He says at the computer all the time play a game and watch porn and play with his self. He hasn't slept in our bed for a week at the time. Only time he has anything to do with me is when he wants sex. It has got so bad around here till I have put hidden cameras up,do when I file for a divorce I would have proof of the drug abuse and the way he talks to me. I hate doing this I love my husband and I know the kind of person he is when he isn't on the drugs. He has went so far to have my son go pick him up something he didn't know what it was til he got back and then when he wanted some more my son wouldn't go and he treathren to jump on him but my son still wouldn't go. We have no children together and my kids are 28&20. We have a house paid for we are behind on our property taxes. I file today and he don't know it. I live in georgia and I am filing a fault divorce. I hope that I can make it though all this. I stop smoking for 13 years and started back in dec after he cheated. My nerves is do bad. I wish he would go to a long term rehab. But he thinks he had it under controll. The vebral abuse is so bad. 
I guess do yall think I could get the house cause he will end up losing it. I have proof of everything
