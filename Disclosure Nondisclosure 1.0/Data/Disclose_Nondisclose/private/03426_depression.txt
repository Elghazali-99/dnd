hi..It has been 2 months that i'm suffering from this..it happened out of sudden in march where i felt so confused and my mind went blank.i couldnt understand and concentrate what i read, wrote, or even when i talked to my friend..i had migraine for 1 week, tingling arm..so i went to neurologist but all the results came back normal ?(mri, eeg etc)
but he gave me amitriptyline to take for 1 week..my concentration a lil bit improved
 then i went to a psychiatrist and he said i have depression..he gave me escitalopram which i'm currently taking..it's been almost 1 week and i dont feel any difference..my eyes cannot focus on words that i've been reading..even when i drive i cannot focus on the cars around me..
 honestly, i dont think it's depression..cause before it happened, i was still okay - no depressing event occurred..my concentration was good and i was happy with my study..now out of nowhere it was hard for me to concentrate, understand and memorize no matter how i tried..my family and friends always told me that i'm just stress but i'm pretty sure i'm not..the only thing that stressing me out is this problem..since then i'm admit i feel down and hopeless cause i cant find the answer to my problem..
