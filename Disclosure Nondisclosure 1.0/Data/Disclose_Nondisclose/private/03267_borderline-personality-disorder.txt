So, I've been browsing through numerous books available in the bookstores and after browsing this site, I've come to the conclusion that there is more support for people who have a BPD in their life then there is for people that Actually have BPD.  Honestly, I've been browsing these topics and questions and I see numerous responses to people asking questions about their loved ones that have BPD and No responses to people With BPD asking questions and for Legitimate help problems like, "my medication is causing insomnia" (no replies) instead of, "Will my lover come back" (12 responses).  That person could have read some basic literature and figured out that us BPD's are, well, unstable.  Is there no compassion for the sufferer who wonders, "Will I get better?" (0 replies) so much as there is for the silly bumpkin who wonders why their partner with BPD left them (22 replies)?  The literature, the guide books are there but what is not provided out there is the compassion and support that it takes to truly over come this illness.  Just saying.  No offense to anyone.  Respect and best of luck to everyone out there, All sufferers of BPD alike (the ones with the illness and the loved ones that struggle with them).
