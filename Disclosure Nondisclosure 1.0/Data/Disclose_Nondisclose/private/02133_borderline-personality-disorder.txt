Do you ever feel so low to the point that you need something to distract you from the way you really feel, i often feel empty, hopeless, worthless, small, or that im a bad person, that i dont deserve certain things, angry, shallow, that my  self esteem is so low, that im fat, and ugly, that people wouldnt notice me if i was gone, that you want to cry but you dont allow yourself to. So you hurt yourself, pretending that that will make it all go away, that itll kill the pain living inside you, growing in abundance even if you dont eat, you punish yourself because you feel you deserve it and you know why but those are just excuses that you tell people when they ask, so you feel you have one? but what if you really dont know why you feel that way, and so you make things up so its ok to. What happens when your so confused and you dont know who you are, and things only happen to you? I know its selfish but most people are. When you pretend to be the victim but your also the villain for being the victim on purpose and using others for attention that you desperately seek. Do you use drugs and cut yourself to escape the reality that you deny or to feel something because you feel numb, empty and worthless, i do.  Why must i want so much attention in order to feel important or better about myself. why do i need people to do simple tasks why must I be so dependent that without other people i fall apart, Why do i need other people to help me pick up the pieces, and i cant pick them up myself. Why am i asking myself these questions on a forum where everyone else will answer them when i should be.
