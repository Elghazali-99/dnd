I have a large marble sized lump on my right thigh aswell as one smaller. I also have this on my left thigh, one is small and pea-sized and the other is slightly bigger. Some are squishy, some are a bit harder, all painless and all seem to move with the skin/fat. I had the largest one examined via ultrasound and they believe this is a lipoma, however they didn't seem willing to look at the rest of them. I am worried because I've read up on lipoma's since this (leafelt provided by a doctor), it basically states 1 in 100 people have lipomas, rarely more than two. So to me the chance of them all being lipomas seems a bit slim? 
 I also have a pea sized lump on my neck/under chin, I thought this was a lymph node which hadn't shrunk after being sick, however I've more recently realised this isn't where any of the nodes are in the neck. It is about an inch above my adams apple and slightly to the right. It is fairly soft, almost perfectly round, painless and very moveable.
 Cancer is in my family unfortunately so I therefore naturally fear the worst. I am wondering if I should go private for ultrasound and have these all checked out? Would this help determine if any are cancerous or possibly shed light on what they may be? They drive me mad and causing great anxiety in my day to day life.
