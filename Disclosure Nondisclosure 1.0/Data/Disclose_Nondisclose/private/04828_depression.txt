For the past 4 or 5 years, I've been having issues with what I think is depression. I have an issue with bottling up my emotions, so every now and then (after bottling up for awhile) I would be set off by even the smallest thing an go into a sobbing fit. This happened for around two years with fits being two or so weeks apart. Finally, I talked to my family and we decided to try the pill to balance out my hormones since I'm Polycystic. I tried it for probably six or so months and nothing changed. My doctor then put me on a generic form of Zoloft. Another couple of months went by with no change. She then added a twice daily Wellbutrin generic that I've been taking along with the Zoloft generic for nearly two years. I felt mostly the same, but the fits were happening less often. While I was on both of these, however, I still felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster. For a few days I'd be high or in between, then I'd briefly be low. These highs and lows aren't extremes though, unless the low spirals into a sobbing fit (which isn't THAT often anymore). I moved to a new town, far from the old one, a few months ago and have felt less high and more "eh" and low than ever. I've made no friends, have no car, and don't get out very often. And even though I feel "eh" and low, I feel....stable? I haven't had any sobbing fits for awhile, and I weened myself off of all my medications two months ago. So was I really depressed in the first place? I feel no different than when I was on my pills. So did I waste all that time treating something I didn't have? Last I checked, depression wasn't something that you "cure"....or is it?
