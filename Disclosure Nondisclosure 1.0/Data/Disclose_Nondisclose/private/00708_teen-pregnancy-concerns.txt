I was 12 when I had my first period (beginning of 2016) And after my first one, I ended up missing my period for five months after the first one, and after my second one came, (which was 2 months ago) I've already missed 2 months, I have gained a little bit of weight, and I've read that a gain and loss in weight can cause a irregular period.  My number one fear is getting pregnant at a young age, (like for example 13 like I am right now)
I am still a virgin, and I do take baths often, and i've also read that water can sometimes (rarely) for some reason have sperm in it, if its not clean.  And honestly my tap water isn't the cleanest, (ITS NOT GROSS DONT WORRY IT JUST DOESN'T TASTE THAT GREAT!) and i dont really understand how i could get pregnant from it.  
I have really bad anxiety when I am late on my period and i always think the worst situation (Like, i'll think i got pregnant)
I have still missed my second period and its been 2 months, if you know whats going on please help
