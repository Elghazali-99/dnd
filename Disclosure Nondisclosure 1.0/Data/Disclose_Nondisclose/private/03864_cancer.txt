Ok, I guess the title sounds stupid because nobody can diagnose me over the internet. But I'm worried. Mortified would be a better word. I've just turned 21 years old and am expecting a potential cancer diagnosis over the coming weeks. About a month ago I noticed that my right tonsil was swollen, so I immediately visited my doctor the next day.. he had a look, said it was nothing to worry about and sent me on my way. two weeks later, I visited again complaining that it hadn't gone down and I could feel a hard lymph node in my neck so he scheduled me for some blood tests. Two weeks later (today) I returned to find out the results of my blood tests and to discuss this tonsil further (the lymph node in my neck is now bigger and can be felt easily.) The doctor is scheduling me to see an ENT specialist within the next 1-2 months so I can find out what's going on here. I saw an ENT specialist about 5 months ago for an unrelated issue and nothing was detected then, but still. He said it's "definitely not cancer" because my blood tests haven't shown any abnormalities and lymphoma always shows an abnormality in the blood. I'm scared. If it's not cancer why would he send me to a specialist? My only symptoms over the last few weeks are that I keep getting coughs/colds. I will fight them off, then immediately get another one... but whatever. This lymph node in my neck though DOES NOT HURT. Doesn't that all but confirm that I'm totally screwed? I'm really in the dark here so if anybody can shed any sort of light on this it would be great. What are the actual odds that I could have cancer? I don't know the statistics and I can't find any. I really am going out of my mind here.
