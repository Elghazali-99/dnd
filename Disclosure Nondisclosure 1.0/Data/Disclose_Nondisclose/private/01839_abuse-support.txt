I love my family more than life itself and when I was 12, my dad sexually harassed me. I had counseling and social services were once involved but I had lied saying I was over exaggerating what had happened for the sake of my family not falling apart. Four years later, my dad and mom are still together. I wouldn't say they're happy, though. My dad is, but my mom and the rest of us think my dad is just ignorant. It seems all he cares about is my little four year old sister and the rest of us are just here. I don't normally talk to my dad unless he needs something such as doing the dishes or cleaning. Sometimes we joke around but it's rare and it only happens for a split second of the day. No matter what happens or how good my day is, at the end of it I'll always remember him as a father that broke my heart. I repeatedly ask myself, why me? He doesn't treat any of his other kids (3 others) the way he once treated me and what he did to me. And I know that for a fact. It was ONE mistake he made and will never make again that's just how he looks at it. He doesn't acknowledge how it's affected me. I'm hurting but also scarred and I'm scared to tell mom because it's my family and I don't want to ruin how happy my siblings may be over something that happened four years ago. My mom doesn't know I still think about it and to just re open a case that was "dealt" with just seems like I want to do it for attention. I really don't want my family to be torn apart for an incident that happened in the past, but it hurts me more and more everyday.
