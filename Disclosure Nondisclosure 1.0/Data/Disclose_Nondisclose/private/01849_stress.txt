I been trying to get my medical records for the last 3 weeks I sign released and everything to be sent to me and to new gas doctor they said they sent them on 8th but never git them don't take over a week to get 20 miles away. I have been getting the turnaround every time I call them they upset me and my side where lump is has been in pain for 2 days now. On release form never mention money for the records n called over 10 times about this until I called them lame greedy doctors money came up for each copy she said she out them in mail yesterday again just lies so I am going up there tomorrow. She said they will be ready so have to see are they hiding something?? Cuz I been sick since Oct I just have a feeling they are.. they only sent my family doctor one page n I have lots of pages one page saying I have enlarge spleen enlarged liver that's it nothing else and I had blood work and a few other stuff done. I can't keep calling them they are stressing me out!! I just want my records I don't under stand why they are giving me a runaround. Still fell they are hiding something about my health could that be possible?
