MY WHOLE LIFE PEOPLE HAVE TREATED ME A CERTAIN WAY. I NEVER HAD A BAD CHILDHOOD OR WAS REALLY MADE FUN OF, BUT THIS WAS DUE TO MY NOT TALKING TOO MUCH. I WAS FRIENDS WITH THE POPULAR CROWD, BUT COULD ALWAYS TELL THAT OTHER PEOPLE SOCIALIZED IN WAYS THAT MADE THEM SEEM MORE AWARE AND ADULT AT TIMES. I NEVER REALY THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I WAS IN MY FIRST YEAR OF TRADE SCHOOL. THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE I HUNG OUT WITH HAD MADE HINTS AT THE LACK OF MY INTELLIGENCE(NOT KNOWING HOW DUMB I REALLY WAS) THEN AFTER THAT I REALLY PAYED CLOSE ATTENTION TO MY SOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND HOW WELL I CAN INTERACT WITH OTHERS. IT WAS HORRIBLE. THIS EXPLAINS A LOT ABOUT HOW WHILE IN SCHOOL THE KIDS WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TEACHERS. 
 AFTER 4 YEARS OF PAYING ATTENTION TO MY HABITS I HAVE COMFIRMED THAT IM WELL BELOW AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE. I CANT SOCIALIZE WITHOUT POEPLE THINKING SOMETHINGS WRONG WITH ME. THEY THINK SOMETHINGS WORNG WITH ME BECAUSE I CARY MYSELF IN A WAY THAT HIDES MY TRUE INTELLIGENCE. I COME ACROSS AS A REAL ******* BECAUSE I AVOID PEOPLE AND ALWAYS TRY TO CUT CONVERSATIONS SHORT OUT OF FEAR OF SOMEONE FINDING OUT IM STUPID.
 I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE IS STUPID AND KNOWS IT?
 AND FOR ALL OF THOS EOUT THERE THAT THINK TELLING ME IM NOT STUPID WILL HELP... YOUR JUST PATRONIZING ME.
