Hi,
I have been into a relationship for past 10 yrs. I am not married though yet. Me and my Boyfreind has sometimes problems when i felt  that he doesnt care for me. He approached his mom to marry me and his mother took one yer to respond him for his marriage with me. Anyhow she came to my home and things sorted out. By that time i applied to abroad for some research program and i wanted to go over there. I went abroad after talking to his parents about marriage. Things were gud so far. Now when i reached aborad after 3 months i got contract for another 3 yrs to carry on my research . I told my BF abt that and he said its okay i f u want to carry out, but now there will be problem. And time passed by and we had a regular fight over it . I was telling him to apply to that country so that we can live together , But in his opinion he was afriad to change his job and country and above all when his mother got to know about that m she cried infront of him and asked him not to move as they wll be alone if he moves abroad . She brainwashed his mind and now he don't wants to come abroad. this made me mad and then while talking to him i shouted on him a lot. 
 Now it has been one yr again and the things are more worst as his  mother now says that this girl doesnt repects you and she will not respect us either. If she will come back to our house then also she will not adjust , And my bf asks me the same question that his mother ask to him about me. Now his mother has created a barrier in between us. I am far away frm him and most of the thime times we are just fighting over his mom apprehensions about me.
 He says that he dont want to stuck in between his mom and me. So he wants me to understand all his problems. I dont know what to do now?? How to proceed further as i am afraid that his mother is ***** . Even if i will go back and marry him , his mother wil be there with us and my BF says that in any case he wont leave his house.
