I was diagnosed with depression at age 18, and have tried almost all kinds of antidepressants, from SSRI's (which don't help), tricyclics (nortriptyline as an add-on), and SNRI's (Effexor XR gave me severe tachycardia and anxiety, so I switched to Cymbalta which kinda help but seems to bring out the sadness in me even more), and atypicals like Remeron, Wellbutrin and trazodone. I had 8 sessions of ECT but didn't seem to have much improvement. Even since I became pregnant I had to get off all antidepressants on the order of my husband, and with the extra pregnancy fatigue due to hormone surge, I can hardly open my eyes everyday and the sadness is ever present. I got desperate and had a urine neurotransmitter level test done and found out that my GABA level was twice as high as the normal value while the glycine level was 3 times as high as the normal upper range value, both being major inhibitory neurotransmitters.  To my surprise, my norepinephrine is high, dopamine is normal and serotonin slightly low.  I am currently researching for a drug that would lower GABA level and seem to have found imipramine and desipramine (its metabolite) to be GABA transaminase agonists according to an article by Cohen published in 2002 regarding their use for infantile autism.  Are there any drugs that will by any mechanism of action decrease GABA?  Thanks.  As for the high glycine level, I also suspected NKH (non-ketotic hyperglycinemia) but my plasma amino acid level of it came back slightly low, but I will confirm that with a genetic test just to rule out the possibility of having NKH.  My main concern now is how to lower GABA.  Any comment would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
