Hi everyone.
I just thought I'd start by saying this is a fantastic website full of great advice.
My story:  I was sexually abused by my father for many years as a child, and I've been back and forward to councellors for years.  I am at a happy place in my life at the moment as I am getting married soon to the most wonderful, caring lover a girl could ask for.  But my problem is I'm afraid of affection. Sure I love kissing and hugging him, but I tend to pull away when he goes to kiss or hug me.  We have "played around" with each other a few times before but we both agreed to stay virgins until the wedding night.  I want to give him love and affection, I really do.  But a part of me feels so dirty and wrong.  I guess I am just really worried about the wedding night because I want it to be one of the best experiences of my life.  But a part of me has grown up thinking that sex and affection towards the opposite sex is a bad, disguisting and dirty thing.  We are both christians, and in a way we were both brought up to believe that sex is a really bad thing if you are not married.  I haven't been to a church service yet were it explains that sex is a beautiful loving act.  Sex just isn't spoken about in church.
But yeh what I'm basically saying is how do I learn to enjoy sex and affection? 
I feel really bad for my hubby 2 b, but he has been very understanding of everything, and knows about my abuse.  He has told me many times that we won't do anything that I am not comfortable with.  I really do love him and I want to please him on the night, and into my marraige.  I want to believe that sex can be a beautiful thing.
