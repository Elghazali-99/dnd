I'm a 15 year old girl living in Pennsylvania. I believe I'm depressed. I've spoken to my parents about it and they're so helpful in giving me ideas to make me feel better: get outside (I've joined the track & field team), go out with friends a little more, and take vitamin B. Mostly everything seems to help, but once in a while, I go back under and it feels miserable. It's usually when I'm just thinking about the way I used to feel and how it's always going to be a part of me. Sometimes I wish I didn't ever tell my parents because that made it an issue by itself whereas if I had just kept it quiet, it might have passed and I wouldn't have ever thought about it. I find myself always evaluating my feelings whenever something happens and I just don't want to remember it ever happened at all, because remembering it brings it back. I wish there was a way to just wipe out my memory of the whole situation and move on with my life because I feel like it would help. That being said, I don't regret telling my parents, because they've helped a lot and I know talking to someone was the right thing to do. 
My symptoms are that I just don't feel like there's anything I love in the world anymore. When I'm alone at home on a weekend, I find myself not knowing what to do with myself and end up watching TV or netflix. I'm not suicidal, but once in a while I think about what I would miss if I did happen to die, and I come up blank. Not even my sister whom I love, not even my parents. I know I love them and I want to stay alive but sometimes I think "what's the use" if I'm always going to feel this miserable. What's the use if feeling like this doesn't let me have fun? Does anyone out there have ideas or solutions for me? Any help would be very much appreciated.
