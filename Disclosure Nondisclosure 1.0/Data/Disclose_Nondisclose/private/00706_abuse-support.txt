I am wondering if my mother is abusive.  She calls me stupid, dumb, and says  things like, "If you were smart, you wouldn't..."  She says, "I am not sh...!"  She constantly nags about what's is wrong in the house when I am there, among other things that I will refrain from saying.  I 27 yers old.I can remember her saying very mean things to me when I was a pre-teen; this is when it started.  I never really questioned it.  I did write about it a lot in my diary, but I thought it was just I'll personailities conflicted.   
 In addition, I am currently in an emotionally abusive relationship with my child's father and I have been doing research on emotional abuse because of this.  I figured that it usually comes from romantic relationships, but thinking back, I remember how hurt I was when my mother used to call me names and yell extremely loud at me.  I know that I am not a saint, but this has affected my social relationships.  I feel very isolated from my peers.  My self-esteem is almost gone.  Now, it seems that the teenhood experience has resulted in being in an emotionally abusive relationship with a man that I partly resent. 
 I don;t know if I'm being overly emotional or is mother really emotionally abusive?
