2 days ago a therapist told me i have depression and abit of anxiety from trauma
 a year and abit ago i pretty much was on a roll looking after my body til one day my dad said go get the clothes off the line ... so i did and my arm dislocating for the 2nd time leaving me in the rain unable to move 
later that night i got fixed up by drs but ... that following morning i woke up with numbness in the back of my skulll
so for the 3 months i tryed to get drs to help me but they were not sure and sent me home   ... oh yeah they said take zoloft because its prob panic attacks 
3 months have passed and i was pretty much a vegetable thinking i was gonna die 
then  i went to a chiropractors  he scanned me and showed me that from my arm my c1 was off tilt 
he fixed up the numbness in 3 weeks  i got off zoloft but ... for the year it felt like something was missing  
2 weeks ago i strained my neck feeling that pain again and it sent me into a fit 
iduno what happened but i went crazy  
the chiropractor fixed it up again but ... i saw a therapist this time about the  emotionless issues 
i felt like it was hard to express emotions these days
she said i have  depression and abit of anxiety  and now this is my 2nd day on 10 mg lexopro  
i feel relaxed but the pilll wouldnt of worked this quick 
so im saying im relaxed from the pain going away 
can someone give me a hand out of this rutt ????
