so I was on here about a month ago, I just thought it might make me feel better to get off my chest how I truely feel, and yeah dont get me wrong I did feel better but yet its back again... I have this non stop feeling of anxiety, I feel like noone cares yet I have the best family support I could ask for, I have lost all self confidence when I used to be fun, outgoing now I feel quilty to smile and laugh everyones kinda realised months ago I've basically lost myself but I cant get this feeling tht I will never feel better again, i still havnt been to see a doctor and basically thats just out of embarrasment Im a young girl with great family I have no reasons whatsoever to feel like this?? like ive said in my previous post Ive now wlked out of two jobs and i have been left umployed for 6 months now, yeah of course thats gonny bring anyone down self esteem ect but even when I think back before that I still have this feeling, is depression there 24/7 because sometimes i feel fine and then give me a week or so and im back to this?? everyone around me is totally worried but I dont even know how to tell them how I feel and when they ask, i just crumble to tears. Also .. other issue possibly a main issue is alcohol, when i drink even one sip too much thats me I am an absolute totally different crazy person I have black outs I remember nothing and wake up to be told what happened, is this maybe all related but the drinking issues gone on for years now and i have finally realised that im jst one of those people who cant drink but its easier said than done in this day in age. i could go on for ever just typing how i feel whats going on in my head yet when it comes to telling someone i just feel like a complete idiot??? i know firstly see a doctor but im just scared to do tht at the moment but i cannot continue this way much longer
