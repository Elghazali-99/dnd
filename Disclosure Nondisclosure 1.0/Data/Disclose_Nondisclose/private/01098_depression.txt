History: been hospitalized twice but no clear diagnosis has ever been made other than ADD and Depression. *suspected mood disorder or sensory modulation disorder.
 I've been depressed since 12 but this is just out of control. I can't get to school because I can't wake up and if I do I'm fatigued all day. I constantly feel depressed, like my suffering won't end. I take two vyvanse during the day just to keep my head up and my mood raises for a good 2-3 hours only to drop again, lower than before sometimes. I have terrible headaches at the end of the day and often times find myself irritable. I don't even think the adavan works, if anything I am just slower but feel like ****. and I can't enjoy sex because I can never ejaculate. 
 I often times feel numb or careless, I value almost nothing in life. Nothing's fun unless I take vyvanse while doing it, otherwise I just rest in bed and try to shutdown my mind. Suicidal thoughts occur every night, I just want my hell to end. 
 Can anyone tell me, anyone ... What the **** Is wrong with me?
