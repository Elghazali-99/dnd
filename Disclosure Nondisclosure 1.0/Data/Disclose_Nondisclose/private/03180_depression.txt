Lexapro 
I am on 40 mg of Lexapro and 2mg of Klonopin as of last year this time when I went thru Divorce with my second husband. Prior to that I was on 20 mg with Klonopin 2mg until it worked not well and felt worse.
 My anxiety depression worsens I noticed in fall due to SAD syndrome. The anxiety of under control this way but my doctor often takes time to refill the Klonopin therefore to not run out of Klonopin I skip it and take it every second day or third day. 
By the time third day comes without Klonopin wafer even though I take 40 mg of Lexapro my depression worsens and my anxiety worsens and roaming of thought about what is the point becomes prevalent, which is relieved if I take Klonopin 2 mg at least every second day. Therefore additional anxiety that she believes that Lexapro 40 mg should take care of anxiety and stop the need for Klonopin is present and brings us additional unneeded worry. Well weight is unavoidable for most since night eating for emotional comfort is what these meds often make you crave. Or they relax you enough to stop exercising. 
Question is if skipping daily dose of Klonopin Wafer 2mg and taking it every second or third day is the way to continue since withdrawal by the third day brings on severe sense of hopelessness and rumination of negative self talk and settles once i take the Klonopin Wafer?
