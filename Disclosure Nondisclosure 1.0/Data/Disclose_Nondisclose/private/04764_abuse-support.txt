I got married 2 years ago, called my wife from India.  On the day of marraige she wanted to think and I had to cancel marraige.  Then she calls cousin to beat my father on the basis of dowry. when i refused for marraige she begged and begged. we got married, her true color came and refused to talk with family not only that she would pressure me for not talking with family.  Meantime she also started complaining that I do not saitsfy her sexually.  She would go to my friends house and come at midnight. she refuses to clean or cook at home.  She uses my money, saves her but do not tell me how much she earns and what she does.  On top of that she tells me I am not earning enough and I am eating her money.  She sends money to her brothers education and supports him by taking care of some of his expense.  Two days ago she called domestic shelter hotline for emotional and financial abuse because She transffered some money in her account and I asked her why did she do that?  I am confused what should I do?  How do I handle this situation?  I do want to save marraige but not at the cost of gaoing to Jail.
