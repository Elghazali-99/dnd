I have been on 200 mg Zoloft, 200 mg lamictal, wellbutrin and 3 mg Xanax daily for 3 years. before welbutrin I was on abilify and it worked very well but it was unaffordable so doc changed it to welbutrin , which I never thought worked. 
I started feeling down and anxious and asked the dr to change me back to abilify since I had new ins that will cover it . Instead she weaned me off the Zoloft in only 9 days with instructions to start pristiq 50 mg daily after the nine days. She failed to tell me the hell I would go through weaning off Zoloft. I'm afraid to sleep in the same room with my wife due to the nightmares and that I might hit her in my sleep. I also feel like I have mini shocks through my body, very anxious and down. I used to really like my doctor but now she is so busy our visits are 3 - 5 minutes. appointments with new drs are 6 months wait. I'm sick of all this and ready to get off all these meds since I've started off the zoloft. Can anyone advise me how?
My original diagnosis was major depression, ptsd and bipolar.
