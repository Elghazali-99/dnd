Hi,
 I've been choking since a year now. It is thick clear, sometimes white mucus that literally gets stuck to your hand. When choking it out it gets stuck and makes it hard to be breathe. In between I've had episodes where for two weeks I vomited anything I ate but that got better with time. For about 3 months now, the choking has gotten worse; I can't swallow simple things like carrots or even fennel seeds and end up gagging them back out. For a week now, I've had a tight feeling in my chest and neck.
 The doctor ordered a barium swallow test but it came back negative. I was asked to take Ranitidine (Zantac) and Esomeprazole (Nexum) in case it was a case of GERD; I was even prescribed Montelukast Sodium (Myteka) in case it was an allergy that was causing the choking. I've used nasal drops because one doctor also suggested it could have been caused by Sinusitis. None of the above helped. I have been taking Pregabalin (Lyrica) and found that it helped decrease the extremity of the pain in my chest but the choking still remains.
 Could this be cancer? If not, what should I do?
