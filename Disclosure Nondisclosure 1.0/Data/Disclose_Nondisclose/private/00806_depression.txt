I've  been having some depression/anxiety issues for a little over a year now. This all seem to came about after I quit drinking cold turkey after several years. I'm 24, whether the depression is related to my drinking or not I don't know. It has changed forms on me so many times from panic attacks, to excessive crying, to feeling unreal, but all lately I feel like I completely lost ALL my feelings, and am afraid I will never be the same or have them back. I feel unreal and like I'm just going through the motions, and all my actions are just out of habit. It is so hard to explain to anyone how I feel Since I still can laugh and joke around, but there is no feeling behind it, if that makes sense? I have tried several anti depressants, and when I took them they made me feel emotionally numb like this among other side effects which is why I quit taking them. I have researched quite a bit about chemical dependency, depression, the whole works. There was a small stretch of time when I was feeling better (not normal, but better) but this inability to gain pleasure or joy is the worst feeling yet. Did I cause premanant irreversable damage from my 4-5 years of heavy drinking? Or is this just depression resulting from it. I have seen many Dr.s and a few psychs. and I just never can get a clear cut answer as to their best guess what is going on. They just throw me some new meds and send me on my way. Has anyone on here been seriously anhedonic and found the right med and had their life come back and feel like them old selves? Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!!!
