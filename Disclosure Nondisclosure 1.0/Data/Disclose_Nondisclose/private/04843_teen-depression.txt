I really need help.
Lately or really for the past couple of months ive been feeling like nothing is right, i feel like im the ugliest and worst person in the world, my friends tell me im not but i just wont belive them idk why. i havent been able to sleep and for some reason i feel like im not really in control of my life or something, like im just watching myself do stuff throughout the day. Ive been totally outta it and i cant seem to enjoy the things i used to. i just dont feel the same motivation to do anything throughout the day. i feel like im just i dnt know how to explain it. at random times i will just break down crying for almost no reason. im always putting myself down thinking everything is my fault. i always have a negative outlook on life. i dnt feel the same. and i have a problem with self-mutilation. i always feel the need to hurt myself, like i deserve it and that i always screw things up. i feel like i should just give up on life. and i think about suicide daily..(but i wont kill myself i just fell like i should). so i think i might have depression but i dnt really know so i need to know.
Do i have depression?
or is it all in my head?
