I was separated from my wife about 2 years ago (She ran off with a long time friend of mine). I got a  very bad ulcer and had a prescription happy dr that put me on Ulcer meds, Zoloft, Ativan, pain killers, and Xanax. I was in the ER at least twice a week with anxiety and panic attacks. I flipped out in the hospital thinking I couldn't breathe and I was considered a danger to myself. Put on a 5150 hold. Put in a treatment center. They told me I was mentally healthy and sent me home 2 days later.  About a year went by and I got much better. Kicked all of my meds and the ulcer healed up. I met a great girl and had been dating her for about 8 months, we lived together also. She just broke everything off and wants me out of the house in a week. She's not the type that needs anyone to feel good, and I am (Sad to admit). And I smoked too much. The last 5-6 days have been so depressing. I'm scared to get back on meds but feel like I may need it. It was a battle to kick them in the first place. Can't get this girl off my mind and the fear of being alone again is hell. Lost it all again and don't know what to do. My leg won't stop bouncing, I have an anxiety attack about every 5 mins. So scared the panic attacks are going to come back any second. Don't even know where to start looking for help..
