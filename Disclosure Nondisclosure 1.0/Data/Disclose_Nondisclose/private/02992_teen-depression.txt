I'm a 17 year old male and i have have probably the worst week of my life. I am not able to see my parents because of my grandmother which whom i was adopted by when i was 10. My parents have had a bad past about drugs and a lot of other things. I always wished that i could be a normal kid and have parents that were always there for me and cared a lot for me. Recently I've been going to see my dad and i basically got "caught". So my grandmother and my aunt sat down and talked to me for about two hours in my living room. Saying all of these bad things about my father, that he is the devil, no good for me, will get me into trouble, etc... They do not understand him like i do. He is actually quite different then what most people think. I love him a whole lot of course but how could they try to keep him away from me. My ex girlfriend was out there with me when we got caught and i talked to her mother about the situation. She understood me completely. The main reason why i am having such a hard time right now is because my father has cancer. So he was getting chemotherapy and when i saw him he was almost bald. Almost made me cry on the spot. They just do not understand how much i love him and how much he loves me. Now me and my ex girlfriend are fighting and everything is just going down hill from there. I just don't know what to do, that's why i am typing all this out. I have been hiding it for the longest time and now it's time to let it out. Please help!
