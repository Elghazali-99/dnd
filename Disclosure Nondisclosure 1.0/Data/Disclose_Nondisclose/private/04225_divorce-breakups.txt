My husband and I are in a very bad custody battle for our 3 year old son who has a severe heart condition. We have been married for 3 and a half years. My husband used to smoke and sell marijuana severely right up until we got married (which was 3 and a half years ago). He testified in court that he hadn't smoked it in six to eight years and has never sold it. I did get one affidavit that stated she witnessed him smoking it and also selling it as well as me never using it (as I never did which is why I made him quit or I would not marry him). I also put specific dates in my affidavit as well. He also condtradicted his own affidavit on the stand as well with his time frame for smoking the drug by stating he hadn't since he was a teenager. I also have several affidavits from my co-workers who have seen his car at the bar recently as of late. We are waiting for the judge to make a decision as to physical custody. My husband states he is out of money and cannot afford his lawyer and wants to settle on 50/50 both physical and joint so he doesn't have to pay child support. He cannot even take care of himself let alone a child with a heart condition. He lives with his mother. Has anyone gone through anything like this or have any advice? I have a lawyer and am doing fine financially, but will fight for my son to be in a safe place. Please help....thank you.
