Hi I am a 46yr old female. I have been having the depo jab for 9 yes now so don't have periods. I have been having hot flushes feeling dizzy and faint panic attacks pain in right upper arm and shoulder feel constantly tired. Am having blood test to see if starting change as my Dr thinks. But since I can't go by periods not sure if starting or not. Have not felt well for a while now had blood tests and ultra sounds all came back clear except cholestral high low vitamin d which am on tablets for both now. But my ESR was up to 48 and Dr not happy so am waiting for results of another blood test. What would be normal for a women my age ? They don't know why I am feeling I'll. Twice been shopping and needed  first aider as came over hot then cold and shaking I had on another 4/5 panic attacks in 2 and a half hours am getting very frustrated now I car for my partner who is 45 and has suffered 2 strokes since 2008 I can't afford to be I'll can anyone plse help give some ideas if my ESR could be a poss indication that something is wrong. Thank you
