Quick background - I gave my 3 year old daughter away 2 weeks ago. I don't know how I'm suppose to feel. I couldn't afford to look after her any longer and I had grown resentment towards her. My feeling are not natural. I had her when I was 17, her father went to jail and I was left on my own to raise her. My current partner has never taken to her she not to him. We recently brought a house and my feelings towards her worsened. I know I did the right thing for my daughter she is now with a family who have known her since birth and have accepted her as their own. She is happy. 
 Myself on the other hand, well, I am angry and sad. Angry at my current partner, I feel he is insensitive. Angry at myself, for not being a better mother, wondering if my life would be different if I wasn't with my current partner. Feeling I need to breath, I need freedom, I need space. I don't want to be responsible for him, picking him up, picking up his clothing ect. I don't know what to do! 
 I am concerned about my mental state. I'm up and down everyday. My birth mother has chronic depression and refuses to be medicated. I know I'm getting some of the traits. Crying, even before I have my daughter away, anger, feeling trapped. 
 But what do I do, is it my partner? Is he making me depressed. Am I manipulating the situation do that he is the problem, is it really me? And I'm in denial. I don't have anyone to talk to, it's not safe for anyone to know I don't have my daughter due to get psychotic father. 
 Any ideas or suggests welcome. Please feel free to speak your mind. I'm numb at this point in time.
