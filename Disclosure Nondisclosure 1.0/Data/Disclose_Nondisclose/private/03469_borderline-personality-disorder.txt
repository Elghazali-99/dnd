Dear friends who have BPD your valuable insights wanted , 
I was in a 4 month relationship mainly long distance with a girl who increasingly used to emotionally abuse me everyday though i was patient with her and loved her . As a chronic depressive myself what upset me more was not the daily emotional abuse , silent treatment , blaming me for everything etc as soon  i learnt not to take it personally and that it is due to BPD internal turmoil . But i was deeply upset because she was not even ready to see a link on borderline disorder or see a therapist and also because she never used to empathise with my depression .  I was getting increasingly depressed and by mutual consent she told me " when i am ready to support her i should call her " . 
Suffering from major depression now for a week but still i want to know how is she . In BPD forums for families they talk of No contact as people with BPD think differently it seems . What should i do ? Its not that i think i can be again in love but i want to know how she is . Can i casually call her ? Will it be triggering considering BPD individuals see only in extremes  ?
 any advice is very useful . Thanks
