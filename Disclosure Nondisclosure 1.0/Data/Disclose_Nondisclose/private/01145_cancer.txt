Background 
I am 33 yo and 25 pounds overweight. Two years ago I had lower abdominal and lower back pain, therefore I did endometriosis tests, pap smear, CA 125 in June 13. All were fine. Then I was diagnosed with spastic colon following a colonoscopy in July 13 
I also have a little issue with T4 in my spine, nothing serious, but I was told it could develop to a disc. 
My mom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 4 months back. 
My Grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer. she was 75. 
 Symptoms 
2 months ago I started waking up to mid back pain 1-2 hrs after I sleep. This happens once or twice a week. I would go for the whole week having no symptoms at all, then the pain would wake me up in the middle of the night, and I wonâ€™t be able to go back to sleep. The pain feels like a belt of burning & stabbing, it radiates to other regions in my back. The pain usually persist for a day. Then again there will be no symptoms for a few days. 
I did some blood and urine tests (blood count, blood differential, Enzymes, clinical tests of iron calcium potassium protein urea and uric acid.. etc, Thyroid TSH sensitive, and tumor markers CA 15-3 and CA 19-9).The results were perfectly fine. 
My PA refused to do MRI or CT Scan because my blood and urine tests are fine and there are no other symptoms such as weight loss, abdominal pain or nausea. She said it must be stress. I am not a doctor but stress doesn't wake you up in the mid of the night with a stabbing pain. pls help 
Thanks
