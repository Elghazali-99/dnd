My husband and I are separated after 12 years of marriage. I am devastated at the loss of our family and at the same time, I'm the one who initiated the separation. He was and still is emotionally and verbally abusive. Not only to me, to the children as well. I just recently found evidence of him having a relationship with another woman and he has been bragging to mutual friends about the girl. It's embarrassing and very hurtful that he'd be so open about it while we are still married and a week ago, he told me he would do anything to get his family back together. He later told me he only said that because he thought that is what he should say to make me feel better. I don't want to be with him anymore due to the amount of abuse I've endured and he keeps treating me like I'm nothing. The thought of him with another woman, especially after I found out he possibly wants more kids ( I got my tubes tied after our third because he said he didn't want more) hurts unbearably. Does anyone have any advice or tips to embrace reality and cone through this positively and stronger? The amount of betrayal and anger and hurt and sadness I feel from this whole process is tremendous.
