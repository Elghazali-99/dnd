I'm only two months shy of my 18th birthday. I've had a fever ranging between 99-100 for at least two weeks now, every single day (my baseline temperature is 97.9 - at least, that's the last normal measure my doctor recorded 6 months ago). The fever isn't what initially sent me to the doctor, but some other symptoms I've been having for the past month and a half. Some of the most noticeable ones include 
 - aches and pains in my upper back around the ribs and sharp chest pains 
- fatigue and shortness of breath 
- deep, dull aches that come and go in my shins and forearm bones (worse at rest), and occasionally joint/hip pain 
- throbbing headaches that at first presented on one side only, usually in one particular spot above the ear 
- deep muscle twitches
 These symptoms are really come-and-go. The head pains, for example, were bad for about a month, and then as of the last week or two they've started to subside a bit. The aches in my forearms is a bit worse though. I don't have all these symptoms all at once, except for the fatigue. They kind of move around day by day, hour by hour. Nothing is really constant, other than the fact that I feel "something" usually every day. There are other things too, like blurry/double vision and bad lower back pain, but I chalk it up to other problems, such as my poor eyesight and my endometriosis (both of which I've had for many years).  
 I just went to my doctor today to get results back from some lab work I got done a week and a half ago. Everything was normal except for a low ANA screen - nonspecific (don't know what that means) and a slightly, slightly elevated type of protein (too insignificant to worry really, she didn't go in depth). There were no swollen nodes she could feel, and my basic blood counts were normal. No rheumatoid arthritis, no lupus or anything like that. No infections like Epstein Barr either. She's still worried about my fever though, and ordered an echocardiogram for a slight heart murmur. She told me today that in two weeks if my fever doesn't resolve, she'd like to see me again and go down the path of more extensive testing, starting with chest x-rays and a blood culture, an MRI of the brain if that doesn't reveal anything, and even a possible lumbar puncture (I internally freaked out a bit when I heard that one). I told her "I'm sure my fever will probably go down in the next two weeks, right?" and she just smiled and said "well, let's hope so."
 Should I be nervous? I'm sure more serious diseases like Leukemia have been ruled out because of my normal CBC, but I just want to know what the heck is wrong with me. I feel like these two weeks are going to drag on so slowly. I don't like not knowing things. I'm sorry if this isn't the right forum to post in. 
 Thanks.
