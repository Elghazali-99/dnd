I'm a 15 year old Italian girl. During the last few years i've been seeing a number of psychologists because of my self-destructing tendencies and overall behaviour. I have been self-harming for two years and suicide happens to be one of the most recurrent thoughts for me. 
At the same time I behave perfectly normal around people, if not a little over the top. There are times in which I love myself and times in which I find myself disgusting, I hate people or love them, I change mood constantly, bursting out and screaming at friends or family. I laugh or giggle inapropriately at random times. Once I saw a woman die in hospital and had to keep myslelf from laughing. Then I fall into depression and try to hurt myself in all ways I can (cutting, banging, burning, scratching, smoking, snorting pills).
I know there must be something wrong with my brain. I am constantly paranoid about little things, and my moods change radically in no time.
 I've read both about Bipolar and Borderline Personality disorders. The main difference is the length of the depressive or manic moods, right? And the fact that Borderline might diminish with time (or actually be cured), is that true?
 Could I have borderline? My psychologist doesn't seem inclined to diagnosing me anytime soon, should I try meeting a psychiatrist?
