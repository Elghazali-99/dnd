I'm 20yrs old and I'm bleeding now (June 1, 2014) I've experienced spotting at night before my period (May 30, 2014). (May 31, 2014) I started bleeding until now. But my bleeding is very light. Not that light though. Im still using a tampon. But my normal period is heavy. I dont know if its my menstrual bleeding or implantation bleeding. Had clots on it and im experiencing cramps. But the night of my spotting (May 30, 2014) I didnt sleep at all because I got scared of the spottig. The next day im bleeding. Does stress affect the flow? 
 Had unprotected sex during my period (April 30, 2014) that was my 5th day and its like im about to finish my period when we did it because after that my period stopped. Im aware that ovulation starts after 14 days of your last period. And my menstual cycle is REGULAR. 
 I took a pregnancy test (May 28 and May 30 morning before my spotting occured) I used first mornin urine and still negative. Can you help me? I'm scared and not yet ready to be pregnant.
