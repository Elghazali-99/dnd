Hi I was diagnosed with depression in August of last year. I was on antidepressants until around February. I was on citrolopram for many months and on my last I was moved into something that didn't agree with me. Very lightheaded, vomiting. Anyway, my doctor thought it would be best to get it all out of my system and wait for those symptoms to subside until returning. 
 The symptoms stopped. I have always been very reluctant to share how I feel with a doctor and I'm easily embarrassed about being depressed. I felt like, I heard about it, but it didn't happen to people like me. So I haven't returned to the doctor. And I'm feeling quite nervous about it. I will make an appointment to go next week and I will follow it through. But I get their and I clam up. I panic. I never used to be like this. I was once so laid back and confident. 
 I find that the feeling of hopelessness is the strongest whilst having pms. I get extremely nauseous. It's not the normal so boobs and emotional. I feel the urge to clean a lot. Only in that time. And it subsides after. 
 I'm just wondering if you have any ideas or if you have or do experience this? 
 Thanks
