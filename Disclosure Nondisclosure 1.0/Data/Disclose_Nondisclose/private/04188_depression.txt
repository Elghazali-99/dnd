This is very hard for me to say... I am not one of those people that can easily explain my feelings and **** so... 
 i have never been very social.
I have basically discarded my relationships with my friends for selfish reasons and now i feel it is too late to apologize to them for my incompetence because they have already gained new friends and don't need me anymore.
My depression was mainly caused by my addiction to video games which started in 2007 (6th grade). Now i don't have any video games to play partially because of my parents taking them away and recently this year my ps3 console got the yellow light of death which basically means that it died. it was pretty much my only social connection with my friends. i only now realize that my depression was caused by my excessive game playing because instead of gaming now, i watch anime and since i am not communicating with my friends while doing it, My lonelyness is increasing rapidly. I am like a spiral continuously going downward. I believe that it is too late to change anything. I am not very good at making friends, and that fact has only increased over the years.
The most troublesome thing is that its hard to fix something that has nothing in it.
 What can i do, and if i did do it would i experience even the slightest bit of happiness?
