I'm a strong military person, currently deployed. My girlfriend has left me, because I continued to talk to an ex gf. She was my entire life and meant everything to me. She's shut me out and no way of contacting her. I love her with everything I am. I've never thought about suicide before, but today I have been seriously considering it. It's so selfish. I plan it completely, I wrote a note for people and when it came to doing it I couldn't do it, deep down I don't want to die, I don't want my gf or family to suffer because of my weakness, but I just want the pain to go away. I want to die. I don't want to wake up another morning into this nightmare. But my family and her don't deserve to have to handle the aftermath. I have. Nobody I can talk to about it that wouldn't make a dent in my career. I just wish I never woke up. If anyone has any advice please help. I know everyone will say always talk to someone, but I have nobody. And I can't with my job. Writing this was hard enough. I can't speak to anyone.
