I'm 17 High school student. 
We'll im going to try to put this into something people can understand What I mean SPOILER (if your not going to read the full story Don't Comment)
 We'll for the last 2 freaking year's I haven't been able to find anything that interest me I don't like talking to people and actually rather it be that way because people make me want to hurt them when they talk out of ignorance. I haven't told anyone this but "Below" 
 I woke about 1 month ago and was getting ready for school while i was waiting for my bus I starting Feeling like I wasn't in reality I started thinking about going in my house and hurting someone in my house  with no consequences "i don't usually Feel like that" Reality left me for about an hr.
 What do I mean when I say Reality Left Me? We'll it goes something like this when those thoughts hit me I felt really good" i actually could laugh and smile. Felt like I had no control for what I would Do.
 LASTLY 
I feel like no one can understand me, I feel lonely I don't talk to anyone in my family haven't for about 4 months,  I stay in my room listening to music and suffering this stupid unending feeling I have felt for 2 year's.
 IM OVER IT!!!!! im tired of people saying its life or, you need to go to group Counseling. I wan't it to end.
 What the hell would this be? that's truly how I feel right now and have for Years.
