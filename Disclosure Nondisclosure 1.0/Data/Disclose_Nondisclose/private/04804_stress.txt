So a month ago i got a prescription from my doctor for a cream to deal with eczema that had gotten a fungal infection. It took me several months to actually get around to seeing the doctor so I had that rash for awhile but before that I never had a problem with eczema and rashes except as a child. I am now in my second year of university, have my own appartment for the first time and am part time at a fast food joint in a very stressful atmosphere.
I am itchy all over, except for the two areas that were previously affected. I litterally mean all over. My legs my arms, my back. Recently the sides of my hands by my thumb down to my wrist broke out in to what looks to be hives. I've pretty much decided this is all due to stress. My main question is, should I go see my doctor again? If its due to stress I obviously need to work on my deep breathing skills etc. is there really anything my docotor can do for me besides what I can already figure out myself? Any tips for managing stress and itching would also be helpful!
