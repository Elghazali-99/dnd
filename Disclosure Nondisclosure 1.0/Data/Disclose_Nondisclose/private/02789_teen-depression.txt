Ever since I was very little I had depression, though it was only diagnosed when I was nine or ten. Lately it has been getting a lot worse, to the point where the school suggested I see a counselor. However, the minute I was in the car, alone with my mom she said "don't be silly, you don't need a counselor. What if I just talk with you more?" I told her that I thought I needed one, but she didn't listen very well.
 It's been about a year since that incident, and I still believe I need to see someone. I started seeing a counselor at school, who put me in a support group at school, for students with depression, at first it was fine, but then my sisters friend (whom I didn't know was in the support group) told her what had been going on, and she quickly rated me out to my parents. 
 They became angry at me for it, saying that I shouldn't be hiding things from them, and my mother once again suggested that we just 'talk more'. She said that if I hadn't been careful about what I said, they could have been in serious trouble. I felt hurt that they think I would have said something like that, but ignored it.
 I'm not sure if I should tell my parents how I'm feeling, or if that would just make it worse. I've since started seeing the counselor again, but in private. I really just don't know what to do.
