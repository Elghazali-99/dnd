I was put on Klonopin for a mis-diagnosis of epilepsy. I was on it for 8 years (2000-2008) and during that time, the side effect of the Klonopin was mis-diagnosed as depression and I was put on Zoloft, Effexor, and eventually Seroquel as well.  Once it was determined that I did not have epilepsy, I was taken off the Klonopin cold-turkey.  That was five moths ago.  I still have some withdrawal symptoms, but also developed involuntary tongue movement and as that can be connected to anti-psychotics, which Seroqeul is, I began to taper off of that drug about a month ago with no return of disturbed mood.  But now I read that anti-depressants can also cause involuntary tongue movements and I want off all of these drugs as soon as is safely possible.
 So my question is, does anyone have any information about tapering off more than one drug at a time.  I have always felt as though it would be best to do one at a time.  But this tongue thing may become irreversible and that is why I am considering taper off more than one.  Any links for info like this?  Anyone have experience with this?
 Thank you.
