Hi I am a 30 year old female and I work as a caregiver. I had a situation last night with one of my regular clients where he kept hugging me whilst I had finished getting him ready for bed (he is susceptible to falls so we help him with this as a precaution) and he then put his hands on the backs of my hips and then squeezed my bum. I was quite surprised at this as it happened before but we laughed it off and he apologised the next day.
 After squeezing my bum he then broke down and said he and his late wife (who I also cared for) used to have a fantastic sex life. I reassured him saying it must be still difficult since she is no longer with us. He then said he thinks he's trying to make up for it.
 Is this seen as abuse? I have informed my office and supervisor. My supervisor knew who it was before I named him and I feel terrible for reporting him. I felt terrible when I woke up today - feeling sick, not being able to feel up to eating, getting 5 hours sleep, ending up with bags under my eyes and just getting tearful.
