I am a diagnosed sz and about a month ago had a alchole induced pyschosis which lasted a day and a half. it was the usual ******** (the world is out 2 get me crap) then it went away. Firstly i have never had a psychosis from alchole but i'm now aware it happens. The remainder of the second day and for the next day i was fine but then bad thoughts started to come back into my mind. They were NO where near what they were like while i was in full psychosis and they were only once or twice a day (not 5 bad thoughts a second). Firstly i though it would go away again and that it was just me getting over the psychosis but 4 weeks on now they haven't gone away and they are starting to REALLY bother me. I have had psychosis twice before from weed which lasted about a week either time but after it stopped which was just like flicking a switch (in psychosis one second fine the next) i was COMPLETLY fine (NO bad thoughts remained).
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS - IS THIS NORMAL ? HAVE U HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING BEFORE ? WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE IT GO AWAY!!! ? DO I NEED A MED INCREASE AND WILL THAT HELP ?
PLEASE GET BACK 2 ME ASAP BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY ANNOYING 
P.S I WNAT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT I AM FINE FUNCTIONING IE GOING OUT IN PUBLIC ECT WHICH I DONT LIKE DOING WHEN IN FULL PSYCHOSIS BUT IM CERTAINLY NO 100% OK AND THE LONGER THIS GOES ON THE MORE FRUSTATING IT IT 
IE I AM STARTING 2 THINK IT WONT GO AWAY WHICH WOULD REALLY SUCK !!!
