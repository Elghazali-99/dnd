Okay so ever since I was small, my dad would beat my mom, me, my big sister, and little brother. He stopped beating my mom and little brother but, he would always yell or beat me and my big sister. He's even threatened to kill me or beat me. My mom still beats us too. My big sister is 18 and they recently beat her and took away her car. Whenever I hear either my mom or dad yelling, I would run and hide because I get very scared.
Also, I use to have a sexual active boyfriend. But he's my ex now. He would bribe me into having sex with him and he would put it as, "Have sex with me because you love me. Flash for me to show me how much you love me." He left me because I got too boring with him. (I only flashed for him and he left a week later) 
And he got a new girlfriend right after that. I have one class with him and I sit by him. He would touch my legs and try to reach my area. I would tell him to stop. I would slap his hand or move away from him. I would have told the teacher but it would catch a lot of people's attention and they would call me a **** or a hoe. He's done this a lot to me but he stopped. I cried in class once because he kept doing it to me and it got the whole classes' attention. I have a very nice boyfriend now but I'm wondering if any of this is abuse or not.
