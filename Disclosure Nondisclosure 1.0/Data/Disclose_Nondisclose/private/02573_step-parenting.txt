I am a father of four sons two I live with that are my step kids and I get my other boys on the weekend I'm having problems with the 13 year old step son who is disrespectful ungrateful and talks back. My wife his mother will not back me up at all I have tried grounding him talking things away from him and spanked him but nothing works. My wife is a stay home mom I work grave yards and everything I do to try to get close to him he pushes me away like he don't want a father his real dad is not in the picture he's not a good role model being in and out of jail . I see my step son fallowing in his steps hes been chought lieing stealing . And he plays the wadge game where he tells his mom something that I did or say and trys to put a wage between us and it's working because I don't have the support of my wife when it comes to him. I do admit I do cause and say some hurtful things to him when I have lost it for example yesterday I told him not to call me dad case he didn't respect me like one . Some one please help.
