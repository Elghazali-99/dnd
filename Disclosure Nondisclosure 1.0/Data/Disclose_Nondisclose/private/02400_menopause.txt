Hi, Could someone please tell me if this is something normal or if I need to see my doctor or if you have any idea what this is all about...almost 2 years ago my gyno did an ablation because I was having very heavy periods that lasted for weeks at a time. The ablation did not work and he wanted to do a total hysterectomy, however, I then contracted h1n1 and pnuemonia and was hospitlized for a couple of weeks and he then wanted to wait at least 6months until my lungs were strong enough for the surgery.  Well all of a sudden I stopped having my periods and I haven't had one in over a year so I never went back to the gyno for the hysterectomy. Then the other day I was just sitting and suddenly I felt a gush of fluid and when I checked it was almost like I was pregnant and my water broke...it was clear but tinged with brown (old) blood. this continued for the entire day...it was mostly clear fluid running out. I have felt pressure in my pelvic area for several months (I can't really say it's that painful...it's mostly uncomfortable pressure). I am 52 and I am diabetic as well.
I would really really appreciate any insight you could give me on this.
One more thing...I have heard that after a hysterectomy that when you start on hormones that women will put on a substanial amount of weight. Is that true?
Thanks again.
