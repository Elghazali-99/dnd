ok so i have been on lorazepam .5 mg for about 2 months well i started feeling migraines and like i needed to take two pills a day i did that maybe for two nights and said yea not for me, these drugs wont help either help long term i rather avoid long term use because of fear of a worse come down. Anyways i decided since i was on only 2 months and .5 to go cold turkey how big os a mistake is this. I have migraines and i havent used in 2 days and i feel a headahce or pressure but i feel like its not as bad as monday when i did take a pill durng thday but needed to take another one at night but i didnt take it, cuz i know u arent suppose ot take two in one day if not told by a doctor, how long can i expect to feel these migraines and like idk how to explain it if my usage was for about two months and change maybe 70 days if i think about it, and at.5 mG, is there anything natural i can take to help me come off it better maybe a tea or vitamins that can help not only help me quit cold turkey but also help with my bad anxiety and now small depression.
