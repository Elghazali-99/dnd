I have had trouble swallowing for several years, at first was manageable. Was told it was a symptom of GERD, so I was put on PPI's. Thinking back, I was able to manage and live in no dis-comfort up until a year ago. Went back to the doctors and was once again treated for GERD with more PPI's. Long story short, I finally got an EDG by a GI specialist and they found a "mass" in my throat. The picture looks like a bunch of grape sized lumps lining my throat, no discoloration or bleeding. It does not hurt when I swallow and I have not lost any weight, actually I have gained weight. I now have to wait a few days to see an ENT and im paralyzed with fear that it may be Cancer. I am only 29, male, non smoker (used to smoke in my teens, early 20's) and not a heavy drinker. I just feel constant dis-comfort, constant post nasal drip, which builds up and causes me to constantly gag. Drinking liquid makes things so much worse. I've been able to live in semi comfort by keeping food in my mouth like apples, carrots or bread to absorb or thin out my mucus/saliva and for some reason eating food although I do need to drink fluids to push the food down, some  how in small amounts makes my throat more comfortable. 
 There is always that feeling of something there...I can't swallow normally at all. I choke on my own saliva. No lumps in my neck or anything like that, just when it gets bad my neck aches and feels swollen. Any insight ....anybody?
