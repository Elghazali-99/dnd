I was a terribly heavy user of marijuana. I didnt necessarily smoke too much per day, its just the amount of years. I am now 24, and since I was a teenager, I havent quit for longer than a week. My boyfriend and I have been dating for 7 months, and he finally seen what it does to me (hes a non smoker) after having numerous fights, which is highly unlike us, i blurted out, FINE I will quit. But I never want to hear it fom your mouth again. 
So this is day two, my appetite is very low. And the amount of anger I have raging inside of me is almost unbearable. I have a lot of anger towards the one I love, and I dont want to push him away. By him telling me I can do it, and stay strong, only makes me even more angry. I guess, in a seperate situation, he would be that person that drags me into rehab. Of course Im going to be angry at him. But, hes my soulmate. I have to learn how to deal with this depression and anger, before I push away the only person I care about. Please help me.
