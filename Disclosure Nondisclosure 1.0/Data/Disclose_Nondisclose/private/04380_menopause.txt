Until recently, my periods have always lasted about 6 days. For the past four months, my periods have lasted only 3-4 days. I've had numerous additional strange symptoms that sound like perimenopause: insomnia, constipation/bloating, hair loss on head, new hair growth on face, intense premenstrual cramping and lower back pain, low libido, dryer skin, and just last night I had my first night sweat. I also now have chronic dark circles under my eyes and have noticed more brown spots on my face.  
 I've had a ton of different hormones tested, all of which have been within normal range, and "good" according to my doctor. My thyroid is normal. My day-2 FSH is 5.8. Normal day-2 estradiol, LH, and prolactin. Normal day-20 estradiol, progesterone, 17-OH progesterone LCMS, testosterone, and DHEA-Sulfate. 
 I don't know what to make of all this. Could I be entering perimenopause despite all my normal hormone results? Could this just be an age-related hormonal change that is not perimenopause? I feel like at 30, I'm too young to be experiencing all of these strange hormonal issues. Or maybe there is some underlying disease causing all of this? I've obviously already been to doctors, but they just brush me off when my test results come back normal. 
 I'm really distressed about what could be causing all this. Plus, the insomnia is making life miserable. Please help! : (
