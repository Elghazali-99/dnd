I had been on Venlafaxine for a number of years. First, at 75 mg and then eventually down to 32.5 mg. I consulted my doctor and at my request, decided I would discontinue the medication. She suggested I cut my dosage in half every two days. This did not work as I felt very ill and decided to cut dosage every two-three weeks. Three months later, I am off the medication completely. However, ever since I started decreasing the dosage, my mood and emotions have been unsteady, to stay the least. And, the more I decreased, the more emotional, sad and, depressed I became. At this point, being completely off the medication for about a week, I cry, about three times a day. Additionally, I have low energy and a very little appetite. The most frustrating thing however, is my mood. I dont feel happy or look forward to anything, and get annoyed and upset very easily. I don't think that I am clinically depressed, either. I really do not want to go back on this medication but I would like to know if this is normal and if so, do the symptoms tend to last for a certain amount of time?  Thank you
