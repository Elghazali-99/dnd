I have bipolar II, Major depression and generalized anxiety. I have been working with my psychiatrist for 10+ years to find a combination of medications to relieve my symptoms. 
I have been taking Wellbutrin XR, Lexapro and Klonopin (as needed.) Last year we added Abilify and the results were incredible. I came out of a very dark place, laughed, chatted, felt positive emotions and, for the first time in 15 years, felt like a "normal" person. But after a month or so I developed severe akathisia. It was so unbearable that I stopped taking Abilify. 
This year I moved to another state and began seeing a new psychiatrist. I decided to give Abilify another try. I had the same amazing results but the akathisia returned. My psychiatrist said we could try adding Propranalol or increase the Abilify doseage. (Increase not decrease.) I opted for Propranalol and began taking 20 mg daily. It didn't help and I stopped Abilify/Propranalol. (I couldn't bear to try a higher dose of Abilify.)
It's so sad not to be able to take it because it's a wonder-drug for me. I want to find a way to deal with this Akathisia issue. I've been reading and researching and came across this article from the British Journal of Psychiatry: http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/196/2/89.full
In part it suggests Propranalol treatment of 40-80 mg a day twice daily. I was only taking 20mg daily. Was this perhaps too low and what's a tactful way to discuss this with my psychiatrist? 
In part it also suggests switching to a low potency FGA or "to a more commonly used SGA with low potential to induce akathisia (e.g. quetiapine)" Nowhere does it suggest increasing an Abilify doseage. Does that have some merit?
I would appreciate any advice or information as I'm desperate to start feeling normal again.
