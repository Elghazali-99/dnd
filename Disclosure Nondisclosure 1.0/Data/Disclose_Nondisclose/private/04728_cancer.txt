I was 26 when I discovered I had ovarian cancer. I had a foot long tumor on my ovary which turned out to be a juvenile granulosa cell tumor. My tumor burst on the operating table and they performed a complete hysterectomy removing both ovaries as well. The tumor board recommended chemotherapy so 2 months after my first surgery I started chemo. The chemotherapy included sisplaytin, if I'm spelling that correctly, and it was quite harsh . I lost my hair and was nauseated but 2 treatments in they discovered the port they implanted in me caused an infection that traveled to my heart and resulted in open heart surgery and 6 months later my cancer came back. At this point my wonderful doctor suggested femara or letrozole that shrunk my tumors in half and I was able to have another surgery. The last surgery seemed to get all of the cancer and I continue to this day to take femara and I'm currently 4 years in remission. The femara saved my life however the side effects are horrible. I have a fever most nights and of course hot flashes, since I'm in menopause, and I'm nauseated most of my waking moments. Plus my bones ache and I just feel horrible overall. It feels like I'm swimming against the current every day of my life,  just walking 50 feet exhausts me. I was wondering if there was any new treatment for my type of cancer or anything I can do to combat the side effects. I am glad to be alive but I'm really living a half life currently. I'm open to any suggestions. Thank you
