Hello I'm a 21 year old female. Been through a lot in my life. Most things happening just recently. In October was thrown out of my home due to inability of me or parents able to pay. I'm in college which Is also stressful but I'm march I went through the worst stress ever!! My home was in jeopardy again my mother was threatening suicide, my car was breaking down, my dad and stepdad both just stopped talking to me bc they always think I need help or something with money. And I was trying to maintain a relationship with a great guy I just met. My life was falling apart and for a straight two weeks that's how things were. Finally my mom got a little better and accepted that we have to stay where we are until I finish school. Ok so after a bit if the stress resolved I woke up march 27th dizzy...spaced out and just weird feeling. During the stress I wasn't eating at all. So it got to where I almost passed out so I went to the ER. They said it was labyrinths and sent me on my way with meds which did not work. Then after a month or so of the horrible dizzy and weak feelings my lower back started to hurt and I have a pressure feeling in my rectum. I've used hemroid creams but it's not working so I was starting to think is was from stress. Because now even though the stress is over for the most part i am never convinced that everything won't fall apart any minute...but daily I feel horrible!!!!! Could it be from the stress I went through?
