Let me start off that im 6 months pregnant and my husband is locked up in jail right now.
Me and my husband just got married while he was in jail and he is still there. We have been trying to have a baby for over a year already but I didnt get pregnant because we were on heroin. I went to rehab and he was put in jail about 7-8 months ago and we got clean and got out. We went back to heroin and we both got locked up about 3 months ago and I foubd out I was pregnant. We had an idea I was pregnant but before we got locked up we didnt believe it because we have gone thru the disappointment so many time. So I got out of jail and still addicted to heroin but my husband is still locked up.
I dont know what to do because I want to quit heroin but then again it keeps me from being sad about not having my husband here with me thru the pregnancy. I just feel sad and stay in my room all day long. Can someone please tell me what I can do because I just feel like a bad mom but I just dont want to go thru sadness while my husband is locked up. Please let me know what I should do.
