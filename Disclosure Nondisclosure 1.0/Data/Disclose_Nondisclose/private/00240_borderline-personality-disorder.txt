My BPD has become so much better since the last 2 years. 3 years ago- I was living in hell. Everyone around me hated me. I still have anger issues and abandonment issues, but it's comparatively better. 
My problem is whenever I'm under stress I get very irritable and that triggers my anger. But I'm not sure if I have BPD anymore.
My psychiatrist believes I do but I feel calmer now. I know that maybe in a week, it might start. Sometimes I deal with people when I'm angry pretty maturely and sometimes I just fly off the handle. I'm almost always never talking to on close friend and I won't give in until they show that they care and apologize. I'm lonely and I want to be in a relationship but I'm too scared that they will be attached and clingy. Hence, I can't date anyone for more than a week. I don't know how l feel. I just feel empty and bored and I have sex a lot. Like this big hole which can't be filled. 
I have a bright career ahead, but sometimes I feel I chose it so I don't have to make a choice. I sort of brainwashed myself into it. I'd like to know if this is normal or BPD ish behaviour. I really need some reassurance.
