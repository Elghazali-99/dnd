My mother has been diagnosed with chronic depression, but I'm certain there is something else plaguing her.The rest of my family agrees but trying to convince her to take depression medications is pointless let alone seek treatment for other things. She has always been unstable. When I was 4 she told me I would grow up and hate her, and now she is convinced she was right. She throws temper tantrums that including kicking and throwing things (luckily not at people) and has random angry outbursts that always revolve around what those around her have done to hurt her. She is never happy with any of the choices I make for myself despite the fact that I'm very responsible: graduating college, small business owner, married to a great guy. She tells me I have depression despite the fact that I love my life and when I'm not with her I'm very happy. I don't know what to do. No matter what she doesn't like my decisions, and no matter how hard I try I can't convince her that I love her. She goes back and forth between villifying me and acting like I'm the best thing ever when talking to other people, but in private she's never happy with me. I can't handle the emotional stress she puts on me, but I don't want to cut off all ties. I believe very strongly in family and I want to be there for her even when she thinks I don't. What do I do? How can I deal with this and continue my happy life in peace? It's like driving along a beautiful road and then being jerked to a stop so Mom can yell at you every hour or so.
