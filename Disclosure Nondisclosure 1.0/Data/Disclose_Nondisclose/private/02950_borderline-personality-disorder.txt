Hello. I am almost 20. also female.
if you have any ideas please let me know... sorry this may be a lil long...
  i have been worried about my way of thinking/lifestyle alot lately.
for years i have always been so down on myself and have always felt "alone"
its never gotten better, only worse.
I have GAD and panic disorder. Im ALWAYS depressed.. but occasionally i get these manic bouts of happiness for no reason.  Ive noticed a horrible pattern of distructive behavior. It started years ago.. but like ive become so addicted to "attention" and "self-pity" that ive become a pathelogical liar, and i act out in ways such as drinking, taking pills, smoking, cheating/affairs, threating suicide, attempting suicide,  just to get people to feel sorry for me and try to "help" me. and then once they try to "help" me, i get mad and dont want to listen to them.... 
its like i dont even know who i am anymore, and i never thought in a million years id be the way i am today... but i dont know what my problem is.
ive cried myself to sleep sooo many times trying to figure out why i do the things i do.. ive put myself in an emotionally abusive relationship (2years now) and im scared to be without him. 
i have a real hard time concentrating. it almost feels like im living in a "dream". i dont feel like this is real. i cant keep a job because i get so stressed out and full of anxiety.. 
i go through episodes of "sleep paralysis" for weeks at a time.. and have anxiety/panic attacks daily. 
i just dont know what to do anymore...
 please let me know if have any ideas of whats wrong with me.. maybe something i can get help with??
