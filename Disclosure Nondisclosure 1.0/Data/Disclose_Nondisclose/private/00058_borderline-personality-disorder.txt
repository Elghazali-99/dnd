I am a 31 yr old female who is currently diagnosed as bipolar. I live a "normal" life. I have 2 children from previous relationships, and i recently got remarried to a wonderful man who has 2 children of his own. From the age of 3 I have endured plenty of horrible things in my life such as sexual molestation, rape, domestic abuse, gang violence, and an emergency hysterectomy at the age of 25. I am currently taking medication for bipolar and anxiety, and I have an amazing counselor that I meet with regularly. My parents, my brother, and my now husband are the greatest. They have been there for me through all of my ********. I am starting to get worried about myself. Whenever I find myself alone with my thoughts, all I can think about is how my husband is cheating on me every chance he can get, my kids would be happier if they lived with my parents, and how it would be so easy to swallow a bottle of pills and end all this mental anguish. I NEVER act out on these thoughts, but it is an every day occurance. I tend to think my husband is lying to me constantly, and I find myself trying to pick fights with him. I think everything that goes wrong in someone else's life is some how my fault, and i constantly have feelings of guilt for no reason. But the minute my kids come home, or my husband comes home, or i go to my parents, i feel like i am on top of the world. I do not want to lose my husband. I try very hard to control my snide comments and my attitude because I do understand that my thinking and behavior is not rational most of the time. I just dont know what to do anymore. I feel like i am losing my mind. I dont want to get to the point where i have hurt everyone i love and pushed them away...because i can see myself doing it already. Any thoughts, suggestions, or info would be much appreciated
