I've just recently realized with the help of a few friends that my mother has been emotionally abusive all my life. She's a wonderful person, and a great mom, except her temper is so extreme and at times violent, that everyone around her is afraid of her and can't really open up to her. You never know what's going to set her off. It's the tiniest things most of the time. She and my Dad are getting divorced after 25 years of marriage because she's so abusive to him he can't take it anymore, but she still thinks that everything that's ever gone wrong in their marriage is his fault. She's trying to take him for all he has, and I can't let her do that to him because it's completely crushing his spirit. 
What I want to know is, does anyone have advice for a way to get her into therapy? I've confronted her before about all this, and I thought she had listened to me, but it turns out she told someone else about it and made it sound like I was just a dumb kid blowing things out of proportion and she had just been humoring me. (I am 23 years old, not a child or teenager, so this was especially inappropriate.) I'd appreciate any advice! Thanks.
