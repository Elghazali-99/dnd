I am a 60 y.o. woman who became disabled after a transit accident 6 yrs ago. In 6 months time, we lost our home, lived in a motel (long-term disability from emplyer), found an apartment & thought we were seeing the end of the nightmare.Two weeks after we moved in our ap t, i found my significant other dead in bed, accidental asphyxiation under influence of sleeping med. I was already being treated for Depression & mild Anxiety. These evolved into PTSD/borderline Agoraphobia/Chronic Depression/Panic Disorder. In addition, over the past 2 yrs., I've been dx'd w/Fibro; Osteoarthritis & Diverticulitis.I have been on Diazepam (Valium) 5 mg. & Alprazolam (Xanax) 2 mg. for 5 yrs. I have become a virtual shut-in; combined iwth my physical conditions & other meds (Gabapentin/Cymbalta/Metaxalone), I am fatigued, sleep a lot, lethargic & suffer bouts of "Fibro fog" & fed up! I want my life bakc to the best degree that i can have it. I have found some programs for underinsured that will provide CBT & Alternative Care but not until I am off the benzos. My psych 7 I have discussed but I think he is on the verge of dropping me due to Medicare underpaying and my frequent telephone appointments dueto the lethargy/Agoraphobia issues. He has not returned my calls in 2 weeks & I made it clear to his assistant that I want to be weaned off benzos.I knowmy psychconcurs but now I hear nothing from him. What do I do>
