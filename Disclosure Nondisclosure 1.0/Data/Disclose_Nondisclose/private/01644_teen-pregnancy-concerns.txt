So here's the story. 
I am on birth control and I went to visit my boyfriend and we had unprotected sex(well..didn't use a condom at any time) every day for like a week and a half. And I was fine. And then the last week (August 4th) my period started and so we didn't have sex for 2 days. But thenn we wanted to again so we did it a couple times until I left on August 8th. After my period is over, I'm supposed to start my birth control again for the next 3 weeks. So I started taking it after my period ended. Anddd so it's been 3 weeks and I stopped taking my birth control so my period could come and I thought it was spotting because it was so light, like barely anything there and definitely not as much as usual..so was it my period or spotting? But idk if I could even be pregnant (I mean obvious there is a chance, and I know that) but you know what I mean? Does any one have some sort of idea? (He didn't ejeculate in me at all (and yes I know pre*** could be there as well) but ya..any advice?) 
Thank you in advance to whoever answers :)
