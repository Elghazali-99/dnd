I feel like I'm depressed in a sad mood and I try so hard to be in a good mood and ignore everything but it ended up I ignored everyone and everything that once made me happy and I barley know them now my mom and dad do drugs and they keep it up stairs I have seen it a few times and I won't turn in my parents is cause they only get charged with possecion and ik my dad will know it was me and he will hit me my dad has no respect for anyone he hits my mom and my brother he hit me once and he hasn't again but he likes to yell and push and say really mean things over small things ex : Christmas morning I was making pancakes and he wanted bacon and no one else did but I made it and I didn't know how to cook it so it turned out bad he he yells at me to come look at it and says Wat ******* woman doesn't know how to cook ... And. A whole lot more but you get the point he does nothing in the house he works weekends wen we ask him not too and mom works all week I haven't had a sleep over in over a year because I'm two loud with my friends dad is trying to sleep when it's during the day I can't have friends eather were to loud and so I started just sitting in my room alone and now I'm getting kinda chubby I used to weigh 123 and that's where I was doing good and then I am now 147 last time I checked and it's not just my tummy getting bigger everything has ... My mom calls me big and fat and says I need to loose weight ... At school I am kinda quiet I do good in school I guess if I don't I get grounded and broken down .. My family has enough to survive but if my parents wernt buying drugs every month and buying tons of ciggerates every day I would be able to have a phone but no I'm turning 15 and have never had a phone or anything like that I saved all my money up for years and last year I bought myself an iPod ... My mom and dad say I need a job but I'm 14 and no one around here is hiring ... And my dad will steal my money I coughts him once .. I live in a nice sized home but it is falling apart :/ idk what to do anymore I imagine me killing my mom and dad and sometimes my brother or just killing myself
