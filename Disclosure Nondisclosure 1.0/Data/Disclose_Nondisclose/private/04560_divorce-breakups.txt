Please I need some sound advice.  I have been married for 26 years to my husband have three daughters and a grand baby we are both nearly 50.  At this time in our relationship I feel so lost and do not know what action to take.  He has always loved to flirt and have attention all through our marriage their have been issues that I just put behind me.  But just lately I noticed a change in him.  We moved to the US from UK six years ago but husband overstepped the mark their with his office assistant had a fixation for her and I found out he had taken her out behind my back.  He said nothing happened and was sorry things seemed okay after moving here and were back to normal.  Now he is back to his old ways he started chatting to a women on the internet which he has done before and I found out and said I blow everything out of proportion but I found the conversation was more than just friendly.  Then he told me through our marriage he has had crushes on other women and just recently while being treated with therapy for a road traffic injury he told me he had a mega crush on one of the therapists I found out he had been researching her on the internet trying to find on her facebook.  He said I should be grateful that he kept it in control and nothing happened but I feel everytime he does this its like a knife in my heart.  I work part-time he has to do nothing in the house I take care of it he just comes home puts his feet up always a meal cooked for him.  He never shows me any affection or tells me that he loves unless I do him.  We have two daughters living at home 21 and 17 and they have noticed how I do everything for him and shows you affection to me.  I am so totally lost right now I would love to go back to UK but I love my family too much to leave them behind.  Please help me find a solution.
