Hey everyone new to this site, but it's been very informative so far! Sorry for the long story, but I'm in an extremely bad state and need your opinions. 
 I'm 23 year old male that was diagnosed with ADHD 6 years ago and have/continue to have success with 20 mg adderall IR 2 times a day. I've had depression for as long as I can remember and have been treated with practically all SSRI/SNRI medications in the past with unbearable side effects so had to stop taking them. 
 I recently fell into the worse depression and anxiety of my life a few months ago. I Voluntarily entered a crisis stabilization center for 30 days. While there, I was diagnosed with GAD, SAD, Major Depressive Disorder, and PTSD. Upon diagnosis I was prescribed Zoloft 75 mg, Trazodone 50 mg, and Vistiral 25 mg PRN. I started these 3 new medications June 2nd and go for my first follow up appointment since leaving the treatment center on Monday. The Vistiral is doing absolutely nothing for my anxiety... no prescriptions for Benzos in the treatment center I was in. 
 I've been prescribed daily Klonopin in the past from my GP and would like to go back on that, but don't want to seem like "Drug Seeker". Is there a way I should go about asking for it? I've never had any abuse with medications in the past, but sadly there is a stigma out there for Benzos. My symptoms are by far worse then when I started these 3 new medications. I am lethargic, extremely anxious to the point that I can barely leave my house or go to job interviews, constantly fatigued, and overall have NO motivation. I have always been a very driven person so this is very alarming to me. 
 Any advice for how I should handle the appointment? My anxiety/depression, fatigue, and lack of motivation are hindering my ability to complete even the simplest of tasks. Thanks in advance for any advice you can give!
