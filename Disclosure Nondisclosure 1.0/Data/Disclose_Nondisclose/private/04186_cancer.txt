To whom it may concern,
 For my research project my question is "How do cancerous germ cell tumours develop and how can they be detected in their early stages?" In relation to the primary research of my task, I would like to request an interview with an oncologist who may be able to assist me with my interview. If you are able to respond to my queries I will list the questions below. If not, I apologize for any inconveniences caused.
 Regards
 The questions are: 
1) At what stage of germ cell cancer do people realise that a consultation is required based on their accounts of the symptoms?  
2) What are some common changes or severities of symptoms of germ cell cancer as the tumour grows and develops through different stages?
3) What methods of diagnosis are best for the detection of any early malignant growth of a germ cell neoplasm?
4) What are the differences of curing germ cell cancer in advanced stages (if possible), as opposed to when curing it in early stages?
5) Do you have any advice that I could convey to my audience about the warning signs of germ cell cancer?
6) Is there a possibility for you to recommend a patient or past patient of germ cell cancer whom I can contact for further assistance for my research?
 If you wish, I may keep your identity anonymous, but please inform me to do so. Else, because I must have references your name and qualification may be mentioned in the analysis of my interview.
 Thank You
