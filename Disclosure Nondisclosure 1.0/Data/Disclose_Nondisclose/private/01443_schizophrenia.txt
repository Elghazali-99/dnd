Hello. I've been searching for a way to share my condition to receive support from people.
 I'm 14 years old and since I was 6-7 I've liked being alone and avoided befriending a lot of people. When I sit among company I'd stop hearing their voices, as if they turn mute and then begin hearing different voices and see different people then I would start talking to them in my mind. 
 There are two people which I see every day, but people don't see them. Sometimes when i'm talking to my friend they would talk aswell and confuse me. I'm afraid to bring this up or even mention this to any of the people I know and see everyday. They are so real to me that the thought of them not being 'here' is just wrong and crazy. 
 I am very normal around my family so I really don't think they would take me seriously. I can sit for hours and hours in my room, just imagining stories and talking to them. I am an insomaniac, so I would also spend the whole night with them, and end up sleeping at sunrise.
 Is this normal, and will it affect mylife if I don't seek help?
