My granddaughter is just 18. She moved out of her mother's home and is living with a guy who is about 25. She has a history of being abused by her step father who is currently in prison for that abuse. Her father died several years ago. Recently, there was a violent episode between her and her boyfriend that ended with the police being called and him being charged. During the incident, she cried and said she had never seen him like that ... didn't know what happened to him ... etc. Shortly after, she claimed he didn't really hit her. It was all an accident and SHE is the one who had a fit and broke the glass, etc. The neighbors said that wasn't true. It had happened before.  This is not the first physical abuse she has had in a relationship. In fact, it's about her third!!!
 Anyway, we have told her that we cannot condone the relationship and don't want any part of him. We have also told her that we love her unconditionally and she comes to our house for Family Sundays on a regular basis. Now, she says, we had better get over it and accept him, because she is going to marry him very soon and wants us at the wedding. 
 I have asked for time to talk with her and she has agreed. I have promised no lectures, no judgments ... just the opportunity to give her my input and ask some questions. They have both had anger management classes, but this is a pattern in their relationship of several years. 
 What do I say. Is she just munipulating us (she has a history of that too) I'm a little panicked right now. Don't want to lose her, but don't want to encourage this relationship. 
HELP!
