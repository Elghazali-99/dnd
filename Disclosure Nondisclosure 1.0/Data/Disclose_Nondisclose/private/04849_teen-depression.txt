i had a messed up relationship 3 years ago which caused me start doing drugs for a year (i have stopped for 2 years now) and the girl i was dating left me for no reason and i found out later on that she cheated on me with very close friends of mine..so i decided to get through the depression phase and stopped doing drugs and got into two other relationships after that..right now im with a sweet girl but we are having serious issues due to my trusting issues..i cant trust her with anything, when she tells me shes going out with her mom, i start having all these thoughts, what if shes not? what if shes cheating on you..its like im paranoid and scared of being alone..
 i also suffer from anxiety with derealization which makes everything worse..sometimes i feel like im crazy and i will end up in a mental hospital because of these thoughts i have..sometimes i find myself arguing with girlfriend just to get reassurance that shes not cheating on me and most of the time she ends up crying because of it..the thing is i really want to fix this..
 what are some ways to stop these thoughts? how can i prove myself that im not mental and crazy? how can i gain a sense of security about myself? im 19 btw
