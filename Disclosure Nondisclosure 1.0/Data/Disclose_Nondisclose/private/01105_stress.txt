Hi I am 19 years old and I am somewhat new to this site. It has helped me out in more ways than one. I just have a question that I hope could be answered. I went to the doctors a few weeks ago because I have been expierencing brain fog or "mental confusion" so call it. I sometimes forget where I am and it feels like I am in constant day ja vou. The mornings are not that bad I somewhat feel like myself which Really bugs me. The doctor put me on a aneixty medicine thinking it was anexity. It did work for the first week or so and now it seems like it does nothing. But the wierd part about it is if I take a tylenol or take a power nap I feel a little better. I just was wondering if stress could do this because I really am under alot of pressure between school work etc. I dont drink or smoke illegal drugs so I know it has nothing to do with that. It just feels when I start putting my body physically to work is when it is real bad and I feel like passing out. I do know that sometimes I only average about 6 hours of sleep everynight. I just need help because I am starting to get worried that this is something serious and that I will not return to my normal self again. As well no one believes me on how I feel that all say I sound a look fine including my parents but I know how I feel and I try not to let this get to me as much as possible. Please Help I really need to find a solution fast because I really and getting sick of going to the doctor and pumping my body full of pills that dont seem to help. Thank you Thomas
