Hello, my name is Cynthia. I am 17. I am clinically depressed, and suffer from up to 4 panic attacks daily. I hate myself, and everything around me. 
I have a list of medicines I am on: Xanax, Citalopram, Lamactil, Ambien, the list goes on. The list for my diagnoses is just as bad: PTSD, Agoraphobia, Anxiety Disorder, Clinical Depression, insomnia,etc.
You see, when I was young I was molested by my older cousin. He terrified me, to the point that I have been afraid of men. My first boyfriend, ever, wanted sex. I politely declined, but then he pushed me down and made it clear I didnt have a choice. I was horrified. I was raped. After the raping, he beat me for months. I finally ended it and moved onward. Then my parents went through a nasty divorce, my dad scared me several times. 
All in all, over the years I have been through a lot. I am horrified of guys, sex, even my own body. I have been cutting for years, burning myself, even tried to OD twice.
I seriously just want to end it all.
