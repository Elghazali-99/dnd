Hello everyone,
 I'm 47 years old and have been having perimenauposal symptoms for over 2 years, mainly  sporadic night sweats.
My periods have been somewhat irregular for the last year, ranging from 28 to 38 days. 
My question is relating to menstrual spotting.
 My last periods started October 9th, and were a bit longer than usual. About 4 days after finishing I had 3 days of very light spotting, which is kind of unusual for me. I haven't had a period until I started spotting on Dec. 4th, two months after my last period. This spotting is also very light, as I do not need to use any pantyliner; it's mainly small streaks on the toilet paper pinkish to light red in color. I do not have any other physical symptoms, besides some slight pulling sensation in my right ovary on a couple of occasions that lasted only brief moments. I now have been spotting for 2 weeks, and I was wondering if I should be worried? I'm under a tremendous amount of stress right now, can it have an effect on this irregularity?
 Thank you in advance to anyone who might enlighten me.
