I have a big issue. I love my cat absolutely to death. I couldn't imagine ever actually hurting him, but, especially lately, I've been lashing out at him really bad. He could do a minor thing to irritate me and I'm screaming bloody murder at him and he freaks out and runs away. Or if I'm holding him and he gets really mad, when all he wants to do is get away from being forced to be held, which I should understand because I would hate being restrained like that too, I still get really mad and force him to be held longer. If he even tries to bite me I sometimes slap him or hit his nose, not too hard, but hard enough to know he's done something wrong, and i know how wrong i am in all this, i feel so guilty, i'm bawling my eyes out as i type this, but i don't know what to do. I don't understand why my anger is so out of control. I have an anxiety disorder that i've had for multiple years that could be partially to blame but i can't fully blame it on that. If anyone has any advice please please please help me. I'm on the verge of giving him to someone because i don't want him to end up becoming angry or resentful or scared all the time. Typically it's good, but every once in a while i let my anger get the best of me. please help me.
