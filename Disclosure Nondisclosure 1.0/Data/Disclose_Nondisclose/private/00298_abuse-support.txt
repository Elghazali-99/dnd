Last Sunday, I picked my 3 1/2 year old up from a visitation weekend at her father's house.  Her father has a 15 year old brother, who has been baker acted for self mutilation and drugs.  My ex-mother-in-law said my daughter hadn't had a bowel movement all weekend (which is unusual for her).  When I got her home, I gave her some children's lax and put her in the tub to relax.  She had a bowel movement, and screamed.  I was drying her off, got to her tush and she screamed at me again, DON'T TOUCH ME, IT HURTS!  I told her I had to check her butt for poop, and she told me to do it gentle, it hurts.  I did, and she still screamed how it hurt.  I asked her what was wrong and if someone touched her.  She said yes, and when I asked who she named her father's brother.  I reported it, but the detective on the case didn't take me seriously, even though my daughter told him what happened.  He told me that her statements are not qualifying because of her age.  I am still expected to bring her to that house, where her father hasn't called to check on her and no one believes it happened.  To me, for a 3 year old to state that, and restate it 3 days later, that says something.  Please, any suggestions are very much appreciated!!  Thanks.
