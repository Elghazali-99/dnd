So, me and my gf has been together for almost a year now. Within this year we have gotten into several fights. It all started with me, being drunk one night and choking her until her face turned purple. I have since, tried my best to make up for that, but now when she's drunk, she goes crazy on me and I have no choice, but to defend myself. I don't want to go over all the fights but just one night ago, she went crazy. I can't lie. I was having my issues that night to, but I didn't hit her. Next thing you know she's hitting me in my face and pulling my hair, while I'm screaming at her to stop. I tried pushing her against the wall. I mean slamming her. I finally get her off of me. Scream at her that I don't want to fight! But at that point it's like, she doesn't give a ****. She hit me and starts pulling my hair again. Then biting! She bit into my finger until it bleed. And she kept biting harder and harder. I had to punch her in her face, more than once to get her off.... I know this relationship isn't healthy. I don't even think we should be together. But what can do??? What can I do. I love her very much. And until things start to change I'm going to be nervous of this relationship.
