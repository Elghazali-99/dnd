I am very concerned about my sister.  She has this problem which has a few differents angles. One is she brings up things that have happened in the past that have hurt her millions of times.  If she has visitors she may tell them at breakfast lunch and tea.  There is ALWAYS a huge drama in her life.  She has had some awful things happen but some of these stories are totally her imagination and grow in length severity with time.  She has fallen out with nearly all her  close friends and family at any stage of her life...........and sometimes never speaks to them again.  Her own two boys and hubby would of heard them I don't know how many times...........when she gets going no one else can say a thing she just talks talks talks...........Its affected her direct family too. 
 Sometimes she purposely makes people do things so she can complain about it later (eg says we don't need tea, just a cuppa when visiting) and then later complains they gave her no tea. 
 She is a beautiful person if you take this awful problem away..........Please help.  She is a very lonely person because the whole world is against her.  (she thinks)
