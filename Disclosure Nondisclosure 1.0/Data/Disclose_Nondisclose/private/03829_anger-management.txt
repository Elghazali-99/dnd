My boyfriend & i have been together for 1.5 years, i am constantly picking fights with him over the last year. this relationship is getting so tiring that i'm thinking if we're better off going our separate ways.
 He's always been a caring partner and would never fail to hear me out/talk whenever i have my low moments(i was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago). Despite this, i've always been unsatisfied with other aspects of our relationship as he always fail to keep to his words and would make empty promises. i've tried talking about this to him but it keeps repeating till im getting so sick of this (he acknowledges it is a bad habit of his). For eg., he'd say he'll take me out to this and that but would 99% of the time fail to take action. this really disappoints me and with the many resentments i keep inside, lashing out at him for minor reasons has become a habit. i get very disappointed bcs i'd like us to do more things as a couple(we rarely go out and do fun stuff). There were two occasions where i got so angry at him that i hit him in the chest and arms(not proud of that). when i get angry it can escalate quickly and i will fail to think rationally. I dont know why i just cant communicate like an adult (in my early 20s).
 This only happens with him though. I think it's because i put so much expectations on him as he's my bf. I'm really trying to figure out what is the problem here as it keeps repeating. I'm not sure if breaking up over the fact that he doesnt keep to his words is a good reason to let this go, as I really do appreciate the fact that he cares for me and i trust him completely. I am not sure if having a mental illness clouds my judgment of this situation. Please help
