I'am a 31/m and have been fighting what i think is major depression pretty much all my life.Most of the worst symptoms ive had are constant (brain fog/anxiety/depression/racing thoughts)Now i have tried about 4-5 different ssri's and havent felt better from any of them.It's always the same  when im on them as in i feel this adrenaline pumping like i want to jump out of my skin allll the time! No energy either.Other strange things happen like my chest will tighten up when i yawn,and have this feeling run through my body which i guess is supposed to be a good feeling but i think its far from that.
 Do people who take ssri's for depression get that same feeling when it works?Probably doesnt make sense but its in no way enjoyable for me.I end up stopping them after a few months as it gets to be too much.Never end up feeling any better,still the constant brain fog and anxiety.
 Anyways im seeing a doctor on friday in hopes i can explain myself better to get on a new medication.I have talked to a psych doctor once about what i was feeling and he mentioned possible bipolar.I know there are things like hypomania and what not but i Dont stay up for days on ends or anything like that.Just nothing out of the ordinary.My moods are either depression with anxiety/panic attacks or really bad depression with the anxiety panic attacks and just not wanting to live.Never does my anxiety go away or the constant brain fog.
 Im scared to try another ssri as i know for sure those feelings are gonna come back.Does anyone have an explanation of the 'jumping out of skin' feeling when on a ssri?thanks
