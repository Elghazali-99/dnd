What is the deal these days ? I don't know but when I stood in front of an ordain man of the cloth that meant something to me . We took vows in front of god to god to forever be faithful and loving in sickness an in health good times an bad times till death do we part. ANd I stand by those vows but I'm not so sure my wife is or will? That up to her I guess. Todays world is just so messed up have we lost the concept of true love an faithfullness is marriage just a piece of paper nowdays ? When u got married in days of old U were married and that's all there was to it . If u weren't in it for the long haul why would u do it. It just makes thing worse especialy when you start adding kids cuz really there the one that r going to pay the price. Yet its a catch 22 if she wouldn't Have married me I wouldn't have two great kids but now its got down hill and there going to pay . So I can say I wish she wouldn't have married me. But then I wouldn't have them . Sorry for rambling just looking for anyones input on commitment please and how they feel about it this whole world can't be that messed up I hope?
