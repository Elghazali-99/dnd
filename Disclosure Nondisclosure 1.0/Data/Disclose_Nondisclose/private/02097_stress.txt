Loosing eyebrows - what is this!?!?!
I started to lose my eyebrows in a diffuse type of loss (from the nose and out) a few years ago, but it was not noticeable to others. They gradually get thinner over month/ years, especially the right one. One year ago the loss was to such an extent it was noticeable and I had to start using make up to cover up. 
 Since I got pregnant in january this year the loss started to increase in tempo - my right brow is almost gone by now (half way due to conceiving), 60% of the hair in the brows are gone. I also just recently saw a little "gap" in my eyelashes too. I have no hair loss on the head. 
 Checked thyroid + all other possible diseases that affects hair growth - etc and its all good. My B12 was low, but they started to give me B12-injections a month ago, lets see if this changes anything. Also I have pregnancy related diabetes. 
 My doctors cant find anything else wrong with me, several dermatologists ment this is NOT Alopecia because the hairless is diffuse (not "patches" or "spots" and have been gradually .going over years). I wonder of it still can be Alopecia? Or is this Cronic Telogen Effluvium? 
 Can it be due to stress (high adrenaline/ cortisol levels) over many years? I have been really stressed over many years and I have a lot of heartbeat / panic disorder like symptoms (I recon my adrenaline/ cortisol levels have been very high throughout many years). 
 I still haven't got any answers on what this is from doctors and Im looking for the trigger. 
 Have anyone experienced something similar? What can this be? And have anyone experienced regrowth of eyebrows after they were almost gone/ gone?
