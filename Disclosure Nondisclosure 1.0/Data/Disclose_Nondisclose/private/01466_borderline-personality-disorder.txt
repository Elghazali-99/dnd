My wife has had four back surgeries and been on pain meds for a long time. The last pain meds she has been on are Duragesic 50mch patch and Norco 10 three a day for the last 4 years.
   Over a period of time she has started thinking we are being watched in our home, as in someone using cameras on cables like in the movies. She also thinks someone is coming into our attic and making noises, or under the floor making noises. Every kind of noise outside is someone doing something to either watch us or annoy us. She is coming up with some weird things.
   We live on a farm and not close to anyone else, in a two story house with an attic. I have checked out all these sounds and never find anything. She thinks "they" are watching us through the ceiling lights and electrical wall plug ins. She thinks they get on the roof to watch thru the windows or to listen,( It takes a latter to access the roof.) 
   She is clearly seeing and hearing things that aren't real. I told her pain doc and he took her off the patch and switched her to hydrocodone made up at a compounding pharmacy.
   I hope it was the medicine and she is not having some kind of mental break down.
Oh, and she stays awake all night listening for things. These are just some of the strange things she sees or hears.
Do you think it is the patch that just built up in her system? How long should it take for her to quit seeing and hearing these strange unreal things?
 Thanks for any help or input. This is my first time on this site and I'm not sure I posted in the right place.
