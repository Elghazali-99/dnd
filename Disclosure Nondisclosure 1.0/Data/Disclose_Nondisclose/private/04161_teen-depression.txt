Suicidal thoughts.
I'm about to kill my self
I can no longer bare this pain.
Please someone throw me,under a speeding train
Please someone shoot me,in the brain
Please someone,cut out my heart and release me of this pain.
Please someone,cut my wrists so life itself could drain.
Please let that someone be me,let me cry untill eternity.
The tears i shed are not for you,they are cause i'm desperate and don't know wat to do.
I hate you,yet i love you,i miss you,yet i despise you.
I wish you could see me,
I wish you could see me in your dreams,
screaming covered in blood with a hole in my chest were my heart used to be,
the image griffed into your memory for eternity.
Please let me rest,
let me be,
stop trying to contact me,
let this lonely girl cry alone without you to be there to comfort me.
When you try to reach me,
i feel like i'm dieing even more,
hearing your voice is like feeling the knife cutting my chest open in two,
taking away my heart while crying cause of you.
I used to be a shining star,
but now the light is fading away,
into darkness sadness and eternity
