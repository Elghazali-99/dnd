My son is 20 years old. He had 4.0 GPA at high school, but at college. he is doing poorly. He is enrolled as computer science major. He is not involved in partying or girls. The only interest he has is the video games. He does study, spends a lot of time in library for home work and preparing for the tests. But, his performance does not reflect his grades. He starts the semester on a positive note, then within a few weeks, starts getting bored, falling behind and loses all the interest. According to him, he is not motivated to do well and is not bothered about not getting good job or good money. He does not eat much but is over weight. His sleeping pattern is irregular and he prefers studying or playing video game at night. He also avoids going out, but he has good friends. We do go out as a family, but his first response will always be a 'No'. All our counseling is not helping him. One of his professors mentioned that he may be deficient in dopamine. What are your thoughts about it? Where can we get him tested? Does he have to go to a psychologist? I definitely need help as we are at our wits end to help him. If he has a medical condition which is the causal, we would love to know where to start. He has all our support and we want him to be successful. His elder brother graduated this year and is working in a good company. We have a good and positive relationship with each other. I am hoping to get a start from you. Please help! Thanks
