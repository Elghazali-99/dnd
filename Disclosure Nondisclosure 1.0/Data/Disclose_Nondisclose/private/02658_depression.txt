Hi. Okay so I really don't know when I started becoming depressed, I think it was around last year. I'm only 13 and I know most of you will say I'm too young to know what depression is, but I do... and I need help. My first experience was when I was sitting on my couch just watching TV and then I just got really sad. My parents were in bed so I couldn't really talk to anybody. I was like super sad and upset and had nothing to be sad about, and for some reason, I went on Google Images and searched things like "depression pictures" or "suicidal" "cutter", etc. All the pictures made me even more upset and I did something I shouldn't have done... I cut. It hurt.. but it also felt good. I felt fine and happy afterward. I continued to do it every day on my legs, since I wear pants everyday anyway and no one would see. 
    Ever since, I don't know, I've just been sad at school. I have amazing friends, I can laugh and be happy during the day, but I don't think it's real happiness anymore.. it's just fake. At night, if it's a school night, I just kind of look up at my ceiling and sometimes just cry silently. If it's not a school night and I'm alone, take tonight for example, I'm on my computer listening to music and searching sad things on Google.
     I've gotten really bad... I stopped cutting, in fact, I'm a few months clean, all of my scars are gone! A band helped me, I know that sounds ridiculous, but just go with me here. But I've just been horrible. I wrote my suicide note a hundred times. I have two saved on my computer, one for my family, and one for my best friend. I literally cry every night for no reason. I know how I'm going to kill myself if I get that far. And this needs to stop. Can someone help me please? I haven't told anybody about this, I can't. They'll think I'm a freak. And I cannot go to a psychiatrist.. my parents will kill me if they found out I'm depressed. I just need help... can someone help me? Please? Thank you.
