Hi, my daughter is 14 years old and her ex-boyfriend is 15. They meet at school and spent alot of time together for 6 weeks. He would come around alot and she met his whole family and they also went to a homecoming dance together. She liked him alot and always wanted to spent time with him, in which she has never done with another boy. They would text and talk everyday and even shared a locker at school so they could see each other more. They started to argue over little things and they broke up. She was hurt in the begining, but I think she is confused and mad now, because everyone is asking her why they broke up (including myself). I know it was a short time, but in that short time I become attached, he is a nice young man and I could see them together for a long time. I just feel they should be together (I just feel it in my heart, is this normal). They looked so happy together and now that they aren't I have shed many tears over this and I don't know why (I just wish they were together). She doesn't want another boyfriend for awhile and she said maybe they will get back together down the road, but who knows. He cared for her so much I feel she is giving up on somebody that she should be with, and ending up with someone else that doesn't care as much. Please give me some advice, I don't know why I'm hurting so much over this. She is tired of talking about it and that's the only way I feel better, so I understand what's going on.
