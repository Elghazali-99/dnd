My brother has just starting opening up to me about the abuse he lived through as a child.  We were all abused, but his situations were very different than mine.  He says he is in counseling, though I am not sure if this is true.  I have been reading (he has been sending letters) of the abuse and thought it would be ok to respond to him.  I in turn wrote him a letter saying what happened to him was not ok.  One example was as a young boy (under 10 years old) he would wander the streets in a very very bad neighborhood, and was picked up and paid by an older male to take inappropriate photos of him. This went on for at least a year.  My attempt was to make him understand that it was not ok for an adult to do this to him, but I believe he took the comment as a judgement on him.  How can I help him?  I find re-living our horrible past very upsetting, I have dealt with my past, and I want to be of help to him.  I do not find it healty to only listen to his stories and not try to make him see the harm that was done.  If he is not getting counseling, what would be the best way to help?  Should I just listen and not speak?  I truly belive he has no concept of unconditional love, so everything I want to say will be taken as a personal judgement.
 Please help me know the correct role to play in this situation.
