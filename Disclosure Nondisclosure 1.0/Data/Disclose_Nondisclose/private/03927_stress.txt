hi, I am quite skinny and have a 'fast metabolism', or so i'm told.Low blood pressure and an iron defficieny means I get dizzy alot and i'm always tired, I feel sick if I eat too much and i feel sick if i go too long without eating. some nights i cant sleep til around four in the morning. And some days I just don't want to get out of bed. I also have a three year old so I'm always running around and using energy that I just don't seem to have. I can go days without eating anything and just drink tea. the headaches are the worst because they never seem to fully go away, they just ease off but the tightness and throbbing is still there, just like a dull ache. I feel physically drained which then has an impact on me emotionally. I have back problems aswell so with that thrown in I feel like there is always something going on with me. Ive seen lots of different doctors and they just refer me to someone else and so on... I would really love some advice please, I want to be healthy and I enjoy food so i dont know where i'm going wrong!
