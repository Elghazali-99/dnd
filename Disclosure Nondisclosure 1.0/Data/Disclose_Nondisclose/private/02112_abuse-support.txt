I am a 22 year old female who lives at home with mom. My mother, who has five children, we all grew up together has raised us without our fathers. I am the second, I have an older brother. All my life my mother has treated me badly. When I was younger she would hit me, more then a normal spanking. She has never been affectionate towards me nor has she told me she loved me. Growing up she had a boyfriend who molested me, when she found out she smacked me and called me a liar. I was 11. At the age of 15 I started working. She would make me pay rent. It seems to me that she is only nice for convenience. I now am a mother of a four year old son, whom she loves dearly. She treats him like a king, I am not jealous but a little surprised because of our relationship. My aunts have told me that she has always been mean to me since I was born. Now I am 22, i consider myself a strong person however I still feel hurt from all the years of pain she caused me. Till this very day she is bipolar, sometimes I wonder if I should remove myself from her life and learn to live without a mother or appreciate the mother I have. Can anyone tell me why she treats me thus way? Or what kind of response I should give her???
