Hello, I am 17 years old and 12 weeks pregnant. Recently my partner of a year who is also the Father of this baby was imprisoned after assaulting and trying to injure me with a knife. It has been made very clear that I am not to have a relationship with him (which is something I do not want for the safety of my baby) otherwise the baby will go into Government care. When I first became pregnant I knew I wasn't going to be doing it alone, the Father had a long history of domestic violence and drug issues but he reassured me he would change.
I am just a little concern about becoming a single Mum, I really want to finish my last year of school which I was going to do with the help of the Father but there is a school where I can take my baby with me. I am now living with my Mum again but she is due to have her 5th child in November and their new house has only three kids bedrooms so there is no room for me, their new baby or my baby. I am a little lost, Mum is trying everything to make it all work and we have a lot of services but I think I need advice from other Mums.
Do you have any advice on what I should do? Is there anything I need to start preparing? What should I do about the Father?
