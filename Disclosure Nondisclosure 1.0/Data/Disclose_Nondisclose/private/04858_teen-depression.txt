Im 13, im extremely depressed, i know this is normal for my age but i want to commit suicide ALL THE TIME ive tried cutting myself, but i caan never get the scissors to go that far. Ive tried everything. From websites to taking a walk and ive tried to tell my mom but she dosnt care, she never has time for me, all she does is work. Im involved in a sport. I go places for it and stuff, and then she acts as if since she dropped me off, shes the best mom evr. I get bullied. Not that much tho i think its just worse because of my perfectionist personality. I use to be so happy. Mysister always is mean to me and she is in colledge! She says i complain a lot, and she says im a freak. It hurts me when my entire family is immitating me and teasing me. They go too far, im very sensitive tho. They dont even give me my meds when im sick. I cry myself to sleep all the time for so many reasons i have absolutly NOBODY to turn to. I know, not too long from now, i will go too far..i just am so lonely.. Nobody loves me anymore.
