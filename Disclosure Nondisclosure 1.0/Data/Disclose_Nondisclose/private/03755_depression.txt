I have been feeling this way for a while now! I feel completely sad and alone all the time...i feel as though i should just die cos nobody cares!! I often have thoughts of suicide or going asleep and never waking up!! I have self harmed for a while (with a scissors i just need to see blood an its enough no deep wounds but alot of bloody scratches) because i feel like death is the only way out of my misery...but then i thought maybe if i told my mum..we could get help and see if i am depressed but the thing is i am usually cranky (never getting enough sleep cant fall asleep) and we just lost our good relationship! I will talk to her but for lets say family events i will make an excuse not to go!! I dont have any friends...close friends i have acquaintances but not many as when i started high school (secondary school) i started feeling this way and isolated myself from everything! I have lost interest in things that used to matter to me!! I feel like i am not good enough and that i am ugly fat and the list goes on! I cry myself asleep at night (probably an hour or two) and am always tired and have no energy! 
 I want to be back to my own bubbly self! 
Please help
 Oh and to my family i am a good child and its just hormones but i think its more!!!
