I am 58 years old, have had an endometrial ablation, D&C; and polypectomy in 2010.  I've had 4 biopsies (latest one end of January 2014, 2 sonohysterograms, countless pelvic/TV ultrasounds since.  I was given Provera (10 mgs for 5 1/2 MONTHS) last October (2013) to thin the lining.  All biopsies no signs of cancer, pre-cancer or hyperplasia.  I bled heavily and was so anxious that I felt paranoid.  I came off of it mid-March of this year.  Now the gynecologist wants me to take it again for 14 days every 3 months to produce a shedding of the lining until my estrogen levels normally drop.  My family doc gave me a prescription for Prometrium (200 mgs) because I was terrified of taking the Provera again due to side effects and heavy bleeding.  Any information on how one feels while taking Prometrium (vs Provera) and whether it works to bring on a flow but, not a flood?  I'm confused and cannot get my OBGYN by phone or even and appointment to talk to her.  Any help would be much appreciated.  This discussion is related to Are Bio-Identical Hormones Drugs?.
