Hi,I got married 4years back.I love my husband and love to spend time with him and share my happiness and sad with him.BUT there were situations which made him to take chance on me by sharing my weak points to him.I trusted him a lot more than my parents.But as days passing on,I came to know that he is telling all personal matters also to his parents.Whatever discussion happens between us,every small thing also would go immediately to his mom and dad .which I dont like.Even if he wants to purchase a scissors also,he take permission from his dad.Everything he is dependant on his dad.If I say that why you are so dependant,he will shout at me saying that I am like this only.Even if I discuss anything also,he will just scold me with vulger words that who are you to ask me.he will say that you dont have any right to ask me.Its me and my dad who shld discuss and decide he says.He started beating me also.For first few days I kept quite even if he is scolding vulger words and even if he is beating but my patience reached its saturation point after 2 yrs after marriage bcos he beat me during my pregnancy also .That too before his parents.I complained to them but they took it as a chance and instead scolding him they started dominating me and demanding me.If I say my husband abt this,in turn he is scolding me.Everytime when he gets the call from his parents he beats me for all silly reasons.Everytime when we meet face to face,my in-laws says me somemthing and if i say my husband he dont believe me.If I stop telling him what is happening ,they are creating scenes themselves and making my husband anger on me.I went to my mom place for 2months and he didnt call me bcos his mom told not to call(she told before me only when m leaving).After 2months my parents reached their parents and his father asked to call me so my husband called me after taking permission from his father.I came back home with my kid but my husband is still the same and situation became more horrible.Its clealry knowing that my husband anger is bcos of his parents but how can i save our relation from their parents.They are main culprits in our relationship.And offcourse even my husband should know what is true and what is worng.He cant believe blindly and fight with me.Many times I discussed with him ,that why you dont bother abt me and my concerns.He just says OK but from 4yrs in all the embarassing situations i faced alone with my in laws.My husband never nderstood me and never supported me.Please help me suggesting on this.How should I proceed further.Thanks
