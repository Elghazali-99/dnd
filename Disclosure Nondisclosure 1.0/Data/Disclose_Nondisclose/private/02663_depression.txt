Dear,
This post is regarding my mother, who is 58 year's old. This all started after her removal of ovary around 2 years back, initially she started complaining about constant stomach pain, we started seeing different doctors, all the MRI / CT scan done but nothing found in it, since 2 years their no relieve to her. we changed to different doctors from general physician to, Medicine Sp to Gastro Sp. Slowly we started observing that, this is not about stomach pain but some thing related to brain cause, below are the observation made by us (we may be totally wrong)
1. She feels ok, when ever their is a change in medicine (for few days), than same cont.
2. She constantly chews, even if their is nothing in mouth.(we have never observed such in past)
3. She always, seat with her hand on her head, as if their is some problem in her head.
4. Tough she is physically fit, but while walking she is requiring a support,(even we object than she could walk freely without any support)
5. absent mindedness, constant need for taking rest, not willing to talk to anybody etc developed recently.
 Is these are symptoms of psychological / depression etc, if yes what shall we do now ? (we would be really glad if the ans is no. & we are overestimating our thoughts)..
  Please help us....
