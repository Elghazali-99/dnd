hey
ive been with my partner for  nearly 6 years, he was in the army for 10 before i met, he has ex wife and a 8 yr old he actually lost a child to his ex.
im typing about i think emotional and physical abuse, i know he has been through and seen alot of things so far but we have arguments about simple things and he screams shouts in my face and times hurt me at first i would cower and be upset now i hit out back at him which ends up in further physical  fights,
to other he is a fun easy going guy and when we are out together this is true but he kind of switches from the smallest things like 'i left the key in the door' or ' i take to long to pick out veg' or not sure what i wanna do for the weekend' just simple things make him fly off the handle, 999 was called by a neighbour actually as he was strangling me i dropped charges through him crying saying he was sorry but a while after he actually does not think he did owt wrong or doesn't want to believe it, a lot of times it gets put back on me and then i wonder well is it, but i know its not but he still gives that doubt do i make him like this for being a little dumb, recently my sister witnessed it when he began an argument over a bombing on the internet which i didnt agree with i was making breakfast he screamed in my face threatening 'answer again and you'll know about it' and 'speak when spat at' this is his what i call 'army head' i had to walk out with her and my niece in bits she was horrified.
however when things are good they are great but i think he needs help to talk about things but without going to docs is there any help services about.
thanks
