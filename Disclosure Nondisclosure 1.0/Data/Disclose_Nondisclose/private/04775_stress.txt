Hello, I wanted to ask about Hypoglycemia and panic attacks. A few weeks ago I collapsed. I was under a lot of stress and had only had carbs for breakfast. Minus a bloody lip and face, I was ok. I am having lab work done. 
Six years ago, the doctors diagnosed me with GAD and put me on 10 mg of lexapro. I threw up the lexapro the first time I took it. I cut down to 2.5 mg and stayed on it for six years. In the fall of 2007, I was sexually harassed and assaulted in the workplace and began having panic attacks. I bumped my lexparo up to 5 mg. After about a year, I felt like the lexapro turned against me. I began having reoccurring thoughts of death, panic, insomnia, etc. 
I saw an MD who instructed me to discontinue the lexapro, immediately. He put me on Somnolin (blend of nutrients, including 5-HTP, theanine, and targeted B vitamins). Additionally, I have a protein shake every morning (whey's protein, vitamin c, omegas) and have been feeling better. 
 For the last three months, I wake up every morning with what feels like a heart beating in my stomach! I can see it moving. When I apply pressure, the butterflies goes away. If I exercise, it goes away. Is there a muscle that runs from about the rib cage to the naval? Where is the pancreas?
