I am a widow: going on 16 months. I have been dating a new guy for 5 almost 6 months and I have a small child, 
 Awhile ago my boyfriend and I got into a hue fight ( two months ago) we went through a hard time for about a month. He said that he didn't know if he ever pictured himself marrying me out of anger. In my eye there is no reason to date if there is no future such as marriage especially because I have a child,, 
 Things got worked out and we haven't even had an argument since. I randomly last night asked my boyfriend if he ment what he said or was it out of anger and he said he felt te same way he is not sure if he sees marriage in our future, my thing is why continue a relationship? He am I talked this morning on his work break and e kept telling me he didn't want to loose me or my son but why continue something that has no future for us. Am I being unreasonable? I'm not and have said. I'm not saying lets get married next week. But in the next 3,5,10 whatever years do you see yourself marrying me ? I just don't know what to do. I guess it's just hard because after my loss in 2010 its hard to think of loosing someone else...
