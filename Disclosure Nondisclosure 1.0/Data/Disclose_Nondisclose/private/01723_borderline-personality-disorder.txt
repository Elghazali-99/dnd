My wife and I have two boys age 3 and 2. She has been diagnosed with BPD for the past year but has signed of it since I met her six years ago. I just thought she was immature and that I could " coach" her through. I soon found out how wrong I was. 8 months ago she left with our sons while I was at work.. This was a week or so after being admitted to hospital for suicide ideation. 10 months ago She filed restraining order and accused me of abusing her, which was dismissed, she also accused me of molesting our son, who had just turned 3. Which she denies but it's part of his health record I got from his pediatrician. This was because she believed I was going to divorce her.. I took her back, partly because I missed my boys so much. Now she is suicidal again. She is leaving all of us today to go live with her father and get in a DBT group about 60 miles from us.. I am so tired of all the drama and watching our boys suffer. I love her but she is rouining my career and chance to care for our boys. Question is.. Should I stay or file for separation. Just don't know what to expect from her in the future. Sad that my boys just couldn't have a "normal" life.. Actually it makes me mad.
