My husband is 32.  He has had a recurrent pain in the front part of his left rib cage area.  The pain started at least a year ago and would come, last for a few days, then go away.  He thought it was a rib injury, because he did wrestling type sports so he didn't see a doctor.  He finally went to a doctor 2 days ago, a chest xray showed something cloudy on the left side of his rib cage.  He had a contrast CT today which, per his MD, showed a mediastinal tumor.  He will see a cardio-thoracic surgeon for consultation and probably a biopsy in 4 days.  We are obviously scared due to lack of information, not knowing if this can be benign or not.  The pain in his ribs was in the anterior, mid portion of left rib cage area, slightly more towards the bottom.  Does this automatically mean it's anterior tumor?  We read about those and they seem very likely malignant.  Our questions are, what are the chances of this type of tumor being benign vs. malignant?  If malignant, what are his chances for treatment, considering he has none of the symptoms we saw on websites (i.e. fever, chills, night sweats, etc).  The only symptom he ever had was the pain.  His doctor did do an ekg and blood work to rule out cardiac cause, and those were all normal.  Not sure what lab work was done.  Could the CT be wrong and there's nothing there?  This seems unlikely to me, since he is having pain in the area.  We just can't wait for next week to find out.  Any info will help (hopefully).  We are stressed and the timing can't be worse cause we're expecting a baby any week now.
