I was sexually abused as a child. I think I was about 8 or 9 years old. My step father sexually abused me and I can't seem to get over this traumatic situation. I know your thinking how can I get over something like this? I mean this is critical to me. But, I think it's even more critical right after I told my mom. I was around 9 or 10 years old, my step dad who has been living with us since I was almost born, went to jail for a day but he had money to bail out. And I couldn't see him for 2 years. But then he came back to live with us and I just find the whole situation absolutly crazy. Nothing happened after he came back to live with us. But HOW can my mom live with someone like that? I think because she was pregnant with his child. She ended up having twins. And she had no money and no place to go and thats why she ended up staying with him. I developed a "decent" relationship with my step dad all my life and I never knew he would do something like this to me or that it would affect me as I am older now. I'm 23 years old and I see him til this day. He never touched me again after all what has happened. But I have an immense amount of hate towards him. But then I do love him like a father figure in a twisted way. And my question is, how do I go about being strong and just keeping this situation in the back of my mind? Not thinking about it all the time and not let it get to me. I guess, I would like to cope with this the best way possible.
 Thank you for your time.
