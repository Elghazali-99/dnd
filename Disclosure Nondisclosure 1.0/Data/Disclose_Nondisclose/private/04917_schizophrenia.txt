Hello I'm new to the group but have read a lot and tonight experience by first full blown delusional episode My boyfriend was diagnosed over 4 years ago after trying Meth for the first time and that was the trigger or the on switch! Tonight was was only slightly surprising because the change was in an instant almost, I knew he was struggling. There's been a few changes, first off there was occasional Meth use, which angered me even more after finding out it was the initial trigger, when he felt he was overwhelmed and couldn't focus he was put on Vyvance starting at 20mg working up to 60mg taken in the morning where is now and 20mg Abilify nightly. But The Abilify isn't working anymore at all! Not sure if it's because of the Vyvance but he definitely has compulsive tendencies especially towards drugs but not gambling I link it to the Abilify because he wasn't like that before.
Latuda sounds like it might a good try, we talk very openly about things. He did try to cut back the goal was 7.5mg and was down to 10mg a day Abilify daily but it was too low, 15mg was enough he admitted later that is was because of weight gain, I also think he was occasionally using Meth so he would focus on work and not eat, this led to the ADHD diagnosis. There's no question the Meth caused a significant change and the Vyvance is basically prescription form. I see some have reported Latuda has helped with ADHD as well so that;s a plus. His big concern is whether he can just switch or will he have to stop Abilify and wait to start Latuda once it out of his system. It's been a year of him working or sleeping. So it would be great to see if something else will help after tonight, I wonder if he will remember anything tomorrow.
 So that is my question I would like some feedback on changing from Abilify to Latuda.
 Thanks !
