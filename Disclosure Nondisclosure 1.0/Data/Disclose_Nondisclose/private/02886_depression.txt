I've had depression and anxiety for about 2 years, but over time, they're both steadily getting worse, especially lately, the depression has been a lot to handle, causing frequent anxiety attacks (at least 2 a day). I'm currently taking antidepressants and seeing a therapist. I want to get better, I want to be healthy for him and be the girl he really deserves. But it's hard to think that way.
Anyway, my boyfriend and I have been together for a year now. I'm crazy for him and I trust him so much, I always go to him when I'm having my depressive episodes. Lately, he says he feels like he's been repeating himself, saying the same things when trying to make me feel better. So due to this, he hasn't really been supportive. I feel like he's getting tired of me, which I would understand. He's a completely healthy guy. I treat him terribly sometimes, I can be such a burden. I'm trying my best to stop going to him for support because I think I'm overwhelming him. I just don't know what to do anymore, can I salvage this relationship? How can I make things better? How can I be better for him? I've suggested taking a break or even breaking up so that he could be happy, so he wouldn't have to be with someone as miserable as me, but he says no, he loves and cares too much. I'm so lucky to have him, but I don't deserve him. Please help me, I feel like I'm losing my mind.
