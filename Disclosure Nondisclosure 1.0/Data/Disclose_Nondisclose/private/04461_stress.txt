I have a sinus infection as a result of a bad cold before this past Christmas...my armpits ache and previously went to the doctor for this and he said they looked fine and didnt feel anything abnormal...am I to attribute this to the sinus infection...still feeling maliase and run down but the headaches and running nose are gone but still spit up yellow pghlem.I am very anxious and have some hypochondria.I have had ecurring sinus infections since this past Sept. I am  a 44 year old male and the only other thing I take is valium 5 mg ...the avelox 400 mg that I have taken two 7 day coursed of recently I can no longer take as it effects my heart rate now...my ent switched to levaqin 500 mg and that also was no good for me...floroquines are not tolerated well anymore by me either now...when I did go to the ENT before the new year he scoped me and saw puss in the nasal cavity and diagnosed another sinus infection brought on by the bad cold I had prior to Christmas. I spoke to my GP says too much antibiotics and now have stopped taking them altogether.Any advise?
