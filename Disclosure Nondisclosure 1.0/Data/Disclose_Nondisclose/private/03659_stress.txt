Friday i got off work and when i laid down after taking a shower i started to twitch in my arms and chest really bad. I stood and it felt like i was going to pass out so i stumbled my way out to my sister and told her something was wrong. when she got up my arms started to shake violently and then i was hystericly crying. she called my mom and told her and two seconds later i fell on the floor and shook violently. i could not control my arms and it felt like my body was on fire. i was in intense pain and when given a drink of water. the right side of my mouth would not close. then i was ok. my dad said i had an anxiety attack. but saturday night it happend again but without the crying and falling on the floor. it was just violent uncontrolable shakes in my arms. and my fingers were locked into crooked positions. this happend 6 times that night. i had the same thing when i woke up this morning twice. seven at work and twice just now. my dad says they are just muscle spasms. but i dont think so. any ides?
