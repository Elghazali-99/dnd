I'm a SO in Highschool, 15 years old. For the past few years I've been in a foggy state of mind, use to be an A student now I'm straight F's and got held back in all my classes. I'm getting sick of this feeling of hopelessness and lifeless but I can't figure out whats up with me and not sure what to do.. I've had a great life so far(other than this feeling), short but great, and I hope to live long and healthy. No clue why I get these depressed thoughts of just giving up, but lately I'm fed up with it, three years of it with no help from anyone has bee nlong enough. If I am Bi-polar (which runs in the family, my grandmother has it) will meds really help? I always see crazy stories of someone snapping from them, doing some crazy stuff...which is the last thing I would want to do... and if they do help me, will smokin marijuana effect me in anyway, if I was using meds and THC mixed with it? Smoking has definitely helped me throughout these past three years, I'm not a heavy smoker, few times a week, but it does relieve a lot of this feeling and usually I'll have a good time with my pals, just listenin to the Beatles or Petty and lighting up...But I feel this can't go on forever, I need to get priorities straight, get back to the life I use to have.
