Im 23 and ive been a mother for only 5 years now, and when i got pregnant i battled with wanting to keep the baby or giving the baby away... but i decided, i layed down and helped make this baby i will keep the baby. and i go through stages where I think im doing good, but then i go through stages where i dont think i can really handle being a mother, and dont want to be a mother anymore. I will lose ALL patience, wich isnt many! and my daughter will just get on my ever lasting nerve to the point to where im like just shut up and get out of my face. and then somedays ill watch her play and i will feel so guilty, and think of how im most likely ruining her life because im an awwful person, and i should have given her up for aboption because she could have gotten a great mom with all the patience in the world and didnt take anger out on her. Im not only like this with her.. but my mother as well... but im more concerned with my daughter, i mean when im angery i dont care who you are im RAGED with anger and i will literally cuss my mther out in front of my daughter... and if shes sees me act like that toward my mother she will do the same to me! My question is... Why am I so mean to the ones that love me the most!
