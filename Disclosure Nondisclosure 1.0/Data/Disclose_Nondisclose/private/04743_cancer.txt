Yesterday my dermatologist informed me that the scrape biopsy she did on my upper right arm a week or so ago came back as the following: Skin: upper tight arm; invasive Malignant Melanoma, Nevoid Type, Breslow Depth 0.6mm, Clark's level 111 with Involved Peripheral Margins. Under Comment: Step level sections show epidermal consumption and a poorly circumscribed compound melanocytic proliferation. The dermal melanocytes demonstrate significant cytologic atypia and I see no maturation with increase in dermal depth. There are numerous mitotic figures. The findings are most consistent with an invasive malignant melanoma nevoid type. The Breslow depth is 0.6mm and the Clark's level is 111. A lymphocytic host response is present but not brisk. The mitotic rate is 4 per mm2. I see no lymphovascular invasion or ulceration. 
PLEASE EXPLAIN:
1. invasive Malignant Melanoma, Nevoid Type
2. The dermal melanocytes demonstrate significant cytologic atypia
3.  A lymphocytic host response is present but not brisk
thank you
