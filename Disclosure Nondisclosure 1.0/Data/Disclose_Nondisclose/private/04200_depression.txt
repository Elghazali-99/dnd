I am a 33 year old man. Not sure what my illness is exactly. For the past 9 years I have been extremely tired all the time. I dont sleep well, maybe 5-7 hours of broken sleep. I never have any energy, nor any drive to do anything. This has caused depression and anxiety. I also have digestive issues: bloating, constipation, diarreah, just overall there is no regulation. I sometimes get bouts of digestive distress before having to be somewhere, whether its a social gathering or work. This has caused me to not be able to hold down a job, and basically has caused me to lose almost all of my friends because I never feel up to going out. But the main problems are the fact that I am always tired and can't go a week without some form of digestive distress. I have had numerous blood tests for things like lupus, h. py lori, diabetes, thryroid, vitamin deficiency, etc. I have also gotten endoscopy and colonscopy both not showing anything. Ive had an MRI of the brain and ultrasound of the adomin. Nothing ever showing anything.
I should also mention that I was diagnosed with Celiac in 2001. But I am very strict with my diet and try very hard not to consume any gluten. My most recent tests show that my gluten levels are as low as they can be.
What else should I be tested for? What could it be? Fibromayasia? Chronic Fatigue? I'm at a loss.
