I'm not really sure if this is a question, more of a realization or a statement. I'm a 15 year old girl and I think I may have depression, but I can't tell whether I'm just jealous, bitter, sad, angry, helpless, tired and irritable all at once....and that's not depression, surely - that's just the average range of human emotion. 
 I have felt so helpless over the past few weeks - and this may sound horrible - but I think I've become this way because of other people. It's not that they're door anything to put me down, it's just that they're all so happy. They have successful relationships and plans for the future and bestfriends and things to do; I just feel like I deserve that, don't I? I feel like I'm invisible; I've stopped eating often, I've felt the urge to cut, I've attempted burning myself with a lighter, I've stayed away from social activities, I've tried smoking and I've cried for no apparent reason.
 I sound so bitter when I read this back to myself, but I feel I need to write about this or it will never go away. But, from my understanding of these things, they don't just...go away. What worries me is that I'm either seriously depressed and am brushing it off as a stupid phase, or that I am not depressed at all, but am just amplifying my situation. I don't know if I'm depressed and the only solid evidence that I am comes from the results of my online 'diagnoses'. 
 In conclusion, I'm not sure if this is a valid question, but, how do you tell if you're truly, legitimately suffering from depression? Or can you just be experienced a short bout of it? Can it be brought on by certain life situations? 
 Any answer is welcome, any opinion, I don't care what it is. Thanks.
