I keep feeling low and it's really making me feel terrible.
 - I was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism in Jan 2014. Endocrinologist has said I have clinical presentations of hyperpigmentation along with weight loss but an adrenal test has shown I do not have adrenal fatigue despite losing weight and showing hyperpigmentation. So that has made me think I am making all of this up.
 - I left my job over a year ago due to how poorly I have felt along with the fact that my boss did not understand my illness. Looking back I did not have to leave my job at all as I could have received support/help but the surgery I was previously registered with did not diagnose me with hypothyroidism, only generalised anxiety/depression. It was only when I was found to have hypothyroidism and after I had left my job months later that I could have contacted my employer's human resources department to be better accommodated.
 - My boyfriend does not believe in mental illness even though he himself suffered depression in the past. He does not like me taking anti-depressants/SSRIs and does not like it when I go to the doctor about ongoing problems I have.
 - I was signed up with 2 health forums, both of which another member was signed up with. She has accused me of lying to other people as I omitted reasons why I did not take my thyroid medication. It was due to the above reasons as well as having to treat the adrenal issues first before thyroid ones that I stopped taking my medication.
 I now feel as though my reasons are completely unjustified and I feel like I should be locked up somewhere right now.
 Thanks
