My parents divorced when I was 4 and my brother was 2.  My father got custody.  When I was 9 he remarried a woman with a 10 year old son and a 4 year old daughter.  After they married they had two more sons.  My stepbrother sexually abused me for all the years I was in that house.  As soon as I turned 18 I left.  My family is one who just pretends that things have not happened and we all have had rough times in our lives and I have just found out that my stepbrother abused all of us.  We have all reacted differently and none of us have talked about it to each other.  My father passed away a few months ago.  It would kill my stepmother to know what happened.  My stepbrother has never apologized for his actions.  I have learned that he was sexually abused by his father and stepmother and have forgiven him in my heart.  Now that I know he has hurt so many others it is really bothering me.  Again, no one says anything.  
 In your experience it is best to bring this out?  Do we wait until my stepmother passes?  Part of me wants to scream it out but don't want to hurt my stepmother or force the others to publicly recognize the abuse.  Not sure what to do here.
