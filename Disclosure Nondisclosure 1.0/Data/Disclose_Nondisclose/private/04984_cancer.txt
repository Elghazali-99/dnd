Hi there, so basically for the past 4 years I have had a hard immovable lump latched in to the back of my ear and through months of online searching I have came to the conclusion of an encapsulated sarcoma. This lump is smooth and has never grown or changed shape in any way. the nodes nearby have also always been enlarged. I have seen countless doctors about this and absolutely not one is concerned about anything in the area. I feel this is because the lump itself is actually hard to feel for as its in the groove behind your ear. But I've seen specialists too, an oncologist and an ENT specialist and both weren't concerned. I am so certain that this is cancer though as I don't know what else it can be(due to the Internet) that I have pushed it to the point where the ENT doctor is referring me for a CT scan on the mastoid region.his words were, "I am 100% certain nothing sinister will show up in this scan and you can see me a couple days after it and I will give you absolute reassurance. There is no way you have a sarcoma in that region as there is as much chance of me having one there as their is you, never in my 15 years as an ENT surgeon have I ever heard or seen a sarcoma of the mastoid process" I should take complete reassurance from that but I know I will prove everyone wrong as I just truly don't know what else it could be regardless of no growth or change.
