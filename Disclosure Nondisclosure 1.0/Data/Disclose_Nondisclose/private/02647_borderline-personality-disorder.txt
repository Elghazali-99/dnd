I was recently diagnosed wit border line personality and anxiety. I believe the doctor also said something about being manic. He prescribed me geodon 20mg once daily. I have been on this medication for two weeks now and I have recently started seeing things. I have never seen things on or off medication in my life so I'm really worried.When I look at an image it will sort of melt in a way- or make waves. Its not dramatic but it is there. And then out of the corner of my eye I sometimes see what looks like someone walking by very quickly, but no one is there. I am also getting these strange feelings of being watched, like some one is breathing down the back of my neck. I'm freaking out.It's only at night time, or if I am alone. any other time I am fine. Something is telling me that this medicine is making me see whats really there, things that I cant sense while off this medication.Besides this strange "side effect" that I am having, the geodon is working great for my manic spells and depression. I guess my question is- Could geodon be making me see these things and feel this way? It is the only medicine that has fixed my border line symptoms so I rely don't want to switch my meds....mabey I should wait until I'm on it longer?
