I´ve been having serious problems with GAD for years now, and it has always been charactarazied by lots of psyical symptoms. As of late things seems to have escalated tremendously, and I am now at  a point of more or less not being able to get out of bed. 
 For some reason my physical symptoms seems to be worse on my left side (non-parkinsonian tremor and stiffness of fingers).
 Although, the most debilitating symptoms is a stiffness in almost every set of muscles, but most notably in my calves, shinbones (the support muscles there) and lower back. This has also resulted in really poor ankle mobility, especially in my left foot, and severly reduced dorsiflexion (that too in my left foot). My left foot also tends to fall inwards.
 Years ago, before developing all of these symptoms, I underwent a rather thourough Neurexamination (because of functional weakness, numbness etc, mostly prominent in the left side of body). 
 Several Doctors concluded that I suffer from hemsensory conversion disorder or something along those lines.
 My question now is, can a constant GAD (and severe hypochondria from my OCD) really cause tremors (intermittent, mostly during high stress/anxiety) and severe muscular tensions that severly restricts movement?
 If so, what can I do to regain control of my body?
 I am an sligtly overweight (+65lbs from ideal weight), inactive 27 year old male. My current diagnoses is GAD/OCD/Depression/hemisensory conversion disorder. My only medications now is Lyrica (300mg/day).
 Please help me with this, it is literally killing me
