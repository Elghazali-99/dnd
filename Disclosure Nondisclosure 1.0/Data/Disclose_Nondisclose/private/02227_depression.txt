My best friend that ive known for over 10 years has been really depressed these past few months and ive talked to her and with her and i dont know what to do, shes transgender (mtf) and gets called the wrong name and pronoun almost everywhere she goes, whether at school or when shes ordering food and the person behind the counter calls her sir, ive called her and messaged her on snapchat and half the time i do shes crying thinking about things shes done 5-10 years ago in the past, i dont know why but shes told me that she really misses the early 2000's, so much so i came to her house while she was crying to the ending credits of the spongebob movie and she kept telling me that she would do anything to go back to 2004 when life was simple, she loves cars and has an old camaro in her garage that she told me shes "restomodding" but i havent seen any progress done on that car in over 4 months, she always details her other cars but they look really dirty and to see her car dirty is a very rare thing, she hardly goes out like she used to, she wont talk to anybody that she dosent know, she refuses to get into relationships, she deleted her facebook and says that humans are evil and that earth is a ball of cancer, i dont know why shes acting like this! Shes usually full of joy and the happiest and most loving and kind person you'll ever meet, i just dont know what to do
