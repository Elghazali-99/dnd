So first off sorry for my english its not my native language
also get ready for a long read...cause u get the full story i hope for some good help/advice
cause noone in other forums seems to take me serious ;(
 OK so now i will explain how my problems came to be i  try to keep it short but thats not really possible because
i wanna give you guys the most detailed view on the situation for some advise or in the best case someone that 
expirienced similar things and can tell me its going to go away.
 it was  april 2014 was feeling good and just minded my own things i used to smoke some weed every now and then not really much like 1-2x every week at best sometimes nothing for 2-3weeks then my holidays came and i had  2 weeks off so i wanted to celibrate with my friends got myself some 25i nbome its a drug with similar effects to lsd
 the first time i took it after like 3-4 months didnt really feel good i was kinda off in my head turned on rihanna usually i never listen to her but oh well seemed right for that time.. the trip was not horrible but not really what i wanted it to be..so the next day i desided to try it again and this time it was perfect loved everything about it ate some chillis they tasted like rainbows.
 these 2 trips took place right after eachother then i had a 3 day break my friend had some XTC or MDMA crystals 
at first i was scared to take them we all met for smoke a couple joints but noone really had the guts to take the molly 
so i took it home with me at about 21 o clock i desided to just take it whatever while still being a little high from the weed.
 the high was great i have never felt something like this before i was filled with love just laying in bed not moving atall
after 2 hours the high seemed to go away so i took a little more not really much
that was the time i desided to write the girl i was always in love with yeah i know how stupid that sounds
but i did it... wrote such a long text at 1-2 at night lol
 the high was gone i felt fine could even sleep well
 the next day i woke up feeling a little off but thats to be expected so its all good till now 
this day my friends call me and say yooo lets smoke some weed and well since i have nothing better to do except 
playing video games i said yes while still feeling drained 
 smoked like 2-3gs with 3 people all good
 at night my head starts to hurt really bad i had that about 2-3 time before so i just taught meh and went to bed
 this is where it gets wierd
