I'm not sure if this is an anxitey disorder, it just recently occured this previous week.  I feel as if it's passed right now. This was my week:
         Mon- Slept all Day
                 Very dizzy, lightheaded
                  Feeling very confused almost as if in a dream all day.
                  Hard to concentrate on what people were saying (litterally, the words coming out of their mouth made no sense).
         Tues- Same as monday
         Wed- Same as Mon only worse at night (work night shift)
         Thur- Worst Day Ever!!!!  
My mother woke me up at 3:30 p.m., wanting to test my blood pressure and heart rate.  Blood pressure was very high, not sure exactly sure where, (mother's alseep) heart rate was 112. Went to family doctor. Doctors saying I was twitching, very pale and lifeless. They did blood work, EKG and nothing was found.  I did a 24 hour urine, haven't received results. 
 No vommiting, no chest pains, no stomach pains, no headaches, no aching at all,  
 Not sure if this is the right forum.  Am I overreacting? Should I be worried?
