i am grown up man now .the tought that i am just makes me feel even more depressed. i just miss my childhood so much. the best time of my life. waking up everyday , no problems, no responsibilities, nothing. just living the life.
 now its different.. it just feels like... not the same anynmore
 is this normal? sometimes i cry that i cant go back into time ever again and this makes me even more sad then i am.
i just cant let this go. when i hear a song that i heard 15 years ago or see a movie, i suddenly remember my childhood..
and it strikes me with all different emotion, some of are nostalgia. 
 i believe i was more happier when i was a kid, without even realizing how good life was. school, everything, friends.
 now my friends are becoming parents, this feels unreal. the tought that we are all changing.. sometimes it just hurt, but nothing last forever. im just confused... i looked at my old photos , found stuff and toys that i had like 15 years ago... and that made.. well have you experienced anything like this. i believe that when you get older you start to think moreabout the past then into the future... 
 im not saying this makes me depressed, but it brings some very strong emotions.
i had a very good and sucessful childhood by the way.
