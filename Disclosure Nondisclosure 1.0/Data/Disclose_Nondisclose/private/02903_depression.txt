I was doing some light reading and came across some interesting research. I hope to obtain an expert’s opinion on this:
 My conclusion (please verify) is: The imbalance of gut bacteria affects mental health such as mood, behavior and psychological disorders (anxiety and depression).
 This claim done was based on some findings that while 5% of our ‘happy hormone’ serotonin is found in our head, 95% is produced in the gut by good bacteria. In some research, animals who lack gut bacteria exhibit high anxiety-like behaviors while another concluded that gut bacteria may influence mammalian early brain development and behavior, indicating bidirectional communication between our gut and brain.
 It was also pointed that our brain and gut are created out of the same type of tissue, where one becomes our central nervous system while the other our enteric nervous system. Even so, they are connected by vagus nerves, explaining how our nervousness translates to butterflies in our tummy.
With 95% of happy hormone produced by our gut, it has been interestingly referred as our “second brain”.
 Some has even gone so far as to relate such findings into exercise and fitness. One such study conducted found that the ratio of certain good / bad bacteria strains were significantly different among obese and lean persons, and that subsequent weight loss by the obese group resulted in a confident swing in ratios towards more good bacteria.

Are the above true and none from bogus studies? If valid, does this also mean that apart from stimulating endorphins, creation of new neurons and providing that psychological feel good factor to make us happier, exercise also additionally promotes a healthy gut which then secretes more happy hormone? Or it may not be a casual effect? I’m very curious. Please offer your opinions. Thanks!
