I need my son to leave the house now.  he has untill 8:30 am tomorrow  to make a decision between having a healthy positive respectful adult relationship with me, his mother, or leave.  I am going to trial for divorce from his father Sept. 22,2008 and I need to stay as healthy and positive as humanly possible.  I explained to my son that I need love support kindness and compassion cooperation from him by getting a job, cleaning up after himself in the house, help with chores around the house, etc. and that if he was unwilling to offer those things that I need him to leave and go stay with his father or a friend.  He flattly refused standing a foot taller that me. I spoke to a police officer to learn about what my legal options were.  He vacilates between disrespectful and abusive with me and constantly challenges my self esteem.  Please assist me with an idea I can put into practice immediately.  I need my home environment to be serene, warm and loving with or without him  ---   but it must be now!
