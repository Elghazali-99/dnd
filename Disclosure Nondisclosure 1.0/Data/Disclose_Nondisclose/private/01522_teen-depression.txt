I am seventeen years old and I have been constantly pondering on getting old, turning 80-90. I'm depressed because I fear I will miss being young... I want to maintain good health and not look younger, but look my best as I age. I've seen Phyllis Sues who looks great at 90. But WHY am I worrying about this? Is this normal? I would also want to mention I am on my period... And I tend to overthink things and stress a lot when it is my time of the month. Am I overreacting? Honestly, I've never been afraid of old age and never thought I would be miserable as an old woman. I always thought I would be ready to be the age I become and not worry about the things that worry me now, that my appearance won't matter to me by then, and I will be content with other beautiful things in life. But now I feel that I'll be getting old in no time and that I won't be able to enjoy my youth for long, because I love being young now. Do I have a long time before I get old? And will I be happy? I know being happy is ultimately up to me, but do the elderly enjoy life just as much as young people? And will there be better things to look up to as an older person?
