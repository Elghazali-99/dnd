I've never been treated for BPD. There's something frightening about change, even if for the better. At this point in my life, I can see clearly how this disorder is making life more difficult than need be for the people who are close to me and I know I need help. However, I'm worried that the medication could interfere with creativity... I worry that my art, writing and music might change... losing parts of my personality or things that make me *me*... even though some of those traits can make me a real difficult jerk sometimes. I'm not proud of that part of myself, but I'm also fearful of letting my guard down and becoming a push-over or a door mat... or worse, an over-medicated zombie that just doesn't give a damn about what's happeing around me. I know that may sound silly or ridiculous, but it's something that has gotten in the way of seeking out therapy or taking any sort of medicine to even out my temper. I'm just wondering if anyone else out there has had any similar issues regarding therapy. Any thoughts on the matter are most welcome. Thanks for taking the time to read this.
