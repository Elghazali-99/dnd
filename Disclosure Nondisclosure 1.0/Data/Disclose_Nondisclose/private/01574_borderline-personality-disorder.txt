I feel so alone, I can not stop crying and thinking about suicide. I have been writing poetry about killing myself and printing images off the internet of death and people who have killed themselves. I just want this pain to go away. I have suffered a mental illness since I was 10 I have seen numerous doctors and had many differant diagnoses. I have had really bad problems with my parents recently and had to change my number and get away from them being able to reach me or message me. I have trouble leaving my house and seeing people face to face because I hide my face and can not talk. I tried to get help but no one is around and I feel so alone. My doctor wants to put me on an anti depressant with my current medication which is seroquel but she wants me to see someone and the only person available is a male and I have problems talking face to face with anyone especially males. I can write really well and explain myself but I can not talk. I feel like I am dead inside and I am so alone and the whole world is passing me by. I can not concentrate and my memory is bad I feel so dumb and I feel like I am caught in two worlds at once. I just cry all the time and think about death
