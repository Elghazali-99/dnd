I am step mom to a 5 year old girl. I have been taking care of her since she was 6 months old. Her mother has been in and out of her life since she was little. Her mom has not called or tired to come see her in 5 months. My step daughter   has been acting out alot. She used to be a polite little girl she used to say thank you, please, and be nice to other kids. But the past 5 months have gotten really bad. I had a baby 9 months ago and im having problems trying to lose the weight she will come up to me and call me a fat b****. She will say i hate. She has even slapped me in my face a couple of times. I just dont know what to do anymore. She is in preschool and i have talked to the teachers and they have said she talks about how much she loves me and misses me and can not wait till school gets out so she can come home and spend time with me. She has hit her little sitter and has bitten my little sitter who is 7. We used to be so close. Any one have advice on what i can do.
