I was given Celexa 8 months after my daughter was born for postpartum depression. 16 years later I am trying once again to come off it. I have seen my doctor who suggested a week in between dropping my dose but I asked for 2 weeks to make it more gradual. I've been off it for 3 weeks now. I went through a lot of physical symptoms - buzzing in my ears, dizziness, some nausea but those are subsiding. What isn't subsiding are the days where I feel quite depressed. I have an appointment to see my doctor in 10 days but am not sure I can wait that long before taking the initiative myself to go back on it. My husband and daughter are as understanding as possible but it's not been pleasant for them. Some days I just want to crawl up into a ball and disappear. My tears are just below the surface waiting for something to be set off. About 5 years ago I tried to come off Celexa at an even slower pace. After two weeks being off of it I couldn't stand being around myself as I was (pardon me) such a "*****". I was cranky, unpleasant and argumentative. I haven't experienced that to the same degree this time. My question is: Because I'm feeling depressed, is it that the depression never left me or am I still experiencing withdrawal symptoms?
