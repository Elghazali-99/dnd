SOCIAL ABUSE,PHYSICAL ABUSE,VERBAL ABUSE,EMOTIONAL ABUSE(all in one questions) All of my life I have people abuse me to the point were I am totally petrified of people now.My question is I want to to have friends socialize with people but how do get over this many many years of abuse with people that I've had to be enforced to deal with all of my life?I'm forty-one years old now and lonely.And everytime I hear that someone wants to get to know me socially I get so scared that litterally throw up with fear.I lack social skills REALLY bad.I go to chat with my neighbors and within a matter of a few days to a week they try to avoid me like the pleague.I don't dare to ask them why because I know the truth will never be told.I see a therapist we've had our share of problems and last week we were talking about some issues that I was doing at my place of conseling that took up our time.Well I am extemely over waite and I was mentioning that I would love to meet the son of one of neighbors if was not so over wait.My therapist had a look on its face as  if to say I agree to that.I didn't have time to bring it on up and I am going to on therapist's voicemail.I am REALLY angry with the therapist for doing that.Here I am with a very low self esteem and very subconscious of my looks and therapists dose this to me.So unfair so crewel so rotten to do especially with my bad past.I have been dealing with a wait issue for years.I am not going to let therapist weave its way out of this.No,not by along shot.,It hurt me its now made me more fearful of people and to even go in public now is a definite no no.My therapist is suppose to be helping not emotionally or psychologically abusing people like me especially someone with my kind of history background.And now I am more with drawn and  stay inside person now.I never go out now thanks to therapist.I have cried over this issue now and therapist has in just those few minutes have successfully reopened now every abuse wound that I have fought all of my life to heal and close.I came to therapist for help not for this kind treatment from therapist.Any there any way I can file a complaint against my therapist?
