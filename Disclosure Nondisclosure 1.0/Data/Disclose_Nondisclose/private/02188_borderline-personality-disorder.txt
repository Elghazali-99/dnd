I am have a Shame Disorder.  I have been hiding behind it my whole life.  I have not tried to really help myself other then going to my primary doctor and getting on meds.  I had a long talk to my doctor yesterday and we both came to a conclusion that its time i go to therapy.  He gave me a real sense of hope.  He told me that there is hope to be found, but i have to be willing to try and help myself by allowing myself therapy.  So i am going.  I hope those out there realize that they can to have help and be healthy if they just make that first step and go seek help.  Even if its just your primiary doctor.  Sit down with him or her and let them know what you are feeling and from there your doctor will help you find the best course of action that is best for you.  He or she will remind you, YES, there is hope for your happiness and YES you deserve to be happy!  Good luck to you all and please seek help.  God loves you or he wouldn't have taken the time to create you.  He created you cause you deserve life and happiness so take the first step, and everything else will come in time.
