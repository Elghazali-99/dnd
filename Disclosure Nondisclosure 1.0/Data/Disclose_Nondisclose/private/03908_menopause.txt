I don't know that this is really a question but has anyone had problems with symptoms that seem like low blood pressure - suddenly feeling faint and weak and having to lay down before you pass out?  Not really passing out but not having enough energy to even sit.  I've only had this happen twice but it has really freaked me out - needless to say it's driving my anxiety through the roof and now my jitters are full blown again (after I thought they were at least somewhat under control).  All of this s---s!  Once upon a time I was a competent, self reliant human being- now I feel worthless, hopeless and depressed that this may be all there is from now on.  I can't do any "real" strenuous work without my heart pounding (yes, I'm trying to get in to see a cardiologist but that can't happen until at least next week - ugh).  I feel like I've had the "perfect storm" but I'm sinking instead of coming out the other side.  I'm 53 (menopausal - thank heaven for no periods at least, for 4 months anyway!), my Mom died almost 3 years ago after a year or so in Parkinson's hell, a year before that I was informed (yet again) that apparently I'm not desirable to males of the species, and this hormonal rollercoaster is in full swing (stop the ride, I want to get off!).  I have always been terrified of doctors and the ones I've been to lately have just been pill pushers ("take hrt, or take antidepressants or I don't have anything else to offer").  I don't have the "support community" that everyone says we need - have never been good at making friends, too introverted I guess and I'm afraid I'm driving the few friends I do have away by being so miserable.  Wondering how I'm going to keep doing my job etc etc -  Living with my 90+ year old father  - he's easy, thankfully, but that doesn't lessen the worry.  I don't know what to do - I'm getting tired of one step in front of the other when it never feels like I'm going anywhere.  Can anyone give me hope?
