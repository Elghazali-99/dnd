Been married almost 20 years with 3 kids -- elementary to high school.
 My husband is mostly supportive and provides well and is a good dad.
 He has a bit of a temper but usually cools down fairly quickly.  We have one issue that comes up sometimes and just becomes unbearable.  Before we met I had a boyfriend for about 2.5-3 years and we slept together.  My husband knew this and we dated for 4 years before we got married.  But every so often he gets really angry about this and makes me feel like an absolute horrible person.  The biggest lowlife in the world and says it was a mistake that he married me.
 I love(d) him but I just don't know how much more of this I can take.  The first years there was no talk like this but since growing our family he just gets on this every so often and it will be weeks of misery.  I guess I've probably stayed because it always got better and we had a family and I wanted to stay together and didn't want to hurt our kids.
 Tmes have been tough and I don't know if I could financially swing to leave and take care of my kids.  He is spiteful to others who have done him "wrong" so I am a bit afraid he would torture me at the expense of the kids.  I do not have family to speak of, so I don't have support in that regard.
 Most importantly I don't know what would be more detrimental to my kids.  They are mostly shielded from this (they see dad being angry at me but don't know why) so do I just try to get through the rough patches or is the writing on the wall?
 I do have regret but I also don't think I am deserving of the attacks I am receiving.  I know he had several "partners" before me.  I haven't ever asked for details nor have I wanted them.  I just accepted that it was before me and had nothing to do with me.
 Any opinions would be helpful.
