I have been experiencing mental problems that include mispelling words or using the wrong version of the word when I'm either writing or typing (which is a huge deal because I have always done well with the english language). For example, I'll be wanting to type "I need to get this restored" but it will come out as "I need to get this restoratation." I feel that I'm also struggling to organize thoughts and ideas when it comes down to my job as an office administrator.  
 This has been concerning me for quite some time because it is affecting my job and my ability to do it well.  I used to do so well at being organized and at communicating with others.  
 I wonder if the stress I've experienced in the last few years to do with my marriage (we were on the verge of divorce) has anything to do with it.  During that time I was diagnosed with depression and I was on anti-depressants for 6 months.  
 Is my brain not working properly?  or is all of this just really all in my head and I need to get over it?
