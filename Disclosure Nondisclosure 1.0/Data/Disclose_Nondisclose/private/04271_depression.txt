Over the last couple of years ive noticed my personality, passions and just my whole life being just doesnt excist anymore.. there are some days i wont leave my room.. and ill lie to friends and family about having things to do just so they dont ask me to do anything.. sounds mean but i just dont have the urge to do things anymore.. i use to paint i mean paint everyday i always had ideas and things in my head.. for the last couple of years its just not there and i cant get excited about anything i mean anything ive messed up the last two relationships with two good guys  because they felt that i was emotionless.. and im really starting to think i am.. i get the urge to cry at the most random crap but when the person i love is leaving i wont shed a tear..I guess my question is whats wrong with me.. where has my passion for life and just general excitment for new days and new adventure gone? I want to be the person i use to be the fun down for whatever person who found excitement in everything and had the imagination to paint the world... But at this moment in life i just dont know what to do anymore and how to get it back..
