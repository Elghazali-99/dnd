I am 58 on SS disability and hae been arried fo 22 1/2 years.  My husband rages at me, threatens me, yells at me, calls me filthy names and drinks 4 or more mixed drinks a night. After he drinks he starts his rages. He tells me I have to sit down, shut up and take a sleeping pill.  I have multiple sclerosis and 5 other auto-immune diseases and just went to ER again and have pleurisy.  He has a restraining order but that didn't work.  Copes called here to help me and they aren't nd haven't been filing any reports on my calls for help.  He now has a second restraining order on 9/9/09 and nothing stops. He left me with $1.08- 3 months behind on house payments, 2 months behind on truck payments, utility bills behind 2 months, auto insurance behind and about to be canceled and last night his sister said he borrowed money ffrom him for his attorney for court and I don't know what else and she was puttng lein on my truck. He now has both vehicles, our boat and he wants the house. He will take it or the bank will.  I am so far down I just can't see any daylight.  I can walk all the way to town and have no idea where to turn.  Cops just leave him here with me for years now and he just has always kept abusing me.  Waits til I take my sleeping pill and has sex with me and I don't know about until the next morning when I am bleeding.  He just laughs and says he Hopes it was as good for me as it was for him.  I am trying so hard to stay healthy and win oer the MS but between all he collectors calling and all of his abuse and his family abuse-I am sinking so low.  I just want to smile again.  I need some help. Now i have no transportation or money-I feel like I am in a jail cell.  Who helps someone like me?  Thanks for letting me talk.
