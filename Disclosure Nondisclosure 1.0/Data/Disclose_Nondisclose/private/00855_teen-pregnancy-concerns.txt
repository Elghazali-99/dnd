Back in December, about the 5th, I met back up with my long-term ex boyfriend of three years and we slept together. At the time we were discussing getting back together and ended up sleeping together. He used a condom. He did not mention the condom breaking or anything. I would like to believe he would because it's happened and I have taken the Plan B in the past.
 My periods have usually been about 5-6 days. However my past two have been only two-four days and incredibly light. I blamed the second one being light due to starting a 90 day fitness challange on New Years as part of my resolution to lift more and get in better shape. I've been doing my calories, changing my diet, only eating CLEAN and am GAINING weight. My mom says I'm insane but I feel it looks like I'm really bloated. The weight gain hasn't been much but about five/six pounds. There's no way that eating 1500 calories and working out 6-7 days a week this can be possible. Especially when some days I'm doing 45-90 minutes of HIIT.
 I've also noticed I've been urinating more often but again am associating that with drinking more water however I am beginning to become increasingly concerned. I'm eighteen and daughter to a single mother. We can't even afford rent most months and I haven't spoken to my ex since the middle of January when we got into a pretty bad fight. Should I be concerned or am I over-analyzing everything? Help is much wanted.
