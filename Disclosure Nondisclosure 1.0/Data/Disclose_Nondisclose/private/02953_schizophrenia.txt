So recently I've been feeling a little strange so i spoke to my mum and she suggested that i may have Schizophrenia. Basically the past few days, whilst sitting alone in my bedroom, i heard a voice. And the only way to describe it is, when your sitting with someone and you feel like you have something to tell them and you can feel the thought at the back of your mind, it felt exactly like that,  but i could hear it. It was muffled and i couldn't understand it but it was a very enraged voice and i found myself feeling angry, and like i needed to scream out whatever it was that was at the back of my mind. This happened to me twice and then one morning when i woke up, it wasn't a sentence but just felt like an enrage "AHH" at the back of my mind and i also felt then like i needed to scream it out loud.  Also because of obvious reasons i have looked into Schizophrenia online and i have a few other early symptoms like 'Oversleeping or insomnia', 'Inappropriate laughter or crying', 'Deterioration of personal hygiene', 'Forgetful; unable to concentrate'. And just because this may be appropriate and help my question be answered, i used to self harm, and lately have thought about doing it again, also ever since i started self harming and even after i stopped i have always thought about suicide, not actually carrying it out, but they ways to do and how everyone would feel and then they may care about me, that sort of thing. I'd be really great full if someone can give me some opinions or suggestions. Thank you.
