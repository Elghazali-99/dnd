Has anyone here gone from being totally stuck to being in a position of feeling in control of their life?
 I feel stuck and feel powerless to do anything about it.  Before I most likely would have hurt myself but now that doesn't even seem like an option and adds to my sense of feeling trapped.  I feel so tired and frustrated.  The crazy thing about all this is that I can't even access support and even if it were there I doubt I would be able to use it.  Just feel so angry, hurt and frustrated by everything.
 I feel like I am merely existing.  Even then it feels like a great part of my week is dedicated to just surviving.
I discussed safety issues with my doctor and it seems so important that there hasn't even been any contact.  This makes me feel angry and frustrated.  It seems that there is no acknowledgement that things are so difficult.  I am also finding this a little triggering as I feel that nobody is listening or that nobody cares (or cares enough).  My doctor said that he is doing his best to access support for me.  After two and a half years without support it makes me question if it is his best and if it is, what then?  What does that say about either him or I?  Maybe his best at helping helps his ego.  It must be nice at times to feel needed (even if it is only by someone with bpd).
