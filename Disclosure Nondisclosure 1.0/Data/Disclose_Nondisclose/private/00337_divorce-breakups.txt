i just feel like i cant control myself. i know i love my boyfriend but i feel so out of reach when it comes to emotion, all i do is cry instead of stand up for myself and look for people to feel bad and give me attention. instead of having confidence and making people come to me i throw myself at them and im judged way too quickly. i want to change all that because deep down i know i can be a perfect girlfriend and not some dirty tramp who throws herself around for attention because she lacks self confidence. my self pity takes over and instead of remembering i have someone who loves me i become selfish and im hurting the people around me. my boyfriend thinks i can just learn to control this and get over it, but i feel like theres something so much bigger and deeper than either one of us can do alone, i need to talk to people who know that deep feeling, the feeling that ont go away no matter how much you want it to because i believe in the long run, it will open his eyes to the fact that im not doing this to hurt him and that there is something so much bigger. . I need to change and i think i found a way to start.
 much love
