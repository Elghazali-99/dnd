Does anyone have this similar dynamic with their father?
 My dad was inappropriate with me when a teenager, not touching....but leering...comments, wanting to be with me alone, etc........now that Im an adult and live in same city.......it's the same but I thought it would be different.
 I have been here two years, and when I first moved here, he continued to make me VERY uncomfortable and always wanting to be with me alone, and sending my extremely sexual emails, and still does.  He is married now but they arent close. I cant wrap my head around why my father, now that he KNOWS I dont view him in a sexual way..(gross) now makes innuendos about how OLD I am and calls me "Klutz" retarded etc and seems angry that he knows I have NO interest. He acts like a "spurned" ex.
 Has anyone had this in their life and how can I cut all ties? My health is suffering because of it, and I dont enjoy our occasional "coffee dates" and have limited them to every so often, but I feel sick when Im around him.
 Am I the only female with this weird father?
