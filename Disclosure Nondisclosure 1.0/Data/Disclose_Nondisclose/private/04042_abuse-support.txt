I never thought I would have to be posting something like this.  First of all, I have 2 children, a 13 year old son and a 3 year old daughter.  My ex husband and I divorced when my son was 9, and he spends every other weekend with his father.  He lives primarily with me, my daughter and my boyfriend (who has been with us since the divorce.)   My ex husband and his wife just dropped my son off after his weekend and informed me that my son has been going into his 13 year old step sisters room and touching her while he is sleeping.  Apparently this has happened 3 or 4 times before.  She claims that he has poked at her breasts and grabbed her butt.  He claims that he was "dreaming" and does not remember any of this.  I am horrified and at a total loss as to what to do.  He does not sleep walk.  I'm sure that he did this.  He is going through puberty and spends a lot of time alone in his room, so I know that he is exploring his sexuality, but this is crossing the line!  I know that he has never been abused or anything, so why is this happening?????  What am I supposed to do?  I immediately think I should get him counseling but I don't want to make him feel like there is something wrong with him.  My husbands wife says that I should watch my son around my daughter which made me a bit mad.  I know my child!!!  But this is just too much.  What do I do?
