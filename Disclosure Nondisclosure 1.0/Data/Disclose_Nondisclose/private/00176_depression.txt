I was just prescribed Zolft for anxiety and my doctor started me on the low dose of 50mg but said I could start off with 25mg the first few days to hopefully lessen side effects because he had originally prescribed me Citalopram but after the first dose the side effects were so bad I could barely function. Anyway, I took my first dose of Zoloft last night after dinner and aside from feeling a little queasy and fuzzy in the head it wasn't too bad but then I had a horrible night. I couldn't sleep well, I tossed and turned and felt nauseous all night. Today I feel pretty horrible. I still feel nauseous and I can't eat. I have a horrible headache and my head feels so cloudy. It makes me not want to take it anymore but I know I need help. Has anyone else had this experience with Zoloft and how long did it take for it to go away? I work full-time as a bank teller and i have an extremely hard time working when I feel like this but I can't take off. Any advice or words on encouragement?
