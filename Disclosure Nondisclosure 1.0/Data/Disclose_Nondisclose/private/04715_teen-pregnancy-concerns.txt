Im 15 years old and I've never used any form of hormonal birth control prior to what im taking now (microgestin fe 1/20.) I started the pill on the first day of my period which was a Thursday. 
 My gynecologist told me that I must take a whole pack of pills(so three weeks worth, I have the 21 day packs) before I am protected against pregnancy. But I have also heard that as long as you start on the 1st day of period, which I did, that you are protected right away. Another thing that I have heard is that it takes 7 days. Im aware I should listen to what the professional told me rather than consult the Internet but im just really confused. 
 I had unprotected sex after being on the pill for nearly two weeks (11 days.) After the sex, I immediately went to the bathroom and urinated and noticed a lot of clear thicker liquid slowly coming out of me. I thought maybe it was my own fluids but this had never happened any of the other times I had sex. So does this mean my partner came inside me? If so, have I been on birth control long enough to be protected against pregnancy? 
 Im going to the gynecologist next to be tested for STDs, should I ask them to test me for pregnancy as well or would they disregard my  fear since i am on birth control
