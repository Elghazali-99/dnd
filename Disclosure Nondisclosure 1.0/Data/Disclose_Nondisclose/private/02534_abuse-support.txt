Hi. My friend`s boyfriend pushed her on the floor from the bench yesterday when he was drunk, after she told him she was slowly dancing w/her ex boyfriend and they bodies were so close(she lied to see what he will do). 
 They are together few months and she hit him few times, they bite each other, but that`s their game and way of joking. Nut yesterday he was furious. And today he apologies all the time, and blaming her that see musn`t make him mad and stuff. That are typical sings of violent behavior.  
 Both of them are also very jealous, passionate and impulsive. And they argue every week few times. 
 She is not ready to dump him because he is the first guy who she really loves, and she had a lot, I mean: REALLY LOT of them. I won`t pressure her to leave him. I want her to talk to me because I know how much easy can she become convinced she`s wrong, so I have to be her dose of reality. 
 I said to her she must fight for her rights, and tell him that this is a second and last opportunity 4 their relationship. If he repeats his behavior, she will dump him. She is so good looking and almost every guy likes her a lot... And he knows that.
 I also said she must try to explain him he has got a problem. And that she is scared of what he might do. And that he cannot response on her words by physical actions. It`s just not right. 
 How can she help him except the problem before it`s too late? Can she show him typical stories of abusing? Maybe he will realize then. But now he is in faze of denial. I don`t know how to help them...
