hi, i have been trying to control my anger since 3-4years. i tried to do meditation for some time. i used breathing technique and so on. but i am unable to control my anger. my mom always keeps talking ill about others. i have asked here not to do so, but she does that everyday. for each and everything she screams, shouts, talks ill about others(neighbours, mother-in-law, her sister, servants and so on). day by day am getting crazy. i hate to shout at her but she forces me to do that(just to stop her). i lose my patience in the end. by the end of the day i won't be in a good mood, unable to concentrate on my work. my dad he hardly gets time to be at home. whole day he will be busy in his office. even during holidays. he goes to his office at 8 in the morning; comes back home at 3 in d afternoon for lunch; again leaves at 4 and returns back home at 10. after that he goes to sleep. we don't even have a good doctor who can solve my problem. is there anything you can do? to help me?
