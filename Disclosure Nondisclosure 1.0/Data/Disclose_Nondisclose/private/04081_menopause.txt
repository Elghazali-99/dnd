Hi, I'm 49 and in total SHOCK! I stopped having my period a year and a half ago (at 47) and about 3 weeks ago I had a small drops of blood stain my undies, but didnt pay much attention to it.
 Well just a few days ago, on April 20th, I felt in my body as if I would have my "period once again", so I placed a pad on and, SURE ENOUGH, there was the discharge a few hrs later.
 Just to be clear on my Monopause, During the total absence of my regular 28-day cycle Periods I used to have until age 47, I did have Hot flashes for a short period of time, approximately a couple of months, then no more. During this 1.5 yrs I had absolutely CERO discharges of blood (periods).
 For my last 6 months prior to my "menopause", I began to be missing or having irregularities in my periods, until they just completely stopped.
But on April 20th, 2017, I had what I would call a "regular period" once again, with 3 days of discharge and even some cramps, after the 3 days the bleeding completely stopped.
So my question: Is it humanly possible for a woman that has gone into Menopause to get her Period Cycles once again?, how rare is this among women?
 Thanks MUCH in advance for your input!
