I am scheduled for a sedated uterine biopsy in the OR on July 28th.  I am 55 years-old and except for a fibroid, obesity and elevated triglycerides, am blessedly healthy.  In June I had extremely heavy postmenopausal menstruation.  Feeling exhausted and foggy headed, I asked for an immediate appt with my OB/GYN.  My BP was 74/59 and pulse 151.  He attempted a biopsy with several different instruments without success.  Very painful.  I was sent to the ER where they performed a pelvic and inter-vaginal ultrasound.  My fibroid,14 cm in 2008, had shrunk to 12 cm.  The ER OB/GYN tried obsessively to get a biopsy without success.  Very painful.  I was admitted overnight and received 3 units of blood.  Two weeks later, I took Cytotec to relax my cervix and my OB/GYN tried again, diligently, to get a biopsy without success.  Very painful.
 Which brings us to the pending fourth attempt.  I have no experience with pain medication beyond the occasional Advil.  What medications would be most helpful before, during and after?  At this point my anxiety/stress is very high.  I consider each of the first three efforts torture without malicious intent.  It would help me immensely to know the pain will be controlled this fourth time.  My pre-op meeting is next week.  What pain management options should I discuss with my doctor?
