Hi there,
 I am in pre menopause and entering menopause.  My periods have been irregular for the past while.  I am 55 years old and I have had three children.  My weight is good and am a non smoker.  I have gone for a pap test yearly since I was 19 and even had a cone biopsy and d&c three years ago due to spotting, but this can back clear.
 Went for an ultrasound due to cysts that cleared up.  But the last ultrasound showed a thickened lining.  So off to the gyn I head for a biopsy that came back with "complex hyperplasia" No cancer or pre cancer showing.
 So I am scheduled now for a hysterectomy as the Gyn stated I am 55 and I do not need to have these organs any longer.  He said he is doing this as a preventive against me developing cancer later.
 I am not knowing what to do...is a hystercomy really necessary. 
 My question is this...it is just possible that my lining is just thick due to the fact that I am not releasing eggs monthly and the lining is just sitting there waiting for this?  How common is a thick uterus in a woman that is entering menopause?
 Any advise would be greatly appreciated.
