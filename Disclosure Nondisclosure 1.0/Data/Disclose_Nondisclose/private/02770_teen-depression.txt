I am 13 and am pretty sure I am depressed. I have been feeling down for a few months now. I am always tired and never want to do my homework. I have gotten really close to hurting myself a few times now and am really scared of what I might do to myself. I cry all the time and once I broke down in the bathroom and almost threw up. I have gotten so close to cutting that I have held a knife to my skin, and I constantly put myself down. I tell myself i'm ugly and that no one will ever love me. I am made fun of by friends sometimes. They call me a loser and that I am fat even though I am only 100lb. They say they are only joking around but it really hurts. I have tried to talk to them about how I dont like when they call me names but they say they are only playing and that I am such a wimp. I dont know what to do. I can't talk to my parents about this, they think I am the "perfect child" or somthing. They would just say it's Hormones and that it's natural and just think happy thoughts. But I know it's more than that. And as you can see, my "friends" are not an option. I took an online depression test and it said that I am depressed. I am just really scared and don't know where to go. Please help me.
