Hello everyone,
For the past 10 years or so I have been living with pretty severe anxiety that has only gotten worse. When I started my new job, which is extremly stressful I noticed alot of my emotions both good and bad are numbed out. I have tried several meds for my anxiety including buspar, klonopin, and xanax. Buspar helped my mental anxiety a little, but wasn't enough. Klonopin and xanax both work, but do nothing for my mood really which I was hoping was mostly anxiety related. I don't the typical sadness or feeling down like you do with depression, but rather the apathetic and low energy depression, but also really bad anxiety. I have tried Wellbutrin and Lexparo about 10 years ago. Wellbutrin worked great for my depression, but also increased the anxiety. Lexapro seemed to do nothing for my mood other than completely numbing my emotions and killing my sex drive. I have avoided going back on meds, but I really feel like it's time to do something. I know benzos are supposed to be long term, but am wondering if something like Wellbutrin and Klonopin may be my best bet. Besides SSRIs and benzos there really isn't much else to try. I was looking into Remeron, but am concerned with the weight gain. I know everyone reacts different to meds, but any input would be appreciated. The main side effects I am looking to avoid is low libido, emotional numbing as I already have that, and weight gain.
