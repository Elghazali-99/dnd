I have been having extreme mood swings.  I can go from feeling fine, not really happy, but just fine to extreme rage/anger and disgust with life in general.  It gets to the point where I just want to go home and lock myself in, not speak to anyone and just watch TV all day.  I can't concentrate on anything I'm doing at work.  I guess what has pissed me off today is my husband - he is so selfish.  We have been having financial difficulties and he lost his job a couple of weeks ago.  Well, I got my employer to hire him part-time at night so we don't have to put our kids in daycare (he can watch them in the daytime and me at night).  I thought that was a very generous thing for my employer to do.  Well, now my husband is talking about joining some dumb-ass kung fu group 2 nights a week and missing those hours of work and spending $75 a month on it.  Well, he already spends money on a gym membership and supplements for his various workouts, but now he wants to do this, too?  I have to wear raggedy WINTER clothes in the heat because I am still fat from having a baby and we can't even buy me any decent clothes to wear to work and I can't fit my pre-baby clothes yet.  I am just so sick of this.  I am about to tell him to just stay home and do his various little projects, workouts, etc. and I will just be the breadwinner - just don't hinder me!  I will have to get a weekend job but he ******* when I even mention it.  I am so sick of life.
