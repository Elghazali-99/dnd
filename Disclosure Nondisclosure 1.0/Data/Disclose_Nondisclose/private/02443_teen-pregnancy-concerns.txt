ok so i have irregular periods the shortest is 35 the longest is 51 and counting....so 6 weeks ago i had sex with someone ..without my concent because it seems that i was drugged....and it was my 1st time......i remember that he use condom but before he could come i was save by my friends....so no ejaculation i tried to forget about it but i felt weird lately
 i don't know what to do... i'm having some clear white and watery discharge and felt nauseous without vomiting 3 weeks ago,then 5 days ago i started having cramps and last night my breast felt tender....... I'm scared to buy a test or to go to an Ob Gyn..since this is a first ... and i'm still 17 ..i regret this ..i should not have go to that place but peer pressure...I'm afraid to tell my parents..i felt dirty and shameful... please help me... my period is late by 4 days already but I'm not sure what to do....i don't know if its late because of stress and other things except pregnancy ..
i don't know if a felt nauseous every time i wake up because i'm hungry or because of lack of sleep just not pregnancy ..i don't know if i the tender breast , white discharge and cramps was because my period is coming or because ...i..i'm pregnant....please tell me what do you thik is going on in me...
