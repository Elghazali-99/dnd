I'm a 23 yr male 5"11, 170lbs. I don't smoke, drink, or do drugs. Generally I eat health but I should exercise more often. I have lived this lifestyle for many years with no problem.
 Recently however 3 weeks ago I developed a more acute "shortness of breath" , "lack of sufficient oxygen", and generally unable to catch enough air even when I am sitting/lying down and even when I am trying to do deep slow breathing. This has lasted to this day, but I have NOT gotten a fever, I do not have the flu or some virus infection nor do I cough up blood or lots of mucus, etc.. I don't have swollen ankles or wrists and no wheezing that would be indicative of asthma. It FEELS like lack of air along WITH "lung pain" or like somehow my lung has gone bad or it has been "beat up" or "kicked around". There is a weird sensation, sour-ness to it but I'm not sure it is heartburn bc I've never had heartburn before. I have never had this kind of chronic breathing problems before. My pulse is around 65-70, my blood pressure is ~ 70-125, so I am within range. Should I purchase an oxymeter and make sure I can getting enough Oxygen in my bloodstream doing these period periods of what I can only describe as "breathing attacks"?? And if the oxygen level is normal what would explain my "lack of air" and "difficulty breathing"?? I mean I can physically breathe in and out the same volume of air and there is no wheezing or ariticial blockadge or restriction but my body feels like it is NOT getting enough oxygen during these times and I get a slight light headed dizziness and it is almost like I can consistently out of breathe even when I am resting and lying down and not stressed out and doing my best to breathe correctly....
 Does anyone know what could be my problem? Thanks
