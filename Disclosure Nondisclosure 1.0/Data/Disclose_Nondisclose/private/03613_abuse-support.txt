I was abused by my step father from 14 to 18 years old.  I was told a lot of lies and, as a result, didn't see or speak to my real dad for three years after my parents divorce (when I was 14).
I have always felt my mom didnt like me and I was a burden.  I had nowhere to go.
 I am now 36, married, have three sons, and I only told hubby about the abuse last year.  
 Recently it came to my attention that family friends whom we knew for 40 years stopped talking to all of us because last year step dad did something inappropriate while treating the friends daughter ( in her 30's and 8 months pregnant).  When I found out my mom starting yelling at me that I had to support him and I krpt saying I could not and eventually said goodbye and hung up.  Hubby and I decided it was time to tell mom.  I couldn't do it, so he did.  She had my aunt with her.
 I have since told my dad and step mom, reconnected with my old friend, but have totally lost my mom and brother and that entire side ofnmy family (aunt, grandmother,  cousins).
 My brother is getting married in two months, my youngest is supposed to be in the wedding.  I no longer want to go (mother,  abuser, people who don't believe).
 I also need to figure out how to tell my sons (3, 9, 12) that these people are no longer a part of our lives ( the grandparents spoiled them).  Please help!!
