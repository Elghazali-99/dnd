Hi i hope i could get an answer here. Im worried that I am pregnant and im still 16 and clearly i am not ready for that. But the thing is, nothing happened. No penetration involved. But my bf said he felt his penis just touched my as*hole. Just touch. No precum or ejacuation involved. Its the fifth week since the "thing" happened (if you can even consider that as a thing) because im being honest here, nothing really happened. Just touch. But last week i told him i felt the "nausea" thing only when i get nervous and scared when the thought of me being pregnant passes my mind. And i think that my period is delayed. And i feel like my stomach grew a little. I searched online and it says that worrying about you being pregnant can really delay or skip your period. is this true? is this what's happening to me? I never felt any other pregnancy symptoms. My breast did not enlarge and i dont feel fatigued. No headaches. No morning sickness. Im planning to take a pregnancy test. Should i do that? Am i pregnant? please help me....
