I am 16 and I think I was depressed since 14. Anyway, I dated someone for two years. We broke up in September. Once I realized he was really gone (new years day) my heart was broken. He was like the only friend I had..my best friend and someone who complimented me when I was down. And he was a really nice boyfriend, but also kind of sensitive. He would cry if he felt like he didn't live up to my expectations. Needless to say, I never thought he would be the one to break my heart. Now he has a new girlfriend and they've gone to Panama together while only dating for a month. We've never been on a date like that and Idk whose parents would allow that...I wouldn't even think his parents would but I guess that doesn't matter.
  The breakup really took a toll on me. I feel very lonely. My self esteem is low. the worst part is that I still don't have a boyfriend. No guys seem interested in me. The weird part is that I felt alone and insecure when I was with my ex, so I cant really say my problems come from that. They really escalated tho. Basically, I want to know if theres anyone out there that's been in a similar situation? How did you get through ongoing problems of insecurity, loneliness, depression, and a breakup with someone that's having none of those problems. His life seems better without me in it. I hate high school.
