I have been talking with my psychiatrist about what some of the causes of the dissociation I have might be and they have at one timed mentioned PTSD as a potential (the specific traumatic event being 2 near death experiences from my physical disability before it was treated by a neurologist). I know also that the dissociation tends to flare up at times that remind me of this, especially the times when I am physically homebound and the days I am out and about (with people assisting me) things are better. I know some of this is psychological as well. I can discuss the specifics more of my own experience with my psychiatrist but I'd appreciate if anyone who has both PTSD and schizoaffective (or schizophrenia) could tell me how your psychiatrist explained the difference and how you can tell the two apart and a little bit more about what the experience of having PTSD is like. I know there is a forum for that but I am trying to understand what its like for someone who is dually diagnosed. Thanks.
