My Psychologist thinks I have severe depression and borderline personality disorder. Lately, I've been waking up in the middle of the night and I'll falll back asleep but I wake up in the middle of the night. I'm eating a lot more food. I have no energy and no motivation to do anything. I constantly think negative things about myself and view myself as a loser. I always twitch my hands when I'm sitting down and I'm getting some big confusion when I talk, I Feel like its hard to maintain a conversation sometimes, and I have problems remembering things. Things dont feel the same as they used to. I'll look out the window on a beautiful warm nice sunny day and i used to say to myself, " Look at God's beautiful creation," and now it feels like everyday is a cloudy gray long day. I have no interest in anything anymore, not even girls. My psychologist wants to put me on Prozac for Depression and Xanax for my panic attacks. I also hasve occasional periods where i think about my break up with the girl I loved several years ago, and I cry and I feel numb like I cannot feel anything anymore.  I feel disconnected from my body and like my soul is dead or taken over or I just changed and I'll never be the same as I used to be and its so scary it makes me wanna go into a room and cry but then its hard to cry bc i feel so numb i cant feel anything anymore.  please help me guys i feel disconnected from my own body, numb, and like i cant feel any feeling and its so scary.
