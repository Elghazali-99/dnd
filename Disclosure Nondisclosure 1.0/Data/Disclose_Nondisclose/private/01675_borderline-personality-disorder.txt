Mommie of two. Over whelmingly taken over by my BPD. Want to be the best mom to my babies that i can, and i find that my disorder ruins my abitility to do so. I am under full treatment and still find that i have trouble coping. I am on ALOT of meds...and have tried ever ... [More] ything under the sun and still find little to no relief of my symptoms. I am starting to feel hopeless and like this is just my life. I have ADHD as well and am perscribed meds for that as well, but intentionally i misuse them because i feel it makes me a better me all around. i cannot contiue this way. i feel alone in this, and am starting to believe that if life continues for me in this manner that in the end i will not make it. I am great at putting on a show and making everyone think i am ok.....or even better than ok, when really i am so broken and hurting on the inside. i want to LIVE life. I want to be happy, really sincerelly happy, content in life, a mother my children can be proud of....but instead, i despair, because all i will ever be is me
