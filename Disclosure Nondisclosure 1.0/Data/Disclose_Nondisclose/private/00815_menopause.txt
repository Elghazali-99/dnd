so glad I found this site. my journey began in 2010 when I started having very heavy periods this went on for over a year when I went to my family dr. he asked me if I was anemic I told him I didn't think so but was very tired. he checked my blood and found that I was. had to have other testing done to roll out other issues. after that I was sent to my ob-gyn which did a biopy which was ok then put me on depo shots for two years to get me to menopause. sorry I didn't mention my heavy bleeding was coming from fibroids. got off the shots and was doing ok until janurary of this year 2014 then I started hit and skipping my periods. have one next month none that went on until may had a 7day period then in june it hit I started what was a 23 day period very heavy at times stoped for 5 days then started again. went back to my ob-gyn who told me it was menopause. hormone imbalance put me on prempro I am still bleeding not as heavy been taking it for almost a month he told me it could take up to 3 months to even out in the mean time I think im going crazy cry one minute ok the next along with other issues. someone please help me before I go crazy. and drive the people around me crazy too. Thanks.
