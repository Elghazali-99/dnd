i feel like I've been suffering for 100years not 21..how can time move so damn slowly yet months and years seem to have jumped past. i feel like me head is a tangled mess, threaded with fear, anxiety, stress, loneliness and confused all rolled up in a ball over self harm and suicide. my head feels like its going to explode with the pain and the constant feel of sickness all the while trying to function in day to day life-going to work, driving my car and worrying about keeping my boyfriend satisfied when all i want to do it scream and scream and then maybe i wont feel invisible anymore, maybe i actually feel like I'm noticed. I'm tired of not fitting in, I'm tired with living with my mistakes and I'm tired that the whole damn idea of life is so stupid, i hate it, i hate me and i hate the stupid people around me. I'm going crazy and just to top the whole thing off my therapist of 5yrs who i have trusted my whole life with is leaving and suicide plans seem to have more and more holes appearing making me more and more anxious that suicide take 2 will fail. i just cant even take the thought that it could fail because then i will really be f*cked.
