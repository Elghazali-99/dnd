im not entirely sure whats going on with me atm but everyone around me seems to think im suffering from anxiety... i cant quite say whether it is that or not.... i have felt so distant from myself for about 5 months now, ive had this feeling before but this time its just not going away, i want to push everyone close to me away yet i dont wanna be alone?! i cry, alot! and basically just feel like im totally losing grip of myself, i was always the fun outgoing kinda person so i try to put tht on when my friends are around but i miss being normal, whatever normal is! also tryna hold down a job, ive now walked out of two jobs since june something which i would never have seen myself doing, i just wanna know if this is anxiety or is it some sort of depression i need help but feel embarrased to tlk to anyone about it and feel theyll all eventually get bored of seeing me walking around with a sad soppy face! ive also not had a proper nights sleep in about three years, i cannot sleep at night at all i cant explain why, so i sit awake until 7/8AM and alot of the time i dont sleep for well over 24 hours, ive tried sleeping meds nothing helps could this be a big factor to the way im feeling also
