Hi. I have had depression ever since I can remember, although my parents refused to admit it and get me help until years later when it got out of control. There is SO much to this story, but ill try to sum it up. Basically, I quit taking my meds about 8 months ago due to the fact that I didn't feel they were helping enough anyway and I got sick of the fact that I had to take them just to try and live a normal life. I started smoking pot every day because it seemed to be the only thing that helped. It even made me quit cutting which I have been addicted to for 5 years. Well now I am pregnant so I quit smoking about a month ago for my child's sake. And the depression is coming back. I know its my hormones all out of whack due to the pregnancy that aren't helping, but I am to the point again where I feel like cutting and I just want to die. Don't get me wrong, I don't plan to do anything that could harm my child. But I've lost all my friends and my boyfriend (the father) isn't very supportive. I'm just wondering if anyone would be willing to talk openly about things and I'd be willing to listen as well if they need to talk about anything. It's hard to cope with the stress especially when you have no one to turn to. Any help would be appreciated.. thanks.
