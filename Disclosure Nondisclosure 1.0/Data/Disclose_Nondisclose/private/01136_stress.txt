I think I suffer from GAD. But havnt been diagnosed with it. I get these spells... I get paranoid for some reason, my legs start shaking.. my arms.. and I get into this downward spiral of FEAR.  And I don't know why I feel like this. My life isnt that stressful. I'm only 24 years old.. and don't know why this is happening.
 I saw a Dr. a about 6 months ago b/c of my 1st spell, he told me it was anxiety...
he put me on lexapro 10mg.
 I think it helped at 1st, I'd go a month feeling great, then BAM, id have this anxiety and it lasts for a week or 2. This is my 5th relapse of this feeling and its DRAINING ME EMOTIONALLY. 
 It makes me feel like I'm going crazy. And all I can do is THINK ABOUT IT and the symptoms... and it makes me worry more... and all I can think is "am I going to have to suffer from this the rest of my life?" "Will this feeling go a way again like it has in the past and come back in a month?"
 It's terrible. I used to be able to come home from work and sleep... now I'm constantly wired and anxious and fearful... it just sucks.
 I took myself off the lexapro a little over a month ago, and I was feeling great after all the side effects of withdrawal went away... then it came back about a week ago.
 I've been feeling like this for about 7 days now... parinoid stomach feeling and shaky... 
 I'm going to start seeing a therapist this week or next, he thinks I'm just a constant worrier.
He thinks cognitive thinking will help me.
I hope so. I wanna kick this naturally without meds.
 I want my life back.
 any thoughts or suggestions? thanks guys. I'm hanging in there.
