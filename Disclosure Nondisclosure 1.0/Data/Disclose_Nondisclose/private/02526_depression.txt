For about 4 years I've stopped enjoying all the things I love. Video games, my favourite websites, my favourite music, my friends. There are other things but I'm not exactly sure what they are. The most upsetting thing is that I'm losing interest in my favourite bands as I'm going to see a few of them at a concert in a month and I just used to enjoy them so much. Whenever I heard the songs I would get this amazing feeling and just feel so happy like everything was perfect and I would really get into it. I then realized I was getting sick of the band, so I tried listening to different bands and even music I hate to realize how great my fave band is. But it isn't working. I can't enjoy the instruments or even the lead singer's voice which used to be one of my favourite things. 
I was also losing enjoyment of talking to and being with my friends so I tried taking a break from them but I'm still not really enjoying talking to them. 
And as for games, I used to spend hours playing video games and loved doing it. Now I can't play for more than 30 min without being completely bored out of my mind. 
And I've just been feeling really bored and dull in general, with everything. 
 What's happening?!! Nothing dramatic or awful has actually happened to me, all this just slowly happened over time. I'm 19. The reason why I am telling my age is because I've heard that teenagers go through a phase where they get sick of everything. It also occured the EXACT same time I was getting acne, dry skin/hair, and a weird facial structure. Please help me, I want to enjoy life again! This is really making me feel horrible.
