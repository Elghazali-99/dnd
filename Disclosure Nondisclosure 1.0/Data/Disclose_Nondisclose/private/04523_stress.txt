ill start off by saying i was diagnosed with gad a few years ago,,,never put much thought in it,and believe everything has a true underline reason.
i have had or still experience these symptoms..
lightheadedness....feeling of cloudy headed.
gastro issues..unexplained stomach/upper gastro pain/discomfort.
insomnia,,,takes me hours to fall alseep most the time.
and a few other things but this one here is what realy bugs me....
....i get these weard tingly feelings in different parts of the body,,,feels like little cold pin pricks,,,maby one on my hand,maby one on my leg,,,but all over,and not constant,,,here and there,like nerves firing off!!
i have had ct scan on head,,2 ct scans of chest,gastro area.
barrium swallow,iodine contrast
every blood test you can imagine from diabetes to pancreas for the stomach pain,,everything comes back fine!!!
one more thing,,when i do go to sleep,,,my back hurts me so bad while i sleep i can hardly roll over to change positions!,,,,they say i suffer from stress/anxiety...and gave me lexapro,,well,that did nothing for me,,and i stopped taking it.
any thoughts on the tingley feelings?
