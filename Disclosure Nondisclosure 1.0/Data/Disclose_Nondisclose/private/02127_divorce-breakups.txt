Hi Ladies and Gents, some of you know me, 
quick rap up of the last 2 years, hubby of 30 years cheated with the bimbo next door, him 50 her 22 she went to school with our daughter. He took our life savings and partied,
 He is now broke and missing his family deeply. He still drinking and smoking (two things I hate) and still sees her and her family.
 He has never admitted to doing anything wrong and he has become more selfish I think......
 I have gone without everything to buy a home, so now I own a tiny home but it is mine and the kids and I have moved on....I am very happy with my company and the company of my little dog. I am very happy with the kids and my grandson.
 So my question is do I owe him anything? I don't love him anymore, I am sure of that. The children are happy with the way my life is now and they said they will be happy as long as I am happy. 
 The problem I feel guilty and I do not know why? I feel like I should look after him as he is lonely and not a social person? If anyone can help I would appreciate it.....thanks
