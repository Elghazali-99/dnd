I slept with a guy on the night of the 1st April and the condom broke, so I took plan b about 36 hours later. I suffered no side effects.
 I'm due for a period around today (I don't really keep track), but it hasn't arrived. My last period was around 10 March, and they tend to arrive a few days short of a month regularly.
 I checked and I shouldn't of been ovulating at the time it happened, and the heavy white discharge that I usually get around ovulation disappeared a half a week prior to the event. I haven't had any pregnancy symptoms either, but it is early.
 I'm not suffering any ill symptoms, but I've been getting all my usual symptoms that tell me that I'm due for a period (a lack of discharge but 'feeling' wet, increased appetite, mood swings, bloating) except it's been happening for the past 4 days when usually it's only the night before. 
 I know it's too early to tell but I'm really freaking out. I know plan b can mess up your cycle but how soon can I tell? By what date should I take a pregnancy test assuming I don't get my period?
