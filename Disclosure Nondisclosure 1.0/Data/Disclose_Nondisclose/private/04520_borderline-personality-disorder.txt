This is so frustrating! I've been diagnosed with BPD for a while, and I've had a great history with therapy and counseling. I won't go into detail about my story, as that's not really the point right now. 
Lately, I've come to notice that my state of mind changes every week. One week, I'll be pretty stable for the whole week, but then the next week, I'll be all over the map in terms of mood and behavior. Last week, my counselor and I decided that I would only go in for therapy on an as-needed basis, because I was doing so well. But this week, I feel like I need to see her as often as possible. 
Does anyone else struggle with this? I mean, this week's crankiness and overall depression is understandable, considering I'm about to start my cycle (I've been diagnose with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, as well) and my anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication ran out last Friday. I'm picking up the refill later today.
I'm not really looking for advice or anything, I just need to know if anyone else has some of these same issues. 
It's nice to know other people have the experience of "Wait, that's not something I'd do or say! That wasn't me!" and feeling overwhelmingly guilty. I'm so happy that we can reach out to each other like this! 
Thanks, everyone.
