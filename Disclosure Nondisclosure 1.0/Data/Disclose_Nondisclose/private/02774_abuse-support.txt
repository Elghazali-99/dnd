It's been brought to my attention that my daughters behavior is what you would consider to be not normal. I realized this a short time ago but think I was in denial about the situation, telling myself that it's normal she is just exploring her body. She has been touching her vaginal area in a very provocative way. She has touch the area and then asked my grandfather to smell her finger which I found odd, and on a recent visitation of a friend, after her bath while I was gathering her clean clothes she was showing my friend her chest/nipples and touching her vagina. She was jumping on her and rubbing her butt on her. I'm concerned that someone close to us has shown her this behavior. I asked my daughter if she had seen this maybe on TV and she said no. I asked if someone showed her these actions and she said yes. We used a doll and asked her where and she pointed to the chest and groin area. Every time she is asked she says that she can't say who did it. As if she is afraid to get into trouble. She isn't around strangers and only left alone with family members.
 One of our family members, a ten year old boy, is one of the children she plays with often. I find his behavior odd as well. He makes me feel uncomfortable, constantly hanging on me, something I've tried to ignore to avoid family conflict but now I'm concerned he has maybe shown or done something with my daughter that she is afraid to tell me. Being a single mother, and not having many friends where I currently live, I'm concerned with what may happen, but I need to figure out how to get my child to tell me how she learned this behavior before I point fingers or if this is normal and I'm overreacting. Any advice is greatly appreciated.
