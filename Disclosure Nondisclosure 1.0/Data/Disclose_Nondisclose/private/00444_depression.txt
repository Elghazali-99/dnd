I have been having difficulty breathing where i have to keep taking deep breaths, feels like my heart is racing at times, have some muscle twitching all over my body and my throat feels like it has something stuck in it, although the symptoms never seem as bad if iam not thinking about it sometimes even go completely, but when i do have these symptoms it drives me crazy, i am only 18 and its scaring the **** out of me, i went to the hospital and had an ECG done and the nurse said my heart was slightly beating to fast also had my BP done and he said it was slighlty high (but he said it might be because i was stressed about the test) he also checked my oxygen levels but they were fine, i also had a chest x ray and nothing was wrong with that, also had blood tests and they were also fine, i really don't know what is wrong with me, maybe its anxiety or depression, i am seeing my doctor tuesday for more information about it, what could this be? PLEASE HELP ITS DRIVING ME UP THE WALL, its also stopping me from going out my house to see my mates, it has also put me off eating, sometimes it scares me that much i think i am going to die. Following the trip to the hospital i went to the doctor, she took my BP and said it was fine, she never done any other tests on me because she said there was nothing wrong with me because i had the tests at the hospital and after telling her about why i might have anxiety she agreed and just sent me on my way :(
