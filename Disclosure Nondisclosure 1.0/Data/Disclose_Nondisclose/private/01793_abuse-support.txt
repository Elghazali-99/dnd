Hi everyone,
 The situation is a bit complicated. My husband has a 12-year non biological son who tried to hurt my daughter as she was 10 months old, he also threatened to harm her several times. I confronted him in front of my husband, and he didn't even deny, but my husband covered for him and defended him. 
 I asked my husband to meet the boy somewhere else, and he prefered moving out. He moved to his ex wife's and "baby sits' her 2 children, and forgets to visit with our own daughter.
 We haven't seen the boy for more than 2 years, but recently, my husband who still lives at his ex wife's house asked me to bring the boy back to our house and have him involved in our daughter's life, which scares me to death. I really don't care about my husband anymore, but I have been trying to keep a peaceful relationship for our child. But I do fear for my daughter's safety. What can I do legally to keep this boy away from my child?
 I need to add that the boy has a violence history with little girls, he hits them and finds it extremely funny. I told my husband that he has some serious mental issues, but he refuses to help him.
 Please help me, I need to protect my little girl.
 Thank you all
