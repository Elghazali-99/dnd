So it's come to the point of divorce. Finally. We've always known it would be, and always have threatened it only, we've stayed together - continuing to try, I feel, out if pity. I was dx'd with MS 2 yrs after our marriage at age 31. I am still functioning, but  going through the application process for ssi. He has gotten really nasty these past few days by depleting our joint savings which pays for my car payment, disconnected out Internet so I can only use my phone which he says will run out too. Calls me stupid and makes me feel like a complete lesser human because I am unable to work and use other ppls resources as he says. 
 He is military, has always been with me out if pity and never really had a relationship so I know this has got to end now! I'm just to the point of what should I do?  Luckily, he has never wanted children and hates them. He hates people actually so, we just need to separate. He thinks I'll due in a sink hole or something without him. Like I have not lived a life before him!?
 He wants to see a lawyer for a postnuptial so I cannot take him for alimony or pent ion, but we haven't been married long enough for that to happen. Instead I'm being treated like a stranger. A stranger he hates with passion and resentment. I am so hurt. I am so confused. What am I supposed to do?
 I lived on the opposite coast for my family and I don't want to BE with my family. They are toxic. I want to be independent. I want to be healthy. Okay, so that can't happen. Do I have any rights? Am I obligated to any health insurance or minor alimony?
