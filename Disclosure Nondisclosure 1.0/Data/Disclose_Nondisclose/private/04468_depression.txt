I didn't know where to post this question and found this place appropriate.All my life until i finished school i was a geeky guy who played football and as a only kid.I had minimum contact with my workaholic dad and more of a distant fearful relationship and supported by my mom,i excelled in studies and socially i was around knowing people and all but always a loner from inside who never shared his secrets.
 I grew up concealing my emotions and never expressing them because they made no sense to me in what i liked.Then i went to colleges very distant from my house and fell into deep depression because i cam across as a misfit idealist who had communication and emotional release issues.In a conservative society like India,it is very difficult to establish good communication channels and let us say,i learnt it the hard way.
 Now,i am at the end of my management degree and i feel very worthless because there is nothing to fight for,nothing to give my attention for and unfortunately noone to share my life with apart from my parents who i feel are not emotionally full enough to understand me.
 Most of all,i feel like a soloist fighter who is out there to save his pride and his ***.This isolates me a lot mentally and i haven't found someone to share it either.
 I fear this complexity of my mind with an ego large enough to stop my emotions from pouring out.I dont know what to do in this situation and i dont think searching for answers is any solution.
 For the society i am the kid with big degrees and a good job with cash,but inside i feel very hollow and worthless.
