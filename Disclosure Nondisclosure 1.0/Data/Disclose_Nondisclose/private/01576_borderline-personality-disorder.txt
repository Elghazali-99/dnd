I have been origionally diagnosed as ADD then ADHD then Bipolar then Manic Depressive then BPD and of course many other pill and diagnoses to fix me. Nothing has worked beyond the meds making me detached even more so or sleepy to the point I dont get out of bed. But my question is being that I have been searching to see about this issue that all the doctors ignore that I always tell them about. 
 "When watch a person talk and hear them along with other noises I seem to repeat so to say. My vision in my head not at the visual level kind of flickers up and back up then back. and the sounds dont align i hear all the words and music and stuff in my head are what seems to be compeating for a bandwidth. Like watching a streaming video ment for Cable on a dialup line. "
 Is this still apart of BPD because i have yet to hear or find this explained and yet the doctors bypass it like I make it up.  And now because no meds work I seem to have backed myself back to being broke, jobless and with a company to run that I dont know if it will.   HELP PLEASE. MAYBEE AT LEASE I CAN KNOW MORE ABOUT MY PLROBLEM. To move over it and work past it.
