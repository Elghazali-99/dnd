I don't know what has come over me. I was sexually abused for 6 years so obviously I am being diagosed with PTSD, now the thing is I am extreamly worried because everytime I lay down I hear quiet and loud voices in my head I know they're in my head because no one is around in my room and the house is dead quiet. I hear things in my head that say “Goooogle“, “Who are you?“ “what's your name?“ “ Sarah“  “Saaarrraaahhh“ “Kill them“ “AGGHHHH“ “OUCH!“ and they really scare me and my paranoria is awfull sometimes I can't go on the streets because I feel i'm not safe and going to die and people are talking about me. I feel Aliens and god and some demons need me for a long term propersition. I can't help but think about suicide, and I can't help but obsess about things the thing I am obsessed about is the Police I don't want to be obsessed about these things my mind just thinks them, Like if I see something dirty I think about the germs and bacteria it discusses me and makes me sick. And food is the wourst everytime I eat I either feel sick or be sick. I cry everynight I talk to myself when I go into tears and I feel like I'm talking with god or the Aliens. Please help me what is going on???? :'(
