How do u cope with ur BPD while trying to be a parent a the same time? I know that my BPD is getting in the way of me being a good parent. Its getting worse for me. I've just been started on new meds so I know its going to take some time to adjust, but I'm really worried that I'm being a horrible parent to my babies. They are 2 and 4, and I can't handle the stresses of everyday life with them. And it doesn't help that I rarely get a break from them. I'm a stay at home mom, and my ex husband never gets them for his weekend visits, so the only time I get a break is when my parents babysit for a couple of hrs so my bf and I can so to a movie or something. My bf watches them anytime I want to get out, but I usually lack the motivation to go out unless he goes with me. I don't normally like going out without him, but once I get out I do have fun. Its just that initial part of getting the motivation to get up and go. I realize I need to make time for myself, but all of that aside, I'm having alot of trouble keeping my patients with the little things. I'll be in the kitchen cooking and if my son comes in there asking me for a drink I'll flip out and go crazy with yelling and cussing. And I can't handle the little kids arguments they have and the crying and whining. But hell, they're both just little kids! I get tremendous help from my bf, who often has to handle all the situations for me, but I still need to be able to do it myself. I don't want my kids to grow up with a mom like me. Sometimes I think they would be better off without me. I hear about ppl who grow up with a parent like me, and their story is never a good one. I'm SOOOOO worried of my kids growing up to be disturbed. What can I do to keep that from happening?
