When I was about 14 I got the gaurdasil vaccinations. I am now 18 and was diagnosed with HPV about 4 months ago when I was still 17. 
The first doctor I went to told me I contracted multiple different strains of HPV, including high risk HPV. I did not contract any strains that cause genital warts. She said I had squamous cells on my cervix, and that they would turn into precancerous cells and that I would develop cancer. She said we could treat it for some time and then after some time I would have to get a hysterectomy. She assured me this WOULD happen. Not maybe or probably. 
I went to anther gynecologist for a second opinion. She looked at my medical file without even taking a pap smear, and assured me I had nothing to worry about. She assured me that unless I was worried about an infection, I shouldn't get another pap smear til I'm 21. She told me that since I'm young, my body would fight off the virus, and I would not develop cancer, and my fertility would not be affected. 
Having these two drastically different opinions is very terrifying. Who do I listen to? What should I do? I am terrified if not being able to have children.
