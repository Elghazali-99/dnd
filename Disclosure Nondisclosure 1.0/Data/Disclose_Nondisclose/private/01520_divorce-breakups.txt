What are some encouraging ways to get my husband to seek employment. He doesn't deal well with being spoken to in a mean or orderly way, I guess that came from being self employed for over 20 years in the cab business and now with the lagging economy he has been forced to punch a clock and have a boss over him, he tends to get fired a lot and now has lost interest in find a job. As a result we have lost our home and are having trouble paying the bills and keeping a roof over our heads in the now rented house that we live in. I don't know how much more I can bare in loss and worry. I am too good of a woman, wife to have to suffer like this. I had to file bankruptcy and still lost my home, I was offered fulltime on my job and that was a blessing, however I believe that if I tell my husband that I was offered fulltime on my job he my never go looking for a job. Do you know why he acts this way and how my I boost his self-esteem and encourage him to seek employment as if losing our home already didn't do the trick?I would like to hear more comments from men as a man may know what another man may be feeling or going through. Your positive response  would be greatly appreciated.
