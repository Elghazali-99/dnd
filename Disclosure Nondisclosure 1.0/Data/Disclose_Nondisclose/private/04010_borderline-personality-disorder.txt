I am a 50 a Registered nurse and mother of 3 boys. I was married to a sadistic, abusive man for 25 years, who I finally divorced 5 years ago. 5 years ago i began therapy with a very experienced and wonderful therapist for PTST and panic disorder. He has been very helpful in allowing me to lean and understand my patterns of behavior. Last week during my session, we were again discussing why I staed in such a horrific marriage for all those years. He said that since I was so struggeling with that question for so long, that he would give me the answer. He said that I was the sadist and that for all those years I used Reaction Formation and lived vicariously through my husband and that I was the sadist. I haven't been back since and that was last week. I cannot accept that and feel that sadists are the lowest of the low and like leaches live off others, and are not deserving to live and yet that is who I am. I don't understand, I never hurt anyone or received any enjoyment from pain and suffering of others. I've spent my life helping and have no bad thoughts or intentions. Please help me understand this diagnosis. i don't feel there is any place here for me anymore and have been very depressed and physically ill overe this thought and it consumes me. I can't even go to work anymore and now question ewvery thought or feeling wondering if that is really how i think or feel or is it just the opposite. I'm not sure who I even am. Please, please help me to understand
