Back in Feb I started feeling very achey in all my muscles after beginning to hit the gym on a regular basis. After a couple of particularly long and hard sessions where I probably did more than I should these aches just would not go away which got me abit worried. Very randomly a few weeks later whilst standing at a gig I felt my breath getting quite short and feeling breathless whilst just standing still which I found very strange. About a week later I had a panic attack for the first time which afterwards I was feeling rather breathless every day and still achey. I noticed that leaning on certain body parts caused me to tremble as the muscles felt rather week. Anyway after a holiday to the States in which I had 2 more panic attacks, I had a tight band of pressure around my head, the aches continued and I was more and more breathless. I went to the docs several times, had blood tests which were all clean, and ECG which showed my heart was fine, yet when I'd been laying in bed I would feel my heart thud then I wouldn't feel anything and when this happened a strange wave would go over my body and almost make me jump. This has continued, I'm still aching head to toe months later. When I'm laying down I'll feel dizzy, when I walk my back feels weak and feels like its pulling down my left side of my body from the head downwards. I have a cough, sometimes my left lung feels really pressure. Its stopping me enjoying any part of life. I'm convinved its not stress or anxiety as I really have NOTHING to feel that way about. I haven't had a panic attack in weeks but everythings presisting. 
 I simply don't know what to do!
