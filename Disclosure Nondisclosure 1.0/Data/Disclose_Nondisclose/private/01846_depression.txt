Since may 24, I have has a mystery illness tht has put me in the er twice and I've seen 8-9 different doctors about. I have a VERY wide range of symptom but the most bothersome ones are constantly feeling severe fatigue. My muscles and body hurt so bad it's extremely hard for me to get out of bed, and I haven much at all in the past couple months. When I do get up ad move around I get very dizzy and often feel like I'm gonna pass out. My head often feels so stuffy and pressure that I can't think of concentrate at all.. Not even enough to drive anymore. My vision messed up sometimes and that's another reason I'm scared to drive lately. I get sharp pains in my head and numbness in limbs... I constantly feel short of breath... I've lost my job over the fact tht I can't really get out of bed. The last dr I went to said since I'm only 24 and I've seen tons Of drs and they can't find anything - I must be depressed. No offense to you all that have it but I jut got married am very happy and love my life. I just don't see a reason for me to be depressed... Even when I'm stuck in bed, it's not like I want to be there.. I. Lay in bed and pray god please heal me so I can have the strength to get up and have my life back and have a blast with my hubby and friends like I always have... I don't have anything I can think to be depressed about besides the fact I can't get a diagnoses is a little depressing and scary.... Anyways  at this point I'm desperate for answer because like I Said I'm 24 and can't be out of bed for almost 2 months and it *****. I'm desperate for any answer, so even though I really don't think I'm depressed could it be possible ?
