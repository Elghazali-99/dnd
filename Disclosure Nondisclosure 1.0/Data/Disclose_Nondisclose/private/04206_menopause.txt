Hello all, this is a helpful blog in knowing I am not a creature from the wrinkle planet all alone.  I am 50 years old and the past year I have lost around 75 lbs. I have been up and down the scale all my life but this time I developed tiny wrinkles on my elbows under my arms and around my arm pits, lower stomach and of all things my lower butt and thighs. They are awful. It would not be appropriate for me to wear shorts or a swim suit. I have never had this happen and I have thought it was just due to the weight loss but as I have read the blogs, it seems I too had a sudden on set of wrinkles, like over night. They are odd. My veins are also raised, almost like they want to pop out of my skin. Its strange. They hurt when they buldge.  Looking back , I too have taken antibiotics as named in the other blogs. I will give Gold Bond a try. What have any of us got to loose-wrinkles maybe.  Man , my face is good, but my body looks the age of my 72 year old mom-no harm intended.   Until next time.
