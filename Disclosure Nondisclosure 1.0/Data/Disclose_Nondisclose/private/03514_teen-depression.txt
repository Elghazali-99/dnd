Im not sure if this has anything to do with depression ( which i most likely have), but i feel like an attention seeker. Its mostly from adults such as teachers or sometimes even strangers around me. Well i consider it as trying to be noticed, but what if i am an attention seeker. I dont mean to, but i constantly find myself crawling up to my teachers, trying to prove that i am a responsible girl who works hard. And sometimes i find myself constantly talking to most of them, just so they are able to help me with some of my problems and talk to me. They are all very kind, but i want to stand out in the teachers eyes. I also find myslef sometimes wanting hugs from them. Well the hugs are a way of saying thank you for teaching me and for helping, but i want them to think of me as a friend not just a student. I always want to be around them which makes me feel grown up and trustworthy. Is this normal?? I am 13 years old by the way, and it has been going on for at least 2 years. I am also a girl, who goes to a girl school. Am i an attention seeker?? Or is there something wrong with me?? I just want to be beautiful too...
