Hi.  I've been under a doctor's and therapist's care for a couple of years dealing with generalized anxiety and mild depression.  I've also been fighting fatigue over that time, which still hasn't been ruled out as something physical.  In May, my doctor prescribed 20mg of adderall (amphetamines) to take each morning to help fight the fatigue, lethargy and lack of motivation.  It had worked very well for a while -- I was able to work regularly and very effectively.
 Lately, things are different.  I've hardly had the energy to work and I've missed a lot of time over the last few weeks.  The adderall isn't helping the way it used to, BUT, as has always been the case, I still have sort of "nervous" energy and it still elevates my pulse - which is why I'd hesitate to ask for a higher dose.  I used to be able to skip doses when I felt I didn't need it, like when I'd rest home on Sundays, but when I had done that more recently, I wound up sleeping 12++ hours a day.
 Has anyone else experienced this?  I know of building up a tolerance to it, but I haven't found anything about the positive effects going away but not the negative ones.  Thanks.
