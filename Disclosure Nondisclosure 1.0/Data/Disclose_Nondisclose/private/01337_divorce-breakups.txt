How can a man leave a women who is pregnant (high risk)? This is my first chips but its but his so this isn't his first rodeo with pregnancy. He just didn't seem to care. I know he feels like he can't provide for us so its better to just part ways but I feel its so selfish! Its would be so much easier for me mentally if I had his support. He's done a 360 from the man that I knew. Its like he has lost respect for me. I know he's just as confused bc he called me last week after a month of treating me like **** manipulating me for sex and money he called saying he mused me and wanted us back but where the f is he now! I'm so hurt.and now he had this plan to move out of state! Really really are you kidding me! We had a great relationship. Our only arguments were stemmed by him not feeling confident in providing for us but I was there to hold him and tell him we will get through this. Please some advice. I wish I could fine the words to say to get him to see its wrong.  Why do I have to go through this without him. He should be with me every night taking care of me like I take care of him. I feel so bad for this baby. I barely have money to eat properly and I'm so depressed. He knows all this and still is out and about living a joyful life. Or so it seems
