I really need some advice.  Here's my situation.  I have a 6 week beautiful baby boy.  He's the love of my life.  His father and I are not together romantically.  He's someone I've known for years.  We are raising our little boy together as friends.  As of now he's paying child support, visits every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday.  He's such a great father and truly loves our little boy.  Starting next week my son and I will be going to his house every Friday for the night for the time being.  He doesn't know much about children and still needs some supervision :)  He's learning though.  Here's my question, I'm worried about the future.  Especially once I start dating again.  I just know that that will upset him and things won't go as easily as they have been.  I keep hearing about joint custody.  Something like two weeks with the mother and two weeks with the father?  That CAN'T be good on the child!  How does all this work?  What is the typical visitation schedule that you all have?  I'm just devastated to think about this joint custody thing.  I REALLY need some answers on this whole thing.  How does this work if the courts get involved?  I pray it doesn't go there but just in case.  Also, does the child's age have anything to deal with the courts decision (I'm not breastfeeding anymore)?  Any advice would be great.  Thanks so much for you time.
