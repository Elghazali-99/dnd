Hi, so here's the deal. I got very sick with the stomach bug, stressed over finals, started a back breaking job, and have been running everyday in training for cross country. Now, my boyfriend and I have been sexually active for a year now, but we started having sex after a little break back in May, May is also the last month I had my period (we always always always use condoms), and I nor my partner has noticed problems or breakage with the condoms we've used. However, I skipped my period this past June. (Today is July 3rd fyi). Now, skipping periods for me isnt so uncommon, last summer I had a 79 day cycle (which I thought I was pregnant because I was uber scared of why it was so long.) My cycles go from 28 days , to 37 days, to 41 days on up. Lately, like this last week of June and now, I am bloated, like 5 pounds, I crave sugar, my face is breaking out, and these are all my usual period symptoms. Now, according to my self monitoring by my head and guessing, I should have gotten my period at the end of June, like a week or half week before the end. According to two of my period tracking apps, one says I am 4 days late, the other says it should come today. Like I said I skip every so often, especially the summer, but still, it's nerve racking. Well, I don't have my period, I'm a little nevous, typical! but I read and now I've started wtihin the last day to take a lot of vitamin c (which has rose hips... I know, not the best to use to bring on a period but its what I have at home) to try to bring it on.
So anybody, please with nice but honest advice, do you think I am safe and will get my period?
