So quick history. nearly 7 years ago i met my wife. I am 39 and shes 40. She has 2 boys now 14 and 15 . This issue with the 14 year old has become really bad around age 12 to 14. 
 Now i'm old school, I believe the role of a step parent is the same as a biological parent .
 That said, i want to reach this kid, but hes a lot worse at hating me then his 15 year old.
 We butt heads like arch enemy's. Clearly I do not want that. Yet all attempts to make peace have failed, it is all coming to head sooner then later I am afraid. If this don't stop I fear the worst.
 He is prone to violent abusive out right un acceptable behavior. 
 List of all tried is quite long. 
 It has come to the point hes breaking a lot in the house. Attacking me and his mother physically and verbal. 
 I hate you 
 F you
 i hate this house
 i wish you all stay out of my life you worthless piece of sh**
 and so on, I tell ya what , hes got a really bad temper that is scary.
 His mother says she was the same way , but she turned out fine. Yes his real father is a real piece of work. Needless to say his real father , the boys real dad plays no part in there life but to hurt there mother. He uses them like tools to hurt her.
 I need to save my marriage , I have got to reach this kid. 
 Ill admit as of late my like for this kid is gone. This is clearly not helping matters.
 I guess I just need advise on how to stop this . Clear to me he resents the hell out of me, im the dad his dad isnt. 
 I get it, my dad left at 5 years old never to return. I accept i'm part to blame , never ending fight. 
 Difference is , I wish to end it.
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
