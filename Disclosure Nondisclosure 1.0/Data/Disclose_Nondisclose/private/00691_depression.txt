I met my current boyfriend 5 years ago. We were friends first and he told me a lot about his current girlfriends,
At the time it didn't bother me at all because I was also doing my own thing.  We started dating and were always best friends but after I got pregnant things changed. I gained 100 pounds with my pregnancy and it made me feel even worse. I have always had depression issues since as long as I can remember. I have always hated the way that I looked, I lost 85 pounds from the pregnancy. I still hate myself and have always dieted since I was 11. I don't know what to do. My son is now 18 months and when I am with him I feel fine and just about my son. When I am around my fiancé wherever we are I hate myself to the extreme. I want to drink and cry about how I look. Everyone my whole life has told me I was pretty but I can't believe it.. My fiancé is loved by my family and always used to reassure me but its changed.  I sincerely am lost, I have seen a counselor and talked about this. She has told me it isn't reality and I need to realize what that is but to me the fact that I'm disgusting is reality. The hate for myself is overwhelming, I have attempted suicide before my son 2 times. My son is the drive for me going to college and not taking that step but I'm lost..
