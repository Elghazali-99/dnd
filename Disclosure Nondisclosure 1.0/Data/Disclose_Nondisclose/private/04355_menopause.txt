i've read similar questions to mine; but did not see any real solutions. i have been experiencing severe hot flashes, along with extreme night sweats...for almost 10 yrs now. i'm SO tired of it! i had a hysterectomy in 1999 (i am 55)- i was prescribed hormones afterward; but didn't take them long, and don't want to. i am taking black cohash now- when i can remember anyway, lol...& at one point tried to start a routine of apple cider vinegar, 1 tablespoon a day- but that didn't last long because i ended up with stomach problems. (not sure if it was due to the vinegar..or what, but it was at the same time, so i quit) anyway, i have seen advertised on tv a new product called "icool", i believe... but don't know of anyone using it, so have no idea if it's worth trying. i need a sure-cure...i seriously can't take this. people are very noticeable of it....i'll be pouring literally buckets of sweat...when everyone else has coats on! it's so embarrassing and uncomfortable; and interferes with sleep greatly! can someone steer me toward a sure-fire solution?
