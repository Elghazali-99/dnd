Noo it's bringing me down. I keep thinking off the night I talked to my youth pastor and told I've tryed to kill myself and how when she asked what I did I just couldn't find the words I tryed telling her but my mouth just wouldn't let the words come out. And I feel so rude for telling at the time. I did send her a email telling her what I did but I still fill incredibly ride for just not telling her. She asked 3 times and I just sat there silent trying to tell her. The she said you dint want to tell me so you  I did want to tell her and I feel it made her feel I don't trust her or she did something wrong to make me nit tell her but I did want to tell her she hasn't dine anything wrong I wanted to tell her but I just couldn't it almost makes me feel like I was ignoring her but I wasn't but still it makes me feel so rude and crappy. It makes me hate myself
 How can I stop feeling crappy about this because I did send her a message saying
 "you asked how tryed and I wanted to tell you but I just couldn't find the words so I'll tell you over facebook I used a plastic bag. I know ending it isn't the awnser but sometimes it's the only thing I can think of"
How can I get myself to stop bearing up on myself for this because I know I told her in the end but my mind won't let that be enough I can't forgive myself!!!!
