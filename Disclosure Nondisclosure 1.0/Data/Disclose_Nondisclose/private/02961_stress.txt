Recently I have been having more frequent episodes of nearly passing out.  I can feel it coming on.  It starts with a fuzzy and lightheaded feeling in my head, which spreads to my face, arms, fingers, shoulders.  I then feel a rush of warmth and tingling spread from my head to toes (this I can feel progressing).  I have to focus very hard on staying conscious.  I feel if I stop fighting it I will faint.  This happened three times in a half hour period a few nights ago, and then a couple days later it happened at work, where my boss drove me to the ER.  They did blood work and nothing came back, except a slightly elevated blood level on a test that he said could indicate anything from allergies to a heart attack.  He seemed to be leaning towards wanting me to get a MRI, but couldn't find anything at that point that would warrant ordering one.  I have an appointment with my family physician on Monday. 
 About a year and a half ago I was in the emergency room with the same thing and then they attributed it to stress.  At that point I was terribly stressed with my job, but have since moved on to a job that I love.
 I am 35 years old, not overweight and don't feel terribly stressed.
 Needless to say I am concerned about this because it seems that it can happen at any time,whether sitting, standing or lying down.  I don't want this to happen while I'm driving and take the chance that I actually pass out behind the wheel with my little girl in the car with me!!!
