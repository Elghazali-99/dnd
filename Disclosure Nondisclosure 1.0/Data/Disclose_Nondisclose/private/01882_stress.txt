How do I go about asking questions who do I talk to feel lost in a sea of fear and reality of it once time I fill my heart hurting every night father has Alzheimer's and is very bad off, my mother is the sole caretaker, i'm afraid she will lose it one day, she seems so stoic unlike me. My brother has a bad drug addiction and is very bad off, in September of last year I lost my aunt that I grew up with and her husband all into weeks along with my husbands  great-grandmother, (I was more upset than he was ) and a dear family friend all within two weeks!  Since I was a little girl I have imagine losing my parents I fear this it's coming close and I need help because I worry about my twin sisters my aunts that I have already lost half of at a young age. I can't stand to imagine losing another one. I stay awake and worry about them, and checking on my son. He is 19 and doesn't understand why check to make sure he's breathing. I have even started checking on his animals to make sure he doesn't wake up and see them dead. He has Aspberger  syndrome and his animals are everything to him, when he loses them he breaks down. Which in turn makes me go into a tail spin of depression for him. I worry more about the people I love than myself. My husband is a mechanic I spend my entire day worrying that car will fall on him. I am not suicidal just worrying myself to death I think. Any advise would be helpful, so far the posts have read have been. Is there a cure for this fear of loss of loved ones or is it something you have to work through. I personally am not worrying about my own death. I worry about my loved ones and I can't get it out of my head since I've been a small child I have worried about them. I even have nightmares about how they will die. I would love some help from someone that has been through a similar experience. I feel lost and afraid.
