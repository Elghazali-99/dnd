I have been treatment resitant depression for 15years, suboxone has been my miracle life saver, as well as my mother who uses it ( wisely) after even her ECT never worked. i have been on 24 medications, only suboxone has saved my life. ( in never use opiates except once when i was desperate i dabbled for a few weeks)
the only problem is that it seems to lose effect on me ( not my mother- perhaps cause she alternates between 2-4 mg a day) whereas i never go past 4 mg a day. i find that for me only, it poops out after about 4 months, and i have been taking drug holidays which i am miserable as i only have a lousy anti-depressant to help me out.
the withdrawals are rough- today is day 5 no suboxone. is this long enough holiday so that i can go back on it again and have the same 2mg a day work? i used to take 1 and a half weeks off but it is too hard.
please can you advise me how to detox rapidly and keep my tolerance down.
also please save any stupid lectures about how depressives should  not take suboxone- you have NO IDEA how hellish my life was two years ago for so many years until suboxone saved me. the holidays are damn worth it!
i can now work, and feel like a normal person, no anti- depressant, mood stabilizer etc has ever worked long so please keep your own judgements to yourself- unless you have a clue of how dehabilitating depression is- i used to cut my wrists, attempt suicide again and again - suboxone has made me normal - and my mom is great too.
ie. please just answer my question and save your judgements. i have been on suboxone 2 years and it is my lifesaver, i am sick of the criticism and yeah i have heard it all.
