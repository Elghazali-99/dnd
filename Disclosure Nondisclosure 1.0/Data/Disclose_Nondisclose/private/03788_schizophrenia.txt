I have always been afraid of things that aren't there. I always think that there is something behind me and that is going to kill me. I'm constantly paranoid. I'm 14 btw. I always think that there are these monsters controlling my life. For example if I'm taking a shower, I have to continue singing exactly what they want or else they'll electrocute me. 
I treat all inanimate objects as if they are alive and have feelings. I even talk to them. I have to treat them kindly or else they will attack me. At one point I was convinced I was a vampire (I know right.) 
sometimes I hear voices that I know aren't really there, but I listen to them or speak to them anyways. I talk to myself a lot too. 
 Also I have trouble concentrating and focusing. People have to repeat something to me about 5 times before I actually hear it then I forget it. I am constantly having to ask "what?" "What did you say?" I can't take it anymore. I'm so lost in my own world. 
I also went through a time of cutting myself (I've stopped a while ago, and have no desire to do it again) and depression. 
 I also get horrible anxiety and I get panic attacks for no reason. I get panic attacks when I feel as though something is trying to kill me (nothing is there) and I run as fast as I can and I don't stop until I can't run anymore. It's awful.
 Do I maybe have schizophrenia or some sort of mental disorder?
