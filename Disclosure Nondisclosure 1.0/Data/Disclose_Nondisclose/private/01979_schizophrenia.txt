For Years now i Have felt myself slipping farther and farther out of Humanity and into something more ....Primal i Am getting Violent and Enjoying it almost reveling it it the worse it is the better i find myself encased in it.. I can no longer define Pleasure and Rage or Pain as they all have the same effect on me....Like a overwhelming Extacy. I find myself free from morals and fear ... I find i have Halucinations of Killing people even Eating them ..and i am not discusted by this i find i lose myself in my head for hours in delusions of mindless violence and Screaming voices in my head and all around. I feel impowerd and indestructable Like the more Primal i become The Higher up the food chain i become I feel as if... as if i am a Predator and im the only one. I hear people speak of love and i just dont...i dont love anyone or anything.. I feel no remorse or sorrow or pitty. . . now i know i didnt have a easy childhood i was molested tortured with pins in my nails or set fire to objects like rolled up news paper and beaten with them ... So it wasnt what you would call normal... so my point is this What is it i am becoming ... Because its no longer part of humanity ... so what is it. And is it bad that i Enjoy it?.
