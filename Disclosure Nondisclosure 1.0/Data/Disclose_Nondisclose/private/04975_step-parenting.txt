i met my wife when her daughter [whose biological dad died before she was two] was almost 7 and our relatonship has been good nuntil recenly when she was thirteen and started to mix with wrong crowds she would often lie about her daily adventures, including subscribing to dating sites that charge various amounts which would later be deducted from airtime. even when you asked imediately that she explain her story properly ity would change instantly and she would claim she never gave you a different version moments earlier. i then started recording everytime i ask and then re-run the different versions. even with such evidence the mother would try to coverup by humiliating me infront of her daughter playing the "'because she is not your biological daughter" card. althouugh later she would apologyse to me secretly telling me she has already talked with her seperately. it was until her mother's young sister recently told her not  to obey us because 'your father is dead' you can do whatever you want, thats when she was turnng 14. She qickly adjusted to  that notion the same day and has been like that since. things got worse when she would call  ,me names and said she would prefere i leave and her mother find another man of her liking rrght in my face. i even try to be super calm even when the verbal abuse originating from  lying about anything she is  asked  about, including biut not loimitedd to wirting her name in ink or markers annd sharp objects on the walls, furniture even the home theatre system i bought last November. most  of the tiome i feel l;ike i live in a wrong world. as of today i feel hatred towards her towards the mother because i believe she is insrumental ins her behaviour which includes doing thew opposite of what is asked of her. i ask myself daily if all stepparents go  through this,, and is  there going to be an end to this. Maybe its time we separate and resolve our marriage dispite having our own 2 daughters aged 1 and 6.
