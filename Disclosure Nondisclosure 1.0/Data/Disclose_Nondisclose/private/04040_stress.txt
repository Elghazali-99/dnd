Hello, I'm 27 female, 140lbs non-smoker or drug abuser, barely even drink alcohol.  Sorry for having such a long post, just trying to cover everything I can think of right now.  Two years ago I got really, really stomach sick after a round of Keflex to treat a skin infection.  I first became sick directly after finishing my round of antibiotics (I have tried porbiotics) and had most of the symptoms listed below for about a year and a half and then I had a few months over the spring and summer were I almost felt normal again, just a few days here and there were my stomach felt out of whack.  But my symptoms have recently come back in almost full force.  I know I'm stressed about them now, but I don't remember being stressed before they came on again.  My current symptoms have lasted about 3 months maybe a little less now and are:
 *Extreme nausea pretty much the whole time I'm awake from the second I wake up, Its not effected by foods I eat. (if I can eat, right now all I eat is crackers, bagels, and potatos) and it does not cause me to vomit.
*Diarrhea, at the most a few times a week, again not effected by what I eat.
*Some discomfort/sick feeling in my intestinal area, that's not always related to when I have diarrhea.
*A dull pain in my tail bone area, but its pretty rare.
*Sometimes before I begin to feel like I'm actually going to vomit, my arms will get numb and tingel and I have really bad diarrhea, this has happend to me maybe seven times over the past two years. Once or twice I passed out after.  Oh this also always happends directly from waking up in the middle of the night, except for once. Really weird and scary!
*Dizzy/light headed on some days
*My thoughts and memory is a little foggy
*Hair falls out a lot (its maybe about half as full as it used to be, but no bald patches)
* Very tired, even if I get a ton of sleep
*Bad breath, and I brush my teeth regulary, also very bad taste.
* All over dull body ache that will come one every few months, doesn't seem related to my stomach problems but worth mentioning.
 So far all the testing I've had done has been through a GI and some blood work through my PCP.  So far I've had a ultra sound of my gallbladder (liver, spleen and kidneys), 3 endoscopies, a colonoscopy, a sigmoidoscopy, all of which were normal.  Regular blood panel, Tested for bacterial over growth, not lactose intolerant, checked for celiac a few times. negative for H. Pilori, negative for C.diff. Um, Ive been tested for all types of hepatitis. I don't have Lyme, no campylobacter, Salmonella, or Shigella.  HCG,QUAL (i don't even know what that is) is negative.  I'm almost positive I've had my thyroid checked but I don't have the records for it, so maybe they didn't.  I think that's it.  Next Monday I will be getting a small bowl x-ray, I have a feeling nothing is going to turn up, and then I get to go back in to see my Gastroenterologist on the 23rd.
 The medications (including ones that are otc) I've tried are Prilosec, Promethazine, Gas-X, citrucel, probiotics, beano, digestive enzyms, asefex (sp?), Omeprazole, Reglan, Donparidone, A few anti-spazmotics but I don't remember the names, Kapidex, Librax,... I think that's all, nothing has helped at all except for the Promethazine (but that might be just because in knocks me out) My doctor wont give me more because they don't like to keep people on it long term. 
 I'm currently on Benzol (its a drug for IBS, even though I'm pretty possative I don't have IBS) for about 3 weeks now, not noticing much of a difference.  I also take Prozac and Klonapin, I started them about a month or two after I first got sick, because I couldn't take it anymore, and I would start to panic which makes everything worse.
 Is this all just stress?  Please let me know if you guys think there are any other areas I should be pursuing?  Or if you guys can think of any help I would be so grateful.  I've been to a few PCP's and a few GI's and so far nothing has come up as to why I am feeling so, so bad all of the time.  I just switched to a new therapist because my old one stopped taking my insurance (I'm not sure I like her though)  I'm getting to my wits end with this.  Please let me know any other info I can give you might think will help.  Thanks so much in advance guys, I could really use any help.
