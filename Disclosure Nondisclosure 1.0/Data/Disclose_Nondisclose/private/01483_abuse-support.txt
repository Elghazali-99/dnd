I am the single mother of a 3 &1/2 year old son. My son has been in daycare since he was 1. He has always loved daycare. In about the last month or 2 I have noticed some big changes in him. He always used to love telling me about his day (he speaks very well), but now when I ask him he only says "it was a good day" or something simple like that and then talks about something else.
 He has been acting out a lot as well. He is very moody. He has never been easy to put to sleep, but lately it is rare for him to sleep before midnight! I don't want to create a situtation that may not be there, but I am very concerned with a new teacher (_____) at his daycare. My son has told me that _____  gives him massages at nap time. last week he told me (out of the blue) that he gave ____ a massage. About a week & 1/2 ago my mother piced him up from daycare and the teacher(_____) told my mom that my son had been acting very bad for the past 2 - 3 weeks. He has never said this to me. He tells me all the time that my son is wonderful! 
 When I asked _______ infront of the director of the daycare (in an unconfrontational manner) he said that my son had just been a little grumpy for the past few days, but he had not seen me to tell me this. However, I had seen ______ and spoke to him every day of that same week? The director also told me that she is not sure why he would say this because my son has always been well behaved there. My son tells me that there is a "scarry secret" that he can't tell me because it is to "scarry". He often talks about a monster that is going to break his toys/ flush him down the toilet/ swallow him, etc. This is not normal!
 Nothing has changed in our home situtation. I have mentioned my concerns to the director, but she says that all of the other parents love _____.  I have suggested that there may be a another child (a bully) in the class. She said that she willI keep a better watch. I have concedered switching daycares, but I am worried that if I take him away from all of his friends and something is going on, my son will think he has done something wrong! I keep second guessing my gut feeling. I don't know how to deal with this and I think I may be over reacting. I don't know how to ask my son questions without putting things in his head. am I overacting? What should I do?
