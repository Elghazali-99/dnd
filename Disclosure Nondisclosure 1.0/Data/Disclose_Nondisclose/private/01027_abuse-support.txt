so as far as I can remember since I was a little girl all my memories seem to be really graphic and scary at times I have nightmares and still get this ugly pit feeling in my stomach when the clock strikes 4
My mom got pregnate when she was 16 in mexico my grandmother made her move to the U.S and thats where she met my worst nightmare she married her husband who was a drug adict and he himself was abused as a kid almost beat to death at times. 
 He would hit me so hard my head would hurt for days, he would pull my hair so hard that it would come out in chunks I have no happy memories as a child I was always scarded and I thought that was normal . he would call me a stupid B and insult me in every way telling me my mom didnt love me and she only defended me to fight with him. I remember him hitting my mom kicking her on the floor and my mom still stayed with him I felt alone and always scared . He didnt allow me to leave the house I was being timed comming home from the school bus He would touch me in bad places he runined my childhood he runined my life I spent about 16yrs with him till high school where my mom moved out with me Till this day my mom does not know about him touching me Im scared to tell her because the sad thing is even though we moved out she countines to see him I have no communication with him all I hold is hate towards him and im sorry but I hold it against my mother at times I feel like the past is never going to stop hunting me theres so much more I wanna put on here but im scared. help me
