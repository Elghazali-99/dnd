you have no idea how happy I am to have found this site. My man has been going through this for well over 5 months.Hes 50 years old and we have lived together for 16 years.  He has had over 30 different blood tests. The neurologist  sent him for a brain scan and said he has something called "small vessel ischemic  disease chronic" which means the small vessels in the brain are closing up(with plague) and not allowing enough blood to the brain. He said that his heavy drinking is causing it. Personally, I think a doctor is responsible for his brain damage because he had a fatty tumor on his neck for years and years and for some reason it must have got scratched or something caused it to become infected and it swelled up really large.It was located right over his caroided artory.
well he went to a walk in clinic and a PA(correct me if I am wrong but doesnt that stant for Physician assistant???? they cant even write perscriptions!!! Well he cut it and sucked out the pus and stitched it up. Well I swear right after that I started noticing a change in his personallity. He use to be so funny and kid around and talk, talk,talk. He slowly became quiet, depressed, got shaky and weak.has diarreah all the time. would wake up with the dry heaves every morning. Couldnt go to work(this man worked for the same company for 22 years!!)and never missed a days work. he had almost a year of vacation time built up he liked his job so much!! Anyway, when ever I mentioned this surgery to the nuerologist and the internest and our primary doctor, they all blew it off. I think they are just covering their buts against law suits, so I dont know what to do. He tried taking antidepressants but they made him so weak and shakey he had to use a walker.When he stopped taking them he got better. I dont know what to do. Is there a doctor out there???? I see everyone with questions but no answers!! help all of us out. Its no fun living with a stranger!!!!!!!
