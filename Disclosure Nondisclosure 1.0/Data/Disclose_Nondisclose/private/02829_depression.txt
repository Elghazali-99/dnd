I am very depressed. My family and "friends" want me to withdraw from school this semester. I do not think that is a good idea for me because I am in my last semester of graduate school, set to graduate May 11, 2013. I feel as though I cannot just give up now when I only have 3 months left. I have been seeing the school therapist for my depression since October, but recently my family became aware of it. This has made things so much worse for me, now they have created all these new rules, for example, I had to switch my whole schedule around so all my classes fell on Tuesday and Thursday and I have to make the drive (2hr) home every Thursday night and stay until Monday night. They believe I need to be around family to get better but I feel the complete opposite. I cannot get any of my work done around the house, they all treat me different, they know nothing about depression and I feel I am getting worse and worse everyday. To the point where suicide crossed my mind, when my sister said she would drive me back and forth to all my classes. Every time I try to leave home and head back to campus, they refuse until I beg them and they all think I hate them, but I don't. I was doing fine when they didn't know about this. Also, everyone blames my boyfriend for my problems, but they do not know we were struggling with this together and leaning on each other. Now I cant see him anymore and its adding to my stress.  I feel I am out of options.
