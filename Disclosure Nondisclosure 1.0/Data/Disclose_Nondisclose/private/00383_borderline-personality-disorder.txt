Sorry if this is long...
I was diagnosed with BPD almost a year ago and within a month of my diagnosis my psychiatrist bailed on me. She left me high and dry which sent me into a depressed and suicidal spiral.... I was hospitalized and set up with the hospital psychiatrist. He worked with me for one session and when my family doctor(FD) discussed with him my previous diagnosis that was it I never had another session and so I was left in the hospital on lock down. 3 weeks later I left the hospital at my FD request. Over the next few months she controlled my meds and set me up with her in practice Social Worker. We met weekly and she again confirmed my diagnosis of BPD after about the third week. In our next session she was distant and cold and very unfriendly so that was my last session... I returned to my family doctor and and she continued to monitor my meds while trying to get me a new psychiatrist. It fell through.. nobody wanted to work with me. And then in the summer my family doctor left the practice and I was placed with a new doctor. She doesn't even know what BPD is and she stopped all my meds except my depression meds. And has refused to try to work with me. So I went out on my own trying to find a psychiatrist but I can't afford anyone as I have no insurance. Then this fall we lost our mental health unit for the county all together.... I have no professional support and I have been spiraling out of control with the complete feeling of total abandonment. Any advice would be appreciated.
