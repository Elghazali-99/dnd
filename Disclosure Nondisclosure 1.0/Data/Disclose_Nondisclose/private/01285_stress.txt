I've lately been trying to cope with some serious depression issues. I feel that I'm doing a bit better than usual as of late, but I'm still under high levels of stress. There are a number of things in my life that are causing this. It's to the point my hair is noticeably falling out, and even the slightest comment I don't like is enough to anger me to the point of uncontrollably lashing out. This is always followed by immense regret, which only makes things worse. I suffer from somewhat frequent 'nervous breakdowns' (for lack of a better term?), which consist of, without going into detail, a period in which I'm reduced to a hollow of madness, and every second feels like an unbearable eternity. I wake up every morning is a terribly rotten mood, and it doesn't pass until I've been awake for about three hours.
 Is there anyone here that can offer me some valuable stress reduction advice? I'm assuming the first two things that are going to be mentioned are: diet and exercise. I feel there are no problems with my diet, I never eat any junk food or processed foods. All I really eat are fruits, vegetables and bread products. I never ingest any animals products, strictly vegetarian. Still, I'm sure it could stand to be improved on some levels. As for exercise, I could certainly be getting more, but I get over 60 minutes of exercise daily. Other than that, I'm quite sedentary. Any advice for me?
