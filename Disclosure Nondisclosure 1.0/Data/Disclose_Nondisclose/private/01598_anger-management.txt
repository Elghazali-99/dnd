I am a mother of 3 children, ages 8-18 months. Over the past 2 years There are times when I feel like I cant stand my 2nd child. I have been on different meds for depression over the past 8 years. Recently I have been diagnosed with ADHD. 
I had horrible post partum with him and now i feel like that has come back; not wanting him. He is different from my first child who is very lovable. My 2nd child can be rude and ignorant at times. He doesnt like to show affection and he will whine and cry over everything. I cant stand it. I have tried several approaches yelling talking questioning and nothing works. 
I hate that i feel this way but this feeling has been more prevalent since my 3rd child. It saddens me so to type this realizing their are women who would give anything to have a child, here i am blessed with 3 healthy beautiful and smart children and i cant tolerate my 2nd one. 
I feel like a horrible mother not worthy of this blessing but how do i cope and deal with these feels of disgust and anger towards him.  I seriously feel as though i hate him. 
 Please help.
