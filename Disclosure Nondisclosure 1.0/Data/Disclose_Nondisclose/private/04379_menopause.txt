Hi, this is my first post! I have had symptoms since January, gone to multiple specialist and still no diagnosis. It is so frustrating! A little background first. About a year ago I had my thyroid removed due to questionable cells and difficulty swallowing. I had been on synthroid for 8 years. Four months ago, I had 2 syncopal episodes, and started having dizziness, HA, crazy flushing constantly, heart palpatations with minimal exertion,  shortness of breath, weakness, shaky, slight chest pain on occasion, mind foggy & changes in bowel habits, After several doctors and test and no diagnosis I started researching and it sounded like I may have had vegus nerve damage from thyroid surgery. I got a referral to Vanderbuilt Neurology because they have an autonomic center. Yesterday I had a second tilt table (a cardiologist did the first one in Jan. - Normal) and the second one was normal, as well as the valsalva and deep breathing test.  After follow up with my neurologist, he suggested no answers, prescribed propranolol to regulate my heart rate and recommended we repeat the testing again in 6 mos. Maybe this is related to my thyroid medication, I just don't know ( the endocrinologist at Vandy said everything looked good) or maybe it's a case of Menopause from hell ( my period stopped in Oct.)! I am at my wits end, I have had to quit working & I can't even pick up my 18 month old grandson for near syncopal episodes. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.
