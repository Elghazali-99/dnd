I have a stepson who has to stay with us due to his parole. He is in his late 20's and has alot of issues. First off he is married, his wife and son live in a different state. He has a severe drinking problem and has no willingness to better himself. When I met my now husband, his son was in jail. I met him when he got out about a year later. He only uses his father for a place to stay. He leaves dirty dishes in the sink, his room smells,he drinks way to much and he walks around as if to say this is my father's house not yours. I said no alcohol in the house, so he has his father take him to go get it and bring it in. losing battle, so I said ok only a six pack. But no that's not good enough, Now it's 2 six packs and whiskey. Now that isn't good enough either, now it's everyday. My husband gets mad at me but says he feels the same way. If we tell him to get out he will be back in jail. My stepson's reply is I have a job,What I can't have a beer? One beer is not the problem, it's the 5-12 beers after that. My husband said I put up with your son for 4 years and did not say anything. Yes, that's true but he is a good kid (now on his own). Not one minutes trouble with alcohol,drugs,girls and no trouble with the law ( I really lucked out). I am at my wits end. My husband and I have not talked in 2 days, and I want to fly solo. You may think I am wrong but, I don't love anyone enough to go through this hell.
