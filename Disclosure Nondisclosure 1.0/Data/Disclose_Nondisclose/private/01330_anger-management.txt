I have a fiance and a son. I have serious anger issues, and flip out over anything and everything, even when there is no reason to be mad. I literally feel like all I do anymore is yell/flip out, or am constantly pissed off. I don't leave my house much, literally sit on my *** all day, and wish I wasn't like this anymore. I don't even clean now. I never use to be like this until I got pregnant. Once my son came I got postpartum hyperthyroidism but they killed my thyroid with radio active iodine. I don't know if that has anything to do with my mental issues. All I know is that I have always been an angry person since I can remember, but my flipping out these days is worse than ever before. I have gone to counseling many different times, and I have to say it never helped even though I really tried and was truthful with them. I'm scared I'm going to lose my family! I love my son and fiance more than anything and need to stop this anger. I really don't know what to do anymore, but know that if I don't change, I will lose the people who I love the most. What do I do? How do I stop!
