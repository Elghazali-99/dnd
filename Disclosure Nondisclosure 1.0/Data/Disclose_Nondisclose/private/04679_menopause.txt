I've been "post-menopausal" based on blood test results for two years. I had one light period 18 months ago, and last February and March I had two "periods" that were just a few days of brown spotting. Since then, nothing. I experience feeling absolutely horrible -- symptoms come and go but when they come they last for months at a time. The most disconcerting are balance issues, and very weak legs. I have a hard time just standing up long enough to make dinner. Legs also feel like they vibrate at night. I had hot flashes during the fall but for the last few weeks, those are gone. Still feel awful, though. All my blood tests are normal. I had a brain MRI two years ago and I really don't want to have one again. I did have parathyroid surgery two years ago but I'm supposedly "cured" of that and all those levels are normal. My thyroid levels are normal, too. Doctors chock it all up to "the change." For those who've actually gone through menopause, does this sound familiar? Thanks for the support, Missy
