What i have to say is similar to basically everyone on here and it makes me even more depressed to think that i am the same as many others... I am 14 in year 9, i havent been to school for 3 months and i have been diagnosed with depression. I am taking medication for it.. At 14! But it doesnt even help. I see a psychiatrist every week but i have no self esteem and open up to nobody so i hate going there weekly judt to sit in silence so i dont think the psychiatrist even helps either. I stay at home everyday in my room either sleeping most of the day so that i dont have to endure it or i just sit and listen to the music i love... My parents yell at me everyday and try to drag me out of bed and drive me to school but all that happens is i run away and sit on the street somewhere crying judt to get away from them. Noone seems to understand how sht i feel. For a while i had a bf who i thought i loved and i judt texted him all day talking about everything with him but then he left me and i tried to kill myself.. I was going to hand myself on my door but i couldnt -_- i dont know why i cant but i wish so much that i could just not have to deal with it all somehow and the only way i can think of is suicide. I cut myself for a week but my mum found out and cried... So i felt sorry for her and stopped. I used to have friends but since i stopped going out i stopped seeing them so im too scared to talk to them because i dont think they will know me anymore. Im new on this site and i dont know what will happen to this but im just thankful to tell someone how i feel about everything..
