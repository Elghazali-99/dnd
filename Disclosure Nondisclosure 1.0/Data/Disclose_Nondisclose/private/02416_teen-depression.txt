What  I supposto do. I have been extremly Dow. For the last year exactly and I am talking to my youth pastor a pastor and my pastor knows about it. But the thing is I want profeshanal help. But I can't tell my Mum or stepdad. My stepdad would just say there's that poor me syndrome
again. So I am thinking mabey I should move to live with my Dad and stepmom because I think can tell my step mom because she is so understanding. But I don't want to leave the people I'm already getting help from behind. It's not like I would be able to just go for a short walk to talk to them because if I move to my Dads I move across the country again. I don't want to tell my Mum because every other time I tell my Mum about somhing seriouse she just over looks it and acts like it's nothing. And it's not nothing. Like I told her anout standing up to fast and fainting. And she was like ok. I tolde her it hurt to breath she said ok. That's it. That's all she says. I want and need profeshanal help but if I saty here I can't and won't get it. But if I move I'll have to leave all the progress I've made here behind. Plus school is alot harder there and I already strugle here. And I don't want to leave my youth pastor behind because she is like a Mom to me. Here's a description of how I've been feeling so you can understand..............................................
Ever since a year ago today august 15th last year when my step brother was hit by a truck and killed I have not been my self. I started hating my self and body. It started out slow but then progessed really really fast. I have tryed to kill my self twice in the lhalf a year and wanted to many other times. And almost did 2 other times. I have a deep hatred for my self and I can't stand myself. I feel that people would be much happeir if I were to just die because I wouldent be here to cause so much trouble or to annoy them so much....................... So what do I do. Move or stay put???
