I'm a thirteen year old girl and I've been having rough times with myself lately. There's been periods of time (2+ weeks) where I feel like I'm on top of the world, euphoric, more social than usual, super happy, I laugh at everything, I get hot-headed, get little sleep and wake up full of energy, etc, and I usually feel the need to talk forever. Then there's periods of time (2+ weeks) where I feel like ****, don't want to get up, I'm always tired, I don't wanna speak at all, I feel like a failure, have suicidal thoughs, cry for no reason, don't wanna do anything etc. This last two months have been a ******* mess and I stopped doing two of the things that I really liked doing, and it also feels like i don't have enthusiasm about anything anymore. 
I feel like nobody cares about me. 
I feel like the world would be ******* good without me.
I also realized not so long ago that I've been having suicidal thoughs since ten.
So many people say this is normal (puberty, teenage years, etc) but I'm pretty sure it's not.
 Am I depressed? Do I have bipolar disorder? Or I'm just overreacting?
Thanks.
