Well,  my situation is severe refracted depression.
 Initially tried the combination Fluxoteine and Olanzapine.
No good.
 Tried Lexapro - minimal effect.
 Mirtazipine - good effect, but not sufficient.
 Doc started me on a combo of that with Effexor.
Currently 75mg, working my way up to 150, and potentially higher.
 But even at 75 now, I mean, I experienced some sexual dysfunction on Lex, but not remotely this bad.
 It's like, I don't think I'll ever be able to have sex again.
The only way I can finish is by like, an hour of intense jerking (excuse me), whilst looking at a variety of pornography - this is even when I'm with a woman.
Woman alone does not cut it.
Need seriously hot porno - again, pardon my explicitness.
 When the dose goes up, I mean, what am I to do??
 So - I've been researching and, I believe my options - as SSRI's are gone - are, Cymbalta.
I've heard mixed reviews; doesn't seem to be as effective as effexor.
 Tri-cyclics and MAOI's - which my doc refuses to prescribe.
 Then there's Valdoxan.
Which seems to be the last direct port of call.
 Other anti-psychotics like Lyrica, but, I don't believe they're as effective as straight AD's.
 Is there anything I can do to reduce the sexual dysfunction side effect??
 I've heard Zyban or Welbutrin added to the mix can be beneficial, but I've heard this doesn't work for many people also.
 Suggestions?
