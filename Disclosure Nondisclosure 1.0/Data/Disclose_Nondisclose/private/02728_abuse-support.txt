I'm 32 years old, female. I'm discovering now that I'm suffering from verbal or mental abuse from my mother. Let me explain.
 I was always a pretty successful student; straight A's right into high school. I have 3 Bachelors degrees. I was the type of kid that followed rules. If my parents said be home at 10, I'd be home at 10. I'm not saying I'm perfect, but I did what my parents expected of me.
 The problem arises with my mother who told me such things as, I wish you weren't born, get out of here, it would be better if you weren't here, etc.  I remember this as earyl as 7 years old, when I got a beating.  This is common for my mother to say hurtful things; in fact she never attended my graduations or convocations...she always compares me to other people's children, making me feel that I'm not good enough....
 I've finally realized how much her words have impacted my life.  As an adult, I feel anxiety at times and I just want to get aay from people, I haev lots of fears, that I'm not good enough or worthy.When she says these thins to me, I wish I weren't alive. I wish I could just die and not hear any of her words.  When I was 16, I tried to commit suicide.
 When I was 19, I confronted my mother about how she has hurt me, how she only sees the negative and that her criticisms bother me. I told her that she never tells me she loves me...how much it hurts.  She responded by saying nothing...just giving me a blank stare.
 Most of all, I need to get my life on track. I'm 32 and work online because I feel like hiding from the world. I have a somewhat successful business but I don't find it fulfilling. I need to find a teaching job but the whole idea of searching ofr a job and rejection scares me. I feel immobilized at times....
 But I want to move forward.  I can't live my life being afraid and hiding...when I have so much potential.
 Where do I start? 
 Thanks for reading.
