hello there Doc. i am a son of a 48 years old father we live in Lebanon my dad works as a barber who have been in his job for around 35 years recently my dad started experiencing weird hand shaking while holding his blade or his hair brush his hand starts shaking since 6 months when he raise his elbow up and uses the scissors his hand shake decreases but when his hand is horizontally it shakes then when he twists his palm to the left for example this hand shaking increases, sometimes he feels his forearm like its light and don't belong to his body we have might found that this might be caused from muscle contractions but my dad went to the gym and he trained good and his hands are stable second reason was some sort of stress issues but it didn't seem to be he have visited general majored doctors they gave him the following medicines "Difen b12" "magne b6" "roxonin 60mg" "selektine 7.5" "paraxone" and something am not sure of his name "neuribon" his height is 164 cm and weighs 60kg he always took the Magnesium pills 250mg to get relaxed. so doc that was everything i knew and i really wana help dad because i do love him and he is the supporter of the family so i really hope to get what it needs to cure him.
thanks alot of your time
