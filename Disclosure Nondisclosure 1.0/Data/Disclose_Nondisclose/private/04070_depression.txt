Hello everyone! I usually don't like to discuss my problems with anyone ,even my own family, but I find myself in a dire situation. Starting in about August of this year I started to panic about my future. I had absolutely no goal or even a direction I wanted to take in life. I believed that this was simply a phase and would pass as soon as I went into college as a Liberal Arts student, something I was pressured into doing by my parents. However, it did not go away, but instead got progressively worse. I began to and am still questioning why I am even going to college and the benefits of living in a world that I seem to be an alien in. It has gotten so bad now that the only thing keeping me alive in this world is to think of how sad and depressed my friends and family may feel if I ever decided to take the route. I have lost all will to live. I eat scantly and more unhealthy, am sleeping more, and am thinking constantly about death. I am at a lost on what to do and seek any guidance you have to give me.
