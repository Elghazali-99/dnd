i feel sick after i eat or drink like a really bad stomach ache and also after school ended for the summer for the past week, i sleep til 12 and dont go to bed till 3 and i feel like im asleep like in a dream. and some thing in my stomach fell like im forgetting something. of coures i am reading a book series that is ending and the stomach forgetting thing happend last time  a series ended 
 i mean i have never been clinackly depressed but i can tell my parents are worried about me. cuz all i do is sort of hang around the house im not allowed to eave cuz both my parents work . but for the past 2 weeks all ive done is watch tv and get on the computer. and im usally very active . i feel almost like the world is closing in on me. like its a struggle to breathe.is just boredom or am i ill
 also i was diagnosed with exersise endused sydrome while passing out on the basketball court because i couldnt breathe during b-bal season. does that have something to do with my trouble breathing 
 whats wrong with me? am i depressed. am I ill? what do i do?
