Hi everyone,
I'm a teenager in high school and my depression has reached a point of becoming unbearable. I've known about it for a few months, but its always seemed manageable on my own. Now, its come to a point where I am extremely tired all the time and cannot function as I should be able to. I honestly would rather be asleep than awake. I am unhappy or empty all the time and I seem to over eat to compensate for my lack of happiness. My relationships with everyone have become strained and I rarely go out with friends anymore and I choose to stay in my room all day than spend time with my family. I've seriously considered running away a number of times because I feel like I would be happier somewhere other than here. I've never self-harmed but I think about it a lot. 
 I've never seen a doctor about this because I guess I'm scared to tell others about it. Even posting about it on here was hard for me to do. My friends and family don't know about it because it seems impossible to talk about it with them. I guess they either don't notice I act this way or don't care. 
 I guess my question is what should I do from here? Making hard decisions is on my list of impossible things too. Would it be completely irrational to run away? Should I go see a doctor? By myself? Should I tell my parents? If so, how? Would the doctors make me take pills? I'm already very paranoid and not sure how I feel about it.
 I would really appreciate it if someone who went through something similar or has past experience could share some advice.
