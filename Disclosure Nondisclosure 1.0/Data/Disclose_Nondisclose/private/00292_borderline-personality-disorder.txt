My 15 year old daughter Is what I believe a really huge risk factor I am scared of my daughter. She is very violent and gory and If she gets Introuble with other kids she won't stop fighting till she see's blood. But on the other hand she can be sweet loving and happy. Her mood changes alot I'd say Her mood changes 38 times In a day and when she turns personality she will hit scratch and bite. She doesn't like a particular girl she's been holding a grudge against her for 2 years. 
 Her teachers have told me she can work well one day and she won't work hard the next day she'll be disruptive and say horrible violent stuff. I spoke to her one night, she said she feels things on her body like a million small bugs on her and if so somebody was touching her arm back or leg, she says she has scary thoughts, thoughts that can over power her. She feels very paranoid and she says her thoughts go crazy like really fast. She feels that everybody knows about her and there going to get her.
 Sometimes she feels like she Is In a movie or people are making a t.v show based on her with her everyday life she feels constantly watched and laughed at. 
 Sometimes she will think she has special powers like spiderman or a character she likes to call herself who is stretcher girl.
 She finds it difficult to stay with her friends for a certain amount of time like she has to seperate from them and sit by her self In a corner or somewhere quiet or dark.
 Please somebody what is her suffering? And will she need long term hospitalization? 
 Thanks.
