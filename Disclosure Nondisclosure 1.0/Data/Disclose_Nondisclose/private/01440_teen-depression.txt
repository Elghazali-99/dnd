lately i've been upset, i cry myself to sleep almost every night. I'm  scared and i feel pain. A  few months ago i broke up with my bf because i felt i need more space. I recently just entered college and its my 2nd semester. i'm having trouble  trying to do hwrk, and  i have this new guy that has become obsessed with me and it stresses me out that  he wont understand that i don't want to go out with him. He's a sweet nice guy but he's extremely clingy and buys me stuff. I hate it, and i absolutely can't stand it.The fact that everyone is pushing me to date him, doesn't help either.  I would go to my friends for help but they have their own ideas. i feel like everyday is a play and i have to act just to get by. My parents care but they don't see the real me, because i've  exiled them from knowing anything about me. I tried telling them i need to see a psychologist, but they just blow it off as if its nothing. But now i can't take anything anymore, all my professors at school pile me with hwrk, i'm only taking 15 credits and i have 1 job and i only work weekends. I don't know what to do, i'm hoping that someone will hear me out cause i know when i get depressed it hits me hard. I've had it ever since 5th grade but i usually got over it, but now idk how to deal with it because its at a whole other  level. everything feels too much. in case u want to know i'm 18
