I have a 5 year old girl who was playing on the playground with her class and the other pre-k class.  Another 5 year old boy was getting her and other children to play 'family' with him ( He was sticking his hands down her pants under her underwear) He has flashed other children and told them to touch him and has even been sticking his hands up little boys butts.  When my 5 year old told me I immediately called the teacher's aid to let her know and was shocked to find out that there was already another child who had been a victim and she would now ' watch' him better.  I directly went to the principle of the school and she is trying to cover it up.  The child is in counseling but still gets to play on the playground.  He has done this and other inappropriate things to his other classmates.  We have called cps and have a lawyer but when I talked to the principle she just says that if anyone causes trouble she can expell us.  I really don't care about going there anymore so her she can threaten me all she wants.  I mentioned getting more teachers or aid to be on the playground since two obviously are not enough ( especially when they don't watch them) but she said it wasnt in the budget.  I feel that the safety of my children are not in her budget.  She doesn't want all the victims parents to talk to each other and said we are not allowed to contact any other parent of the pre-k class to tell them about this.  I am going in front of the school board on Jan 8th to talk about this and possibly knocking down a wooden playhouse and other wooden area that the children are being able to hide behind.  If anyone has any good suggestions to tell the school board please respond.  I could use all the help there is. Thank you
