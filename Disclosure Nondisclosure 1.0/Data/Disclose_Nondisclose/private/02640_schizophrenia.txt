I think my mom has schizophrenia but I would appreciate any advice. She has been thinking that people are living in her attic and they talk to her thru the vents. She is so obcessed with this and tells anyone that will listen. She calls the police regurally and is scared to leave the house. This has become a BIG problem b/c my dad was just diagnoised with inoperateable cancer and she is of no help to him and refuses to go to the drs.
Also, she is on all types of medication and some are very addictive and I feel she abuses them. She has always had depression but never was delusional until about 3 months ago. The delusions have goteen worse. She worries nonstop and is paranoid all the time. She talks to these people she thinks are living in her attic and tells them she is going to kill them.
I have tried to get her to go to her dr and tell him this and I told her I was going to take her, she got so angry with me and told me I was not going with her and I was not going to make him think she was crazy. She truly believes all this and I am at my wits end. I don't know how to get her help when she is in denial and feels she does not need medical intervention. On top of this i am taking care of my Dad who is slowly dying......please help me help my Mom who I love very much.
Thanks in advance for any advice.
