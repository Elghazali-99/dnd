Hi i will begin be describing my situation and then ask. I am 20 years old. i have paranoia, in my paranoia i feel i constantly lose control of my self and begin speaking what am thinking outloud, usually when an embarassing thought occurs but really with anything. then i hear "voices" of the people around me talking about me. usually i think they see me talking to my self and begin to comment or laugh about it. this happens constantly i cant be in public settings any more because of this. i used to be very social loved talking to people i am now reclusive and awkward. like i dont know what to say anymore. Point B. i also am constantly replaying embarassing scenarios about my self in my head and am constantly or having conversations with my self about it or about subjects relating to this. cant seem to stop constantly i watch tv always now because it helps me stop. all i think about is basically conversations with my self and embarassing scenarios ans stuff its weird i wasnt always like this how do i make it stop?
