Ok, well to start off  i'm 18 years old and a freshman in college. but i'm not happy, nor can I pretend to be happy. My parents pressure me everyday, and make comments about my appearance. yes I am overweight, and I'm aware of it. but the more they notice it, I just hide behind my baggy clothes. Not only do my parents make comments, but some friends of mine too. I just laugh along with them, but inside I dying. I work so hard to prove to people I can be something but no matter what I'm always pushed aside like a bag of garbage. I want to show people I can be something, but I can't even be myself right now. I used to be a joyful, loving and caring girl. But right now, I hate everyone, I have bad mood swings and I want to disappear, and i've had suicide cross my mind more often, in fact its kinda my thought all day long. I want to be happy again, I want to have fun with my friends, I want my mom to be happy with me again. The last time she truly seemed happy with was when I lost 65lbs. But little did she know, I starved myself, made myself sick, lost lots of firends. and harmed myself. but she loved it. buying me smaller clothes, and loved the fact i fit into medium shirts. after I was turned around by a close friend of mine, i ended up gaining the weight back, plus some. I think I'm suffering from depression, but I can't tell my parents they think i'm kidding. and my doctor is a family friend. I need help. PLEASE.
