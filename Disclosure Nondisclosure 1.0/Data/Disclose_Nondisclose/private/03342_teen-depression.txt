Hi everyone. I am 17 years old , and I am a boy. I have been in this awkward phase of mine for about 2 years.. I remember when it all started.I was a surprisingly good looking, 14 year old kid . I had really nice hair and every girl loved it, I got complimented on it everyday. I was in my science class in the 9th grade when I was 15, and began to notice that my My hair got curly and Dry as hell, not even conditioner helps it. Then I started getting acne shortly.
Now I'm a 17 year old , 5 foot 10 inches , 125 pound Awkward *** looking kid.
 WHAT HAPPENED!?
Its to the point where I can't stand being a teenager. I just want to be out this awkward phase for good! I hate it , I hate it. Then I see these other boys. They look like teen models , and here I am , being eaten alive by the horrors of puberty. Why me ? I was such a cute kid everyone tells me . How come there are kids that don't have to worry about pimples , or awkwardness , meanwhile I have to worry about how I look when I hug someone , or how I speak , or what I look like when I smile.
 My confidence is the thinnest thread in the world right now. My mom tells me that my acne isn't that bad. Sure , its not horrible , but when you put my face underneath it , its twice as bad! And I hate comparing pictures of me now , to pictures from 2 years ago . You would never know that it was the same person.
 I barely speak to anyone at family parties because my aunts , uncles , and cousins have seen me when I was better looking.
 I am self consious of every little thing I do.
I go to hug someone " you probably looked awkward"
I'm talking " make sure you don't spit while you talk! "
I laugh " try not to let your teeth show"
Some gives me a weird look " they probably think I am the most hideous human alive"
 I HATE IT! It never used to be this way. I was fine . Emotionally , physically , personality wise everything was perfect. Now , its as if I am living a second life.
