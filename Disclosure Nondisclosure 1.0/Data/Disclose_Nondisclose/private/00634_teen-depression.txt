My boyfriend and i broke up a few months ago. But lately we have been talking about getting back together. ( we were together for 2 years) Im pregnant and he has ben playing games like.. one day im the most important thing in his life. then next im... "devalued" to the point where he ignores me and acts like im a bad person. The other day i went to the hospital to make sure my baby was ok and RIGHT afterward i went over to his house and just walked in. he was sitting there on the couch with some girl. they werent doing anything but the tv was off and they were sitting really close. so of course i freaked out. we talked and he told me that he kissed her 3 weeks ago which was right when we started talking about getting back together and hanging out and stuff. so obviously he isnt ready to be with me even though he acts soo emotional when im not around. and when i cant talk to him he gets sooo upset and blows up my phone. then when he has other people around im not so important anyone and it turns into me blowing up his phone. So i was surfing the web and of course i am not a doctor but i found an article on BPD ( borderline personality disorder) and the symptoms, the reason that the disorder usually arises, everything.. matches. it says in there that one day they idolize the person and the next they become devalued. So my question is.. there is no way i can tell him to go get counciling because ive already tried to tell him to but he doesnt think he needs help, i changed my number and im trying to decide if i should stand by him or if i should just leave? im pregnant and this emotional roller coaster cant be healthy for me or my baby but at the same time i love him. im soo confused. what should i do? i cant handle this constant radical behavior but when im not around him.. i feel so alone.
What should i do?
