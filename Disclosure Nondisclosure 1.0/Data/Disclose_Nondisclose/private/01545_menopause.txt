Hi Ladies... Well I have read a lot of the posts and we are all in the same boat BUT I didn't ready any
solutions!!! :(((( I have been in pre-menopause for 4-5years. I have gained 30 pounds sadly and it can
still climb!! I am dieting and even exercising like never before and NOTHING!! I have not lost 1 pound!!!
It is very depressing!!!! I see the posts date back to years ago... Has anyone found a solution.. does this
eventually stop??? I have a closet full of clothes that I cannot wear but I don't want to throw them away!!
I also do NOT want to go clothes shopping... so, what to do,, what to do??? Right now I am doing Nutrisystem
just so I don't gain anymore weight eating regular food!!! It is very embarrassing to be this way and yet.. 
I can't do a darn thing about it!!!! It's crazy!!!!! Sadly spring is finally here and I don't even want to go outside!!
I have never heard of something like this and it is nice to see that I am not alone!!!! 
I had blood work done and it is not my thyroids!!! Oh, I have been on Amberen and it doesn't seem to be helping! :(
So.. if anyone has any answers or advice.. PLEASE HELLPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!
