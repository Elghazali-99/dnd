My soon to be ex-husband has always had a problem with our 14 year old daughter. She could never do anything right in his eyes. He complained daily that she was lazy, spoiled, a brat, disrespectful, selfish ect. He complained she was on the computer or in front of a t.v. or her room was a mess.
He worked till 7-8 at night and never saw her help with her younger brothers, do her homework, set the table for dinner or do her own laundry. She is a straight "A" student and I have very little problems with her(I finally realized if you shut the door to her room the mess is gone)ha ha
She was forced into therapy by a parenting time coordinator for Oakland county court, because of her dislike for her father. She is having trouble expressing herself because she has pretty much given up from no one listening. She says she doesn't want to spend time with him and I say why not? She says I told everyone and let it go and I feel better but they did not hear me. I know why but they don't hear me either. I guess the real question is how can a therapist know how emotionally/verbally abused someone has been?  There are no visual scars or bruises. She does not have to like him or want to be with him. I have told her to write down her feelings and memories so she can read them to the therapist but she has not.
She is forced to be with him from 6pm to 8pm, two nights a week and he continues his verbal abuse but she tells me and not the therapist. Just tonight, he told her she needs to talk to him and to stop being a little ****. How can a man speak to his daughter like this and think she is going to respect him or want to be with him? When she ordered her small pizza instead of a personal he said are you going to eat all that or are you just trying to waste money. Then when she got a doggy bag for one piece of pizza he took it from her before she got out of the car.
