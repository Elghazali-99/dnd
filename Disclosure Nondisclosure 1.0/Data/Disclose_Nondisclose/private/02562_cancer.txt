My brother was diagnosed with colon cancer 1 and a half yrs  ago. Unfortunately it spread to his lungs and liver . The Dr were able to get rid of the colon cancer but he is in stage 4 with lung and liver cancer and has been for at least six months or longer. Before cancer, my Brother was so healthy and lived such a healthy life style. He was a expert scuba diver, golfer, worked out, and was in involved with ride for site and different motorcycle events. He worked at a pulp mill for 20 years (paper mill) Then he worked at a nucular plant for the last5 just before diagnoses.  I have researched and researched to find somebody who beat liver cancer at stage 4, and can't find anybody. Has anyone know someone or themselves able to beat liver cancer at this stage and if so what did you do? Chemo and rad. is not working and hasn't been for some time. His time is running out. He has been told he is doing tremendous for somebody in his condition. I believe in miracles and would love to hear about some
