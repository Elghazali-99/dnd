This is a chaotic story!!!  Ok, I ran into an old friend of the family about 2 years ago on Facebook and He said he had been diagnosed with BPD and that his wife had cheated on him and that he was seperated and getting a divorce. Ive known him since we were kids and he was my brothers best friend. Anyway, e started this emotional affair on Facebook, which I fell in love with him, and him with me, and we both desided to move back to our home town and start over together, i seperated from my spouse, and away we went back to our home town to set up a new life. Weve knon eachother since we were kids so I totally trusted him, asnd didnt really know to much about BPD and was very ignorant to this disorder. We spent 15 days together in total bliss to see if it would work out between us, but he desided he needed to go back to say goodbye to his kids, get all his stuff and come back. I got really paranoid that he was going to not come back to me, he had asked me to go back to Oaklahoma with him, but because I was going to be in a custody case, i couldnt leave, I would loose custody of my kids, so we agreed he would go back get his stuff, say goodbye to his kids, then we could arrange all the other things that go along with kids and divorce together, he told me kids are resiliant and that they all would be fine. He goes back to his wife and kids and I had a really bad feeling that he was cheating on me with his soon to be ex wife, well he was! So I broke up with him out of anger and hurt, adn then he told me he couldnt leave his kids and hasnt spoken to me since, he has recently got back with his wife, which they had been separated for 3 years, and hasnt spoken to me, I know this situation sounds crazy so please dont put any harsh comment, I was ignorant to his BPD disorder and want to know hat to do, how do I restore our friendship?
