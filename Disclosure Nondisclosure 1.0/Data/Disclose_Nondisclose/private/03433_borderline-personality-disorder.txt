Has anyone been diagnosed at 28??  I lived my whole life with depression and some outbursts but in the last year and a half I have completely changed.  I got addicted to Percocet last year, after having the gastric bypass and my first boyfriend.  I was waiting until marriage to loose my virginity which I lost last year after meeting my ex.  Since then I have been percocet free for 8 months atleast but other horrible lifestyle changes have come into play.  I've become a pathological liar, I've started smoking cigarettes (I quit marijuana) which I lie to everyone about.  Since the weight loss I've been recognized by men for the first time and I ended up lying to my mother about going to a torah lecture and having sex with some guy I've only met 3 or 4 times and getting pregnant.  I ended up having to have an abortion at over 2 months of pregnancy (the worst day of my life).
 I cannot seem to stop. A therapist and myself diagnosed me with BPD and we have begun Dialectal Therapy, although we havent even begun the therapy because every week seems to bring another big, tremendous fight with my family and weve discussed that.
 I feel like I cant stop searching for a high, escape or lying.  I've completely lost my relationship with  my family.  I'm on cymbalta and abilify.  Also klonopin for anxiety and adderall for ADD but nothing seems to be helping.
 As a matter of fact, last weekend I had sex with one of my employees which led to my mother having to fire him (btw I live and work with my mother and sister too).  Im completely lost and exhausted. 
 I just needed to vent all of this and know if there is anyone that has lost themselves this late in life.  Was it my weight all my life hiding this BPD?? And now it chooses to come out?? or is it something worse...
 Does BPD get worse?????
