This adult has all of these disorders rolled in to one. How does someone have so many disorders? These disorders have been consistent since early childhood developed between 5-10 yrs old. This person is halfway aware of the multiple disorders but refuses to want change or help, even strongly seems to indicate this person admires their disorders because they feel empowered by them.
 Can anyone offer suggestions how this happened? No drugs were or are involved.
 Only thing that I know is that the persons father may have been angry-aggressive to this persons mother. There is no indication this person was ever touched by family members in any way. I believe this persons father was controlling to the family. Other than that they seem to be a close family with brothers and sisters. This persons identical twin does not show all these disorders. Twin however does suffer from alcohol addiction but does not show any other personality disorders. There is evidence of family alcohol addiction. But I've seen many families with alcohol problems and none that produced so many acute personality disorders. Could there be another reason to explain all these disorders? As a child this person was loved not rejected by parents. Can a difficult child hood do all this?
