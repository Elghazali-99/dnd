Hello! I am here to ask afew questions regarding changes in poop consistency, is a  something serious?at first I pooped hard small pellets liked and I was worried about my stools so I tried to use something to checked on my stools whether there were blood in it, so when I did that the toilet bowl water changes to dark red or something, I suspect there is blood hidden inside my stools, I checked for symptoms like this it jus mention CANCER. I am only 16 with no records of bowel/anal/colon cancer! I am a vegan as well, I really had this changing type of bm! And later I was worried so I poop again( I felt like pooping as well) so I did not hesitate and went to do my bm, I saw that my stool was floating very soft thr I used something again to check and it break up into pieaces ! I remembered my first stool sank. Lol what is wrong?! And yes, my bm looked dark for e second time, alright, this is happening abnormally . Blood ? I really dk! I asked my mom she said its jus something small I wanted to show her and I was really scared at that point I only could share this here and hope doctor would give me an helping answer by not scaring me to do anything! I don't want to die early! I have lots of things that are not done yet! I am like crying now I don't want to see a doc but I need to !:(
