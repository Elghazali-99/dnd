My brother has never been diagnosed with schizophrenia however my siblings have been aware that his behavior for the last 25 years indicates some kind of mental problem. He is 47 and lives with my mother who is regularly visited by a social worker. She has dementia and we will be initiating a court order soon to have her declared our ward, which will mean that both of them will have to move out of the decrepit house that they are in. The social worker concurs with our assessment of my brother.
 At the schizophrenia support group for families meeting this week, a woman stated that her son used the positprogram and has improved tremendously. It is an interactive program that records the users actions and adjusts it's questions to the user accordingly, with the goal to achieve a positive neuroplasticity change.
On their site they dispute a BBC study that says this type of program cannot cause an improvement. Does anyone know anything about this program, as I would buy it for him if there is any hope for an improvement?
