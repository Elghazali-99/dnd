My boyfriend had become social self destructive emotionally unstable, paranoid from multiple recent concussions. Despite normal mri and eeg results. the eeg however shows some emotional instability from non neurological related but more psychological.   He was codependent but now he has become extremely possessive and obsessed with me. He is extremely paranoid haunted by childhood pain and relationship deception and harping on even trivial lies in addition to distorted thoughts and recently he has been experiencing auditory hallucinations. He is self destructive and suicidal and cannot handle demands and stress as it has resulted in new self inflicted concussions. whatever the case is that he needs desperate medical attention. In addition already lives a life of chronic physical pain. Publically he can appear normal emotionally stable and  cognitively functional but internally I fear he may be losing his mind. He refuses to go to see a therapist so I fear I may need to resort to forcing him for mental help involuntarily and must be restrained from further self infliction. he has so much darkness inside him that he fears he may be spiritually attacked.
