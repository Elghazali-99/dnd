Ive been struggling on now for 2 years following the discovery of my husbands first affair which last 18 months and I'm still really struggling.  What makes it worse is I discovered a previous affair only last December, which also lasted approx. 18 months.  So basically I know he's been living in a fantasy world for at least 3 years of our marriage (2007-2010) and I'm devasted.  
 he's been open about it all, tho not completely honest (I think he thinks he's protecting me by not telling me everything) but I fear there were others.  He's done a 360 in terms of how he is as a father and husband but I still have awful days not knowing if staying is the right thing to do.  I'm beginning to think I'm abnormal because I can't get past it.
 We've been together 20 years, married for 14 and have two children 11&9.  I get frustrated with people saying move on and let go.... HOW DO YOU DO THAT???  If there was something I could do to turn off these dreadful feelings I would, but I don't know how.  I wanted to go for professional therapy, he's against it, probably because it's going to be quite uncomfortable for him. 
 I'm just in limbo not knowing what to do.
 Any advice?
