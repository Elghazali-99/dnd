I've seen multiple MD's over the last 19+ years, and wonder what I can do about my diagnosed personality disorder - NOS!  Nothing helps!!  I've lost every job since age 22, and I have poor skills at predicting good matches with employers and careers!  
I've NEVER been in a long-term relationship, held a job very long, enjoyed myself in any main life sphere, and I've lost friendships, relationships and family members' affection!  I'm treated as persona-non-grata by my brother's family and simply have no faith in mental health fx. as I've made little progress in therapy over the years!  
I'm also Bipolar-1 and suffer from diabetes-1, sleep apnea and cannot move fwd with my life!  
I used to be independent, but now have lived with my mother for 3 1/2 years at age 47!!
My sense of self is in the toilet and my career as a QMHP is shattered!!  
Perhaps you know of a program the V.A. has for intensive outpx that may be of help to more "advanced" and well-educated people who can't tolerate substance abusers and uneducated, unmotivated jack-***** the VA tends to attract?
