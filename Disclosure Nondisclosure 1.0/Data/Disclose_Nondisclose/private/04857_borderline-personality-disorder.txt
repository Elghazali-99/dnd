The problem is that no matter how hard and how many hours I work my boss wants more and more and more from me.  After 13 years I finally said I could do no more and his answer was to give me 5 more hours work a day that he transferred from another department.  If I do what he wants done I will work 12-16 hour days and get no time at home. Oh of course there is no overtime paid.   
 My husband wants me to keep the job for the money.  Is the money worth more than me????  He wants me to get out of the house and socialize.  I do not want to see anyone or talk to anyone.  I want to hybernate.   
 I have shut down, crying all the time, nightmares, not sleeping and no one to talk to that would understand.  I am lost.   I do not think I am stupid I am just worn out from all the stress.  
 So what am I gonna do?  I read all the internet self help sites and they say do something positive so I am looking for another job thinking this guy will fire me anytime now.   I am going to Walmart and paying a couple of bucks and will dye my hair.  Put on some makeup and see if that helps even if it is just for a few minutes.  Anything is better than sitting here crying.   
 I just started looking for a new job 2 days ago.  Nothing in the newspaper at all so I went to career builder.com and monster.com and they gave me some good leads.  I applied for some of them.  The only thing I know is that I have to feel better or no one will hire me.   
 So I'm gonna take some of the baby steps I found on the internet.  I have to get better, I have children, grandchildren and a great grand daughter on the way.  I absolutely must get back on track.  My problem right now is that I feel there is a freight train on the track and it is heading my way.   
 I did not know I had that much to say but somehow if feels good to write it down.
