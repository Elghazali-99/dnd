I am tired of maintaining mental health. It's been really long I am going smooth except small ups and down. Today something odd happen at work, I felt little bit extra stress. I started to live at suburb, I used to live at city. Mental illness is really really odd. When i used to live near hospital my body used to move. whole bed used to move automatically. When i used to stay at city i got stress. When i live at suburb I got no stress. But my work is at city so there i get little bit stress. When i used to have night job i used to communicate plus stress. Some place i can work very fast, some place slow. Just few minutes ago I sleep and doing brain exercise think lots of rubbishes . Whenever i type something on this forum, I get stress. odd. But I get stress by writing on this form doesn't  mean i give up. Cause I may need to go psycho time after time. life is going smooth hopefully something probably going wrong in my mind. I really don't have any idea am i actually fine or sick? Because this is such an opposite disease where fine could be sick and sick could be fine cause i was extremely fine when i was in my country then. But  i am in high dose now, is that the reason i am getting less psycho or still i need to be psycho whatever main thing is being psycho. I think i need lots of psycho. I checked my weight it's still 86 kg. How to check mental health? Tired of superman life. mental illness has sh***h million symptoms, million cause and effect, I have already experience 100 thousand cause and effects odd things. even doctor cannot answer all the questions, i just need to know am i fine or sick?
