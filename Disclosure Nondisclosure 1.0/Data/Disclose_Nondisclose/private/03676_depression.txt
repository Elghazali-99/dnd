Okay, ever since I was little maybe 3rd grade, I have had serious intense day dreams. It would mostly be with music, of me dreaming of singing and being famous. Or being a famous dancer and I would memorize dance routines and then imagine myself doing it. Or recently being a cheerleader and came up with a whole routine to a song. Or being a comedian and imagine myself doing a comedy act to bo burnam. I don't know why I have always done this, like I'm not happy with myself. And I can't go a day without listening to music and imagining this life that I will never have. I usually feel the need to after I go on Instagram or look at snapchat stories. I don't know if it's normal or not. And sometimes I dream of horrible things. Like me getting cancer or my mom getting into a car wreck. That would be usually when I'm in the shower, and after a while I just start crying and scare myself. I have never told anyone about my weird imaginations, I always thought they would freak people out. Like "yeah I imagine that sometimes I wrote the song bad blood and that I'm that famous and make my own music videos in my head that are so vivid. And that I go to interviews where I talk to Ellen about my life." It just seems so weird but necessary in my life. I also imagine listening to music with friends or partying, it all depends on the mood I'm in. Or having a full on conversation with someone, I can imagine every word that me and someone else would say. Every movement. If I'm ever alone or walking somewhere I'm thinking of some scenario in my head. I'm never just living. I've even imagined talking to someone about this problem. I just don't understand. I don't think it's normal to feel the need to listen to music and pretend to be something I'm clearly not, or to dream of things that I could do while I sit in my empty room and do nothing. And I don't know if other people think about these things because I've never ever told anyone about this. What's wrong with me?
