My name is Hani, 14 years old girl in Indonesia. First of all, sorry if my English is bad, but I think you can understand..
It's been 2 years I've been in junior highschool. Last year I started to think that I changed. I started to feel that everything is too hard, but why other people didn't look like they're working hard like I do? My body became weak, it's easier to catch a cold or fever.. I always feel lazy and it always feels like I don't have any power to do housejobs.. I have a will to do those works but I feel like I can't do it..
I never feel that way before, my body was fit and I never feel sad or desperate with no reason before those things that I felt.. I always have a negative thinking in my mind, I think I stopped making friendship, and I lost a lot of confidence I had.. I had no idea what and why these thing happened to me. 
My parents started to angry to me since I started skipping school for a few days.. I've lost my spirit to go to school.. I always feel down everytime my parents insult me that I'm really lazy.. I don't want to blame anyone.. The "error" is in me, and I think I deserve to be blamed..
All these time, the only thing I really did is play with my smartphone and look up anything that I think will entertain myself.. The only things I'm sure about is that I have a will to do something, but looks like my body doesn't allow me.. But, I don't know why.. So I think I should have a consultation with a phsyciatrist..
I hardly ever say something directly to my mother about sonething I want.. So I just say something about Phsyciatrist, but it looks like she doesn't like that kind of idea.. She always say and act like she can handle everything.. But I know with this situation she doesn't even understand me or situation I have.. Everytime I try to become stronger, it always last for days or even hours.. I want someone to understand my feeling and my situation..
Thank you for read this..
