I hope this makes sense. My brain does not function properly all of the time. I get things mixed up when I write or type them.  My concentration level is horrible. So anyway, here is my question:
 How long is it possible to have an early stage of cancer and go without knowing they have it? I mean for instance: Can a person have it for a little over a year and not know they have it or would they probably pass away before it came to a year? Have you ever heard of a person having cancer for over a year or so and then finding out they have it? Another way for me to put it is: Could a person have horrible symptoms for over a year and then the symptoms just add on (more symptoms) as they go and then the doctor says I doubt you have cancer. So they do not test or look for it (even though the person has lots of family members who have a history of cancer) and the doctor does the same blood tests over and over again that have nothing to do with cancer. Well, then a year or a year and half passes and then they come across another doctor and that doctor runs tests and tells the person they have some form of cancer.  Is that possible? Can a person have it that long before finding out or what? 
 I may have repeated myself there. If I did, I want to apologize for that.  As I said, my brain is not that great with concentration and thinking. I have reasons for asking this for myself. I just wondered before I go to this other doctor and ask him to check for it. 
 Thank you ahead of time for any information.
