I am extremely depressed and my suicidal thoughts have been returning rapidly. I'm growing more and more unmotivated to even get out of bed every day to resolve my financial poverty and try to find a way to afford health insurance again. I know I need to get back onto antidepressants and anti anxiety medication, but trying to face the steps towards getting the help seems daunting and not worth the anxiety that over takes me. Every moment I face seems to challenge me and I want to escape. I know I need help but so tired of trying to do everything on my own and not having it be enough. I don't feel like there is anyone to turn to for help, no one has the means to get me out of this. I'm not sure where to turn, and I really want to stop having suicidal thoughts. the thin thread i'm holding on to is not wanting to go down that road again. Is there anywhere that helps with sever depression that is affordable for someone who hardly lives pay check to pay check? or are there any programs that help out people like me who desire the help but cant afford it?
