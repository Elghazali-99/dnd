I am a college student. I am an A student, involved in the community, an RA, a mentor, and I play on two teams. I appear very happy and can make myself appear happy etc. However, I feel like something is wrong, deep inside. I think I am depressed, but I dont know- and can make myself "be okay," but I have been cutting for 4 years now...but I haven't told anyone yet. I have "moods" as my roommate calls them and I am absolutely irrational. during exam week, after working for 3 days straight, I snapped and got very drunk and bought a $900 dollar pair of Chanel pumps (that I have hidden from my parents...along with the stacks of designer jeans that I buy). In just minutes, I am happy, excited,   sad, desperate, suicidal, elated...I can never figure out what I actually feel because in just a few minutes I can be something completely opposite of what I am ... 
I am very tired of this whole process and have been knicknamed "crazy"..."druggie" (I don't drink often, but I drink a lot when i do drink. I also take pills, advils, tylenol pm's in large quantities- instead of taking the dosage, I pour out a small handful... I have been knicknamed: "bipolar" ...and I can make the names not be true- btu i think that something is very wrong with me, because looking at my actions and my inability to say who/what I am is troubling...and exhausting!! 
what should i do now? what's my next step?
I am afraid to go to therapy or to tell anyone about my thoughts (not illustrated in this comment) because I fear that the content and my history of cuttign will send me to the hospital... and I don't want that because I can be somebody who is "ok" in a minute....ahh. help.
