This is really weird and I really dont know how to describe how I am feeling..So im just going to try..And if you have any questions..just ask and I will try my best to answer... 
  I have been feeling like this since I was around 15 or 16..I am now 20. 
I will look at something and wonder If I am in a dream or nightmare. I think maybe i am being punished from a past life. I lay in bed almost everynight and ask god why he lets me think the way I think. 
 Everything is like that. My life, my body, my family, my freinds,my car..everything to the very answers you will be giving me shortly....Its really freakin scary.. 
When something bad i feel has happend or is going to happen to me, I hear in my head scary music witch makes it even more terrifing then it needs to be. 
 There are times when I feel like im in 3rd person...and its creepy as hell 
 To be honest nobody knows this about me. I havant told anybody this..Witch is why I am on Yahoo answers because I am embarresed about this... 
 I will be walking in the park and the world will just look like a pastel painting...Do you know how much that freaks me out when that happens??? 
 Trust me I cry about it...I consider an escape every now and again when it get out of controll. 
I dont hear voices or anything...But the thoughts in my head sound diffrent then my real voice..I dont know if thats normal 
  Idk i feel like almost everyone i come into contat with is out to get me. The days seem to run together so perfectly its so weird and hard to explain. I feel like Im fighting Demons.. 
 When I was younger, I remeber asking god to use me. I remeber telling him that I did not care how dirty or hard or painful it was. I just wanted him to use me..Even if it was like JOB..But Now I cant help but think he is testing me.And Im sad to say I want out...I want to feel free again in my head.. 
 I dont want to sound crazy...this probably sounds irrational 
so 
Am i crazy or what..Please help
