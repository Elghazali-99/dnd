I am 21 and my girlfriend is 18.  We have been dating almost 7 months.  She has had one boyfriend; the only person she has had sex with prior to me.  She has told me (because I had already found out bits from elsewhere) that she has had 3 other guys that she has performed sexual acts with.  Two of those were when she was in 8th grade.  I had already know about her boyfriend and the other guy (a prior friend) which was recent 
 I have spent 6 months constantly being stressed, anxious, and depressed.  Constantly having intrusive thoughts that are sometimes triggered and sometimes not.  They are always looming over me.  My mind races and I end up crying a large amount of the time.  I know some details of what happened in these encounters, so the images/scenes are quite vivid and devastating. As time went on, the thoughts still persisted majorly but were occurring less frequently.  I only found out about her two encounters in 8th grade a few days ago.  I feel like everything has just been renewed.  Any progress I had made vanished.
 I would say that my brain always "wants" to be sad.  It throws every negative thought at me that it can possibly think of.  It finds crying desirably/therapeutic in some sense.
 I exercise regularly. I have gone through therapy. I have taken many meds (Xanax, d-amphetamine, Lamictal Cymbalta, and Wellbutrin).  I was taking 90 mg of Cymbalta for several months, and I never noticed any changes or improvement.  I then switched to Wellbutrin.  I have been on 300 mg for well over a month with no results.  Just today my new psychiatrist bumped me up to 450 mg. I have low expectations.  He also started me on Lamictal 3 weeks ago, and I am on 50 mg (increasing 25 mg every 2 weeks).  The ONLY times I have felt relief we in the initial euphoric periods of taking d-amphetamine, which quickly wears off.
 Are there medications better suited for me?  
 Why have mine not helped? 
 What course of action could possibly help me get better?
