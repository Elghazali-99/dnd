Think i have been through more in the past 4 weeks than most people my age have, what with losing my virginity, getting pregnant, losing my first love. Been pretty dramatic, i feel so emotional all the time, maybe its still the effect of my termination, maybe its the effect of a broken heart, either way i have never felt so hopeless, lonely and pathetic in my life. I started to cut myself, i swore i'd never do that.. but somehow now i understand how physical pain can overwrite emotional pain even if just for a few minutes, its worth it. It seems that its never ending, like  i will never be happy. i will never trust a boy again not properly, he's ****** me up properly I'll give him that. he promised me he wouldn't mess me around anymore, said he couldn't loose me again and that he Loved me. A week and 6 days since he said that and i believed him I'm sitting here miserable, single and unable to talk to the one person i thought i would always have. he gave me no reason to feel like this about him yet every time i think of him and how i can't even want to have him because of how he treated me, my heart breaks over and over and over again and it hurts more and more every time and i don't think i have any more tears left. I'll never be able to forget him, he was my first love, my first time and the father of my first child. everytime i think of that I'll think of him, i can't change that. Now i suppose its half past 11 and the time of day i dread its dark, silent and now i get to curl up in bed, and think. and i no exactly what i'll think about, ill dream about him to, i cant even control that.
