I'm currently 19 weeks pregnant. Ever since I've been pregnant, my husband has been more angry and frustrated. This morning while we were driving to work together, he offered to drop me off at Starbucks so I can get breakfast for the both of us since I have time to spare before I have to clock in for work. As we arrived at Starbucks, he was trying to park. He couldn't parallel park and scratch my car front bumper on the curb so hard that the bumper is about to fall off. He find ally parked and I head into Starbucks to get bus breakfast. As soon as I got back to the car, he started yelling at me with so much hatred and anger in his eyes and tone of voice. He blamed me for the scratched up bumper. He got so angry with me and drove crazy to the office where I was afraid for my life and my unborn baby life. As soon as we parked the car and started walking to the office. He would slam doors and make a huge fuss in front of our co workers. He told me next time to go get my own ****** food and that its my fault the car got scratched. 
 I told him that he shouldn't yell at me because he offered to drive me to Starbucks and he was driving my car and caused damaged to my car. So I shouldn't be getting yell at. He was wrong all the way yet he blamed me for everything. Please help me. We are newly weds only been married for 9 months and I'm pregnant with our first baby and I'm 19 weeks. Should I leave him?
