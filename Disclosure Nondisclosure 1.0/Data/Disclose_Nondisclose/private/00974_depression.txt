I sit here at a computer. In the other room, a load of c&nts I hate giggle and laugh. It's another 'party' my mother has gathered people and turned them against me. I plan to sleep through tomorrow.  I have never been happy. My earliest memory is of my mother reducing me to tears on my birthday because we'd had a nice make-believe day and I didn't want it do end. She smacked me so hard she bruised me and told me she wished I was dead. My earliest memory is of that ***** threatening to kill me on my birthday, but I have always been told it was my fault. The sick thing is, I still love her. I hate her so fecking much, but I still love her. When I was young I asked her if she loved me. She sat me down and told me that she hated me SO MUCH, and as a person she thought I was scum, but because I was her child, she still 'loved me'. 
 Both my parents are borderline psychopaths with difficult childhoods. They never HURT me, which makes me lucky, but I can't remember when I didn't cry myself to sleep because their verbal and emotional abuse makes me so sad and so tired. My mother used to enjoy smacking me and threatening me, and during my adolescence used to frequently tell people I knew lies about me, and throw all my belongings out of the house in a big black sack. She once threw a large metal chair at my head and was sad when it merely hit a counter.
 I enjoyed school, since I was away from them.
 My cousin, my sister and their family, enjoy abusing me too.
 I just don't want anything to do with people any more. They hurt me so much. I just want to die.
