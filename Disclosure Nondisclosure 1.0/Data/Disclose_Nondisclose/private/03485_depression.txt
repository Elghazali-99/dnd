Hi. Sooo I'm 17 and I've been suffering from anxiety for as long as I can remember. Two years ago I was diagnosed with depression and have been taking celexa ever since. The past few months have been horrible. I have a lot of stuff that I keep bottled up inside of me and it all came out and I'm pretty sure I had a mental breakdown. I have never liked talking to people but I decided to open up to my school counselor. She said if I needed to talk or just needed to do my class work in her office I could. So yesterday I did but instead of doing work I cried for a good three hours. Now I feel sick. Upset stomach, headache, anxiety, I can't think or talk right and I just want to cry all the time. Another thing is I get very attached to some people who just made me feel good by hugging me or something simple and my counselor has become that person. But the bad thing is I am having separation anxiety if I don't see her when I walk by the office. It's making things worse and I have no idea what to do about anything at this point. And advice or opinions? I just want to feel better.
