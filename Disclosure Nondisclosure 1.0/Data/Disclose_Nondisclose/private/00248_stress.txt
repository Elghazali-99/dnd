I'm only 16 years old and I'm really scared and uncomfortable right now, I feel like I'm always suffocating and have shortness of breath most of the time. The thought of dying has been plaguing me for the past month, I don't know if it had to deal with the severe stress I was going through the past month. But It has affected my daily life, I always worry and have mixed emotions every single day, It's like everything doesn't feel right. I feel like everything I do, I feel like I'm doing it for the last time, I can't enjoy ANYTHING without the thought of dying! I'm exhausted most of the time because I tend to worry a lot about what's going to happen. I have this weird feeling in my lower throat and I don't know if its a serious condition. Sometimes my throat gets tight and it feels uncomfortable to breathe, but it's mostly the breathing sensation that is bothering me. I try to take slow long breaths in and out to calm myself down but it doesn't work it just makes me feel like I can't and then my breaths either turn shallow or I gasp for air again. Please someone attempt to reassure me that I won't die or suffer forever because I'm going crazy. I don't know what to do and it makes me depressed and gets in the way of doing things like my school work or being with my friends. I hate feeling like this everyday, these things that are happening has made a really big impact on me, I used to be a very happy, now it's like I'm in a small room and can't get out.
