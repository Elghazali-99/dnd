I am 13 years old, and I really neeed help. I had quite a tramatic life at a young age which resulted in many mental problems that surficed as life begin to even out. When I was 7 I was diaognosed with ocd, depression, and anxiety. As of recently around thanksgiving of 2010 i had a very bad break down and have not been able to attend school and had to be homeschooled and barely can leave the house. Nothing really onset it I just broke down. I have been a cutter secretly since the age of 5. And my mood can go from happy to suicidal in the course of hours. My parents are not help because they believe i am just a very hormonial teenager, even though my dad should since he went through the same thing. I can not concentrate because of loud noises in my head i can not understand, the words. And i also feel as if everything is flying by and the world is spinning. When i become very distraught i reside in my head trying to exscpe the world. I can hear a voice tell me to do things as counting my steps jumping up and down x amount of times which resulted in being labled having ocd. I can not even function regurally without a breakdown or going into a mode where i listen to my head. Because i worry when the voice says i will have a consequence if i dont do what it says even though i dont belive it i do. i have constant  headaches and i can not go to sleep at night. Lately i have been contemplating suicide again, and have been very sure it would be best even though i dont have a reason to die other than my constant pain which i can not take anymore, not for my sake but for those around me i effect. I have also been thinking about trying 2 check myself into a mental hospital to get my life back together, or maybe to be forgotten about those around me. Im cluless and im scared cuz i have no idea whats wrong with me all i know is that i can not keep doing what i am doing and if something dosent change i am gonna be dead soon.
