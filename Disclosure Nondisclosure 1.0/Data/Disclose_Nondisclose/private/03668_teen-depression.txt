I'm 16 years old and ever since I was about 11 or 12 years old I've, apparently, had a depression problem. Personally I thought this was normal so I never said anything about it and I've been through a lot of rough times, I have a few scars I'm not so proud of and I've (attempted) overdosage a few times but recently I found out that isn't the way your supposed to feel normally and I was put on 10mg a day Lexapro a little over 2 months ago (about december 20ish) It made me feel a bit better after about 2 weeks of using it though I really really hate the side effects from it. But now I'm starting to think it was just a placebo because now I feel like it isn't working and I feel like ending my life pretty much 24/7 and I have been thinking of stopping lexapro and just not taking it anymore because I don't want to start jumping from one med to the next.
 One thing good is I don't feel anxious as much anymore and I haven't had a panic attack in about a week or so but I still feel completely hopeless and I feel like all these meds are just trying to shield me from the facts of life just so I can grow up make money for the government and die just like everyone else. Nothing interests me anymore except video games and music, I can't watch certain movies without being completely bored out of my mind and usually I can only play video games for about 30 minutes straight then it starts to bore me which leads to me having suicidal thoughts about myself and I'm just not sure what to do anymore.
 Also with the lexapro I have noticed, as well as my dad, that I have become more fidgity like I can't stop moving and it makes me feel like some sort of crack addict not to mention I have to take about 2 benadryl a night just to goto sleep, I tried melatonin but it didn't sedate me enough to put me to sleep though sometimes I can manage to fall asleep on it after about 45 minutes to an hour or so.
I'm pretty sure that my depression isn't just because of teenage hormones, all of my friends (especially ones who are considered the stereotype of being "emo") who talk about being diagnosed with depression never talk about hurting themselves or killing themselves and they claim they haven't tried to kill themselves unless something drastic happened, I on the other hand could go grab a bottle of ibuprofen and down it right now and not give a damn hence why I'm on this forum typing this up.
 Any help?
