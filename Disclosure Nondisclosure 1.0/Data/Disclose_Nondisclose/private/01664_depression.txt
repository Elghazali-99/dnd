Im 18 and finay realized , I had to develop depression and axienty at 16. I didn't know all I know is I started acting weird. When I get around crowds or a lot of people my palms would get sweaty. I would want to just would want to hurry up and do what I have to do to get out of there by any means . it started getting worse and worser soon as I turned 17, I literally just didn't want to go anywhere. Not talk to anyone , stay to myself , get frustrated, cry a lot, stress , all the above. At the time I didn't realize what was happening to me...til now. Sorry to say at times I just want out. And I have no one in my family to talk to about this , all they do is make it worser. the depression made me do stuff that I regret , and now I can't fix it , nobody understands me when I say I do things that I have no answer for , my thoughts are always clouded , I can't think straight at all. I just need someone that understands me  and is going through the same senerio as me...its hard battling this illness.
