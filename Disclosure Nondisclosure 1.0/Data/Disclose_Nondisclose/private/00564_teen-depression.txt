I'm 18 and have been suffering from a very complex depression. I have been diagnosed with Tourettes Syndrome, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (primarily Social Anxiety), and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I take Lexapro and Xanax (as needed). Lexapro has been the only effective medication however it does not help enough nor does it prove to be more effective increasing the dosage. After experiencing repetitive emotional traumas starting at age 13 the depression and anxiety intensified each year. When i switched schools at 16 for a better education things went haywire. I began self-loathing, my anxiety shot up, and there are a lot of poisonous ingredients to this depression that became very complicated. I eventually withdrew from school near the end of my senior year because it was tearing me to pieces. Right now i'm at home trying to finish up two online classes that i need to graduate from this high school. I am not finding the energy to do what needs done. My mind will often drain after only two problems on the homework depending whether it's a good day or bad day. Due to the particular emotional trauma i have a difficult time expressing anger or getting angry as a motivator. I do the opposite and breakdown instead. I am known as a border-line genius and semi-savant and it's been speculated i have Aspergers Syndrome but no diagnosis. All i want to do is have the ability to do what is necessary so i don't waste my life away. It feels like my mind is basically destroying me. I am unhappy 100% of the time. Any recommendations would be great, even the unusual ones of course. For example, i  use to put my head in the freezer a lot almost habitually. That was when i was younger however but for some reason it seemed to calm me down.
