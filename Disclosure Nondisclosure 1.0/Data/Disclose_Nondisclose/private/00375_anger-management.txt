So, I have this cycle that seems to repeat itself every once in a while. Generally I'm a pretty relaxed person, and the first to crack a joke, and the first to laugh at a joke somebody else tells. Every few months though, I feel sudden uncontrollable bursts of rage that persist for hours before finally subsiding. People who I liked I suddenly find myself lashing out at without regards for what it will do to relationships. I can't help but feel like I'm sabotaging my own life, and that alone is cause for concern. The outbursts have been going on sporadically since I was about eight, so nine years now. I've been to counsellors before, but never really taken anything from it. I was never abused as a child, and I've led a fairly normal life except for my outbursts, which everybody who knows me closely has had first hand experience with.
 I'm looking for any insight that people may have, maybe people who have had the same problem as this who found a way to get over it are willing to provide some. That's all for now, thanks in advance.
