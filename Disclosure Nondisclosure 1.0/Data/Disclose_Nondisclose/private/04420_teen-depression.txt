Look, this isn't some lame 'emo phase'.  I'm really serious.  I don't think I'm actually DEPRESSED persay, because I can still be happy, y'know? Like, if I'm not alone/thinking, I'm happy.  But only if I'm with my friends.. Gr, this is hard.  How about I give you a scenario?  I'm at lunch with my friends, no one's really bothered me today, and they're all talking and laughing and making lots of jokes.  I still want to sit there and stare at a wall because I'm upset, but their jokes are just too funny to not laugh at, y'know? Like, I can be kinda happy around them.  We just found out my dog has cancer and even with surgery he won't make it.. and everyone's upset but me... like.. I'm too NUMB to care..  and my mother said,  "I don't really want to give him surgery, because then he'll just suffer.  I watched my mom suffer, and my dad suffer, and Kimba suffer, I don't want to watch him suffer too." and my first thought was, 'Well if you don't want people you care about to suffer, can I off myself already?  Because I'm suffering.. or does it only count if you can SEE them suffering?'  Granted, I did NOT say this.  She doesn't even know my state right now, but then again, I've given out so many cries for help that I'm almost mad at them.  Like, two years ago, I ran away.  A year later, I showed them two full arms that were chock full of angry, red cuts.  I refused a phsyciatrist and said if they took me, I wouldn't talk.  (I'd gone to one when I ran off, and I hated it.)  All they did was talk to me about how they cared and MADE me promise to never do it again.  Obviously, I've broken that.. but yeah.  The point is I'm not sure if you could say I'm actually depressed, because I'll get in these really happy, really random moods.  (My emotions are like a f***ing roller-coaster.)  Is it just teenage hormones?  ..is it normal that I wanna kill myself?
