I'm 46 years old and think I may be perimenopausal.  I have a history of PCOS, never been pregnant that I know of, but possibly may have miscarried once or twice before I could have gotten a BFP (due to a large, unusual looking clot I passed).  My periods are usually every 25-26 days.  The last 3 months or so, I have been getting them every 22-23 days.  Flow is a bit lighter, but not a lot so.  I'm also noticing that everytime I have a period now, I get major breast pain (only a few hours before I start my period and sometimes while AF is there, but not usually afterwards).  I've never really been a PMS'y kind of person before now.  This last month my breast size has increased noticably.  Even my husband, who never notices anything like that even remarked on it.  I am normally a standard B size and I feel like I'm at least a C.  The thing I've really noticed a change in is my digestion.  I've not had great digestion for years, but the last few months they have been horrible.  I have been gluten-free for a long time, so gluten is not the culprit.  I'm not consuming dairy or sugar either.  I take digestive enzymes and Betaine HCL with every meal and I also use Slippery Elm if I have stomach upset.  Anyway, the last few months I get painful bloating and gas everytime I eat and it lasts sometimes all day.  Tums is not helping and neither is my other stuff.  I do have a history of candida as well, so I thought maybe my candida might be flaring.  I just find it odd that it's gotten worse around the time that my periods started changing and my breasts started growing.  Just to be certain I wasn't pregnant, I have taken two pregnancy tests (about a month apart) and they were both negative.  My mom's friend told me her breasts grew from a C to a G when she went through menopause.  Has anyone experienced this and the digestive changes?  So uncomfortable. Thanks.
