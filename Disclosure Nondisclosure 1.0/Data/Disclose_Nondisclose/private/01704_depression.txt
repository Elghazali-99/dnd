I'm a 43 year old man and I've had a bad breath since childhood. I've felt embarrassed about this ever since I knew about it. I've tried all possible means to eliminate the problem without success. It has led to me isolating myself, and developing very low self esteem. I could not have personal relations, and I've never felt confidence to approach the other sex. Throughout my life, I've had anxiety and depression about the issue, and I simply do not know how to handle social situations. Four years ago I planned to take my life, but changed my mind the last minute, and sought a psychiatric help. They gave me cipralex and I used the medicine for four years. The medicine helped me a bit with my anxiety, but my issues could not be resolved as they are tied to my bad breath. Last year I was diagnosed with hepatitis b, and I feel also my chronic kidney problem has worsened lately. All these have added to my misery, and lately  I've really been feeling hopeless, and as if my life has ended. I do not have appetite, no interest in life, no energy and no regular sleep. I do not know what I'm going to do; I just feel I've reached my end-point. Do you have some suggestions?
