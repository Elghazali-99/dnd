I pretty much have every symptom of schizoid personality disorder but I'm absolutely not cold or emotionless at all!!  I have an overwhelming desire to be "human" on top but my subconscious feels so disconnected.  All I do is live in my daydream world,can't deal with social interaction (it's like I'm in shock after speaking to some people and I blush uncontrollably),can't have a relationship with the opposite sex(when it gets past innocent flirting I feel dirty,wrong,like I'm a child and I don't trust they truly look at me as if I'm a sexual being ) but have a very dirty mind...literally the only thing I don't have is coldness.  I'm buddhist and have an immense love for people but as if I'm an alien looking from the outside...  I have genius iq as does my father.  My parents are both drs and they are both are/where not affectionate.  There is a strong family history of mental disorders (father has multiple diagnosis of schizophrenia and OCD).  I never saw my parents kiss or touch each other.  I do feel as if I'm being watched and have trouble even walking past people.   I have trouble maintaining friendships(ie hanging out on a regular basis,going to parties) but do have a small group of friends I am comfortable around...  Mostly my biggest issue is I can't have sex and I don't live in reality...I do have the desire to be "normal".   Now as I child I was very sexual(masturbation at a young age) and when my mother caught me,I'd get spanked....is this why I'm like this or am I schizoid??
