Hello, 
I'm 22 and I have had a mental issue for three years now that is ruining my life. 
When I was 20, after attending a very good high school and a good prep class, I sat many exams to be admitted in business school (hence why i was in a prep class for two years). However I did not do as good as I thought since I had really worked hard for the past two years, and had to get into a school that is ok, but not that good compared to what I had proven to be my "talent" in mock exams.
I went there, started living alone and partying way too much so I failed my first year (I actually passed but not with flying colors and could not go in exchange to the best schools). I procrastinatd a lot. Ever since that day, I keep procrastinating all the time, I feel worthless and am ashamed to tell which school I'm from (top 10 in France) and I can't seem to move forward. Most of my friends were a bit disappointed but worked at school and moved on. I just can't seem to move on, and I'm stcuck. I study finance but find no interest in it, I just do it for the money. But I'm not good, I don't commit enough. 
The blame is just on me, but I can't live with that ever lasting guilt of having failed when I could have done so much better if I had just been more involved in mys studies. I have plans and hopes but i don't succeed since I don't work hard enough; As a consequence I'm depressed nearly all the time, kept a few friends and never had a girlfriend. Otherwise I cant complain, I have excellent life conditions. I know this may sound stupid but it's really bugging me too much. All I think about is what I could have done in the past.
Before I schedule an appointment with a therapist I just wanted your opinion on that matter. I should also point out that I feel overconfident one day and like the biggest looser ever the next one. I have a lot of mood swings that i did not have before and can be agressive.
Thank you in advance and have a pleasant day.
