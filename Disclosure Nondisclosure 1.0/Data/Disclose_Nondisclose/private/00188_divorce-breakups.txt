This is a psychological question 
After 16 years of marriage we went through a crisis, he worked and worked non caring of me and the kids 
I felt abandoned, even on sundays we could not stay together because he took the kids to his mother's to have lunch, but he lefte me home 
I then thought he did not care for me and started to go on a crisis and I asked for separation 
I have now been separated for 5 years and got divorced 
last december
All through  these steps  i have slowly begun to realize it s been a terrible mistake and i am missing him terribly . I know it may sound crazy , but it's what i m feeling and it's strong. 
 I miss him , the simple things we did together, staying in the family with our kids . I now see that it was all wrong, and i would turn back time and find a different way to solve our problems... 
I had a relation for 3 years after the separation, we broke last summer, but now he has another woman, and I don't know what step to take , if tell him or not 
It is a terrible situation where I feel guilt , loneliness , jealousy, and a mix of negative feelings all together and in some moments i feel i cannot cope ...
I only have my kids for whom i live , and a feeble hope 
I am not strong in this period , i need to restore my self-confidence and maybe then i will try to talk to him
We used to be both very much in love , it was all a series of misunderstandings, but i feel it can't end this way 
I know i may sound ridiculous . But i made a mistake and want to fix , restore my relation with him .. 
Thank you all for your advice
