I had wrote in a questions about my girlfriend who was sexually abused more then 5 or 6 times. She never goes into too much detail. When we frist met about 8 years ago, she had told me when she was young she was molested by her brother. Well as a person who has never even though of child sexual abuse, i became a little upset to hear this..im not sure today why i felt this way, but the things i said after that made her feel like it was her fault. I do remember saying why did you let that happen..maybe i didnt take into account that she was only 3 and there probobly wasnt much she could do.
Latley we have been trying to talk about it, and she told me that what i said back then makes her feel like it was her fault..I know it wasnt her fault and I just cant seem to get it through to her. She loves me I know, but she doesnt trust me..She says when we have sex, i touch her like "they" do..I just love her and i dont just want sex out of lust, as she puts it..I really need advise..please..Thank you all Jason
