HI
 i want to submit a problem which is very intricate and a big problem for my whole family.
My sister's age is 28 years and she is single.She was a fat girl but she wanted to become smart and started dieting and did it too much.She left eating and became smart maniac.She made a habbit to go up the stairs and down the stairs daily.This is her routine exercise and now she is too weak that no one can say that it is her.she has got bony steucture and no flesh on them.But the more adveerse thing is that she is not leaving her this practise.She does not take proper meal.She throws out the meal when no one is there and says that she has eaten up.She avoids eating before us.however if we succeed to make her eat something she soon goes to stair and starts her exercise saying that she has eaten too much.we have tried our best but she is not ready to listen us.
 The second matter is that she thimks that germs are all over her.she thinks that germs are flying in air and stick to our body and dress.she always goes on washing her hands with soap.She washes her hands not less than  30 times a day.She avoids tuching any thing for example she does not open the door with her hands because she thinks that the handle of the door is full of germs.she opens it with her leg or foot.she does not embrace anyperson because she thinks human is full of germs.However if she happens to open/close the door,or shake hand to any one she rushes to the wash room and quickly washes her hands.This habbit is increasing and becoming more and more intense.Now she comes back from school,(she is a school teacher) she daily washes her dress with detergent saying that germs of children are in these dress.she daily does it.She avoids shaking hand to any one.
  This is a big problem for us.People have noticed her these habbits and we get very embarassed.If we try to talk her on this matter politely,she becomes angry and annoyed.All of family members have tried their best nut to no progress.
She thinks that we are backbiting her,whenever she looks rest of the family members sitting together.It is noteworthy that she avoids sitting with us.She thinks that all the family members are always talking about her and making a fun of her.She thinks that we are her enemies.She becomes furious even if we talk her in the most polite manner.She keeps herself busy in her these silent activites throughout the day that is exercise and washing hands and washing clothings.We cannot take her to the Dcotor because she becomes furious on that that i am not mad.
 So this is the whole story.
I shall be thankful if you can give us any worth advise to come out of this situation because we love our sister.
