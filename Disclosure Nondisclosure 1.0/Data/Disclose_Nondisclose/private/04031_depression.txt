Hello,
 I have had depression for a number of years and I use drawing as a way to cope and distract myself when I feel particularly low. You could say that drawing is what gives me a reason to get out of bed. I can plug in my headphones, shut the door and forget that I'm suffering. I'm a really creative person, but it means that my imagination can be kind of toxic, so anything that distracts me is a bonus.
 Last July I began to experience what I assumed was artblock (for the first time ever). It gradually became worse over time and I am worried, as I feel like depression is beginning to take away all of the things that I love. I feel sad and empty and I've tried so hard to fight against it, but I just can't seem to win.
 I've heard of depression sufferers losing interest in things they used to enjoy, but I always thought that it wouldn't happen to me. Now that it is happening I'm a bit scared, because art was my safety net and without it I'm beginning to sink into what I think might be the start of something bad. I don't know what to do, it just isn't fair that this has being taken from me. :(
 How do you claw back motivation? How do you keep yourself afloat? I'm not expecting there to be a magic solution, but I don't want to give up.
