My name is Mary, and I am seventeen. I am at that point in my life where everything is about to change. I am leaving behind a chapter that I was extremely familiar with four about eight years, and now I am about to leave it all behind, I feel like. Not only that, My bestfriend of two and a half years and boyfriend of seven and a half months just decided to break up with me about a month and a half before leaving for the Marines. The break up occured about a week ago. Throughout the day, the heartache tends to lessen and at night it seems I have come to terms with what has happened between my ex and me, but then in the mornings, reality sets in, and I cry. Today I had an anxiety attack and my breathing was shallow. I get about four hours of sleep everyday. I eat one meal a day. I dont find enjoyment in my everyday activites anymore. I feel as if I am stuck in a world that is slowly falling apart, and I am afraid that it will become destructive to my health. My heart is in pieces and my mind is in a whirl. I cant function and no longer feel the urge to want to function for the pain is too unbearable. I dont know what to do.
