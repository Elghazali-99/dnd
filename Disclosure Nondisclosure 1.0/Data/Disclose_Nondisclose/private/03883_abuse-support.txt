I posted a month or so ago about my babysitter being turned in by a neighbor of hers.  Well, the investigation is done and she admitted she threw my son down on the floor and now she is being charged with child abuse without injury charge.  There were questions of whether she took a shower with my son as well, they could not get her to admit that and she was supposed to take a polygraph this week, but her attorney recommended she not take the polygraph, so that is a done deal. I will never know if she took showers with my son or not.  I don't know if I should just keep quiet about things and let it go.  We are using another babysitter obviously.  THe detective also said that she had my son calling her "mom" and she felt like he was her "son".  
 Then she lied as well to the detective saying that she told me she did not want to watch my son anymore.  THat's not true.  
 But I guess since she lied about throwing him down, it's hard to know if anything she said was true or not.  Feel really like I've been manipulated!
