I cant remember when i was last happy, not laughing or smiling but genuinely happy. I do know that the first time i thought of suicide was back in 2010. In december of that year the 18th i heard that my friend had commited suicide, the following day another, neuther knew eachother or anything, at the start it made my depression worse made me loose hope and think well if these were two of the happiest peoplei knew abd they couldnt cope then how could i? But then for a while i saw the other side, how much pain it caused everyone and how happy maybe they could have been the next day if they gad just waited, so i waited and i still wait today for things to get better though i have bad days, im still here rigjt?  I havs thought of how to do this right down to what time and where, one day i was ready my mom wasnt expected back for a while and she was the only person i didnt want to find me so i attempted it standing on the chair with the rope around my neck ready and my mom came home her plans had changed, she truely saved my life. I still wait to this day for things to get better no matter how hard i can laugh ill always have a plan in the back of my head on doing it, and i know there is so many people like this out there but ive never told anyone i was ever this down on life and i had to get it out of my system for once.
