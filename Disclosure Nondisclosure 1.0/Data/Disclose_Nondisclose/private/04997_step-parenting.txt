My wife and I got married in august.  She has 4 children from a previous relationship 11, 9, 9, and 6. The twins are a boy and a girl. The bio father is not involved in any way in their lives. My 9 year old step-daughter was the first one who accepted me and called me daddy. Recently the others have followed suit. My problem is now my 9 year old step-daughter has stopped obeying and listening to me.  Most of our problem revolves around homework.  It takes her 4 hours to do her math homework alone.  I met with her teacher and he told me at school she is a perfect student. Always does things in a timely manner.  Yet at home it is a constant battle.  When I talk to her or when my wife talks to her she doesn't respond only stares at us.  We are at a loss. If she was only acting this way toward me i could understand it somewhat but why does she do it to both of us.  Today I wrote a note to her teacher in her planner (in pen) and when i checked it this afternoon after i picked the kids up from school, she had marked out part of it and changed the 4 hours to 1 hour.  When my wife and I approached her about it all we get is that dang blank stare. Help please
 Thanks, 
Tony
