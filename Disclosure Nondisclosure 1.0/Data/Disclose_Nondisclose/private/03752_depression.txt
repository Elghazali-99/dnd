Hi all,
please give me some tips and ways to survive school with this problem. Everywhere i go, the person beside me will start breathing heavily, covering his nose(using their sweater, mask, hand,etc) and they will all put their nose in their shirt. Every single one. Even those feets away from me does that.and make comments that it stink. but no one said it was fishy or fecal.
 in my school We have to attend lectures and everyone around me will always be like suffocating, using their scripts to cover their nose, on an on(u know what im talking about).
In the classrooms its worse because everyone is literally side by side, no space in between our tables or chairs at all.
 It is so frustrating that my family and best friend and all doctors cant smell me and everyone in school can. I have 12 hours in school a day.(continuous torture).i cant smell myself also.
 i skip lectures and classes and get scolded for it. i feel bad to stink up the place yet i feel so horrible every second in school.
 perfume or body spray wouldnt work it will stink more. I am not yet diagnosed so please give me some tips to reduce this odor or not be in close contact with people and also to deal with the teachers(for missing class) and my parents(scolding forcing me to school).
 this is getting out of hand because i refuse to go to school because i think i will kill myself there but my parents are forcing me there no matter what. they think im crazy because they cant smell me they think im just lazy.
 please please please give me some tips on how u guys would handle this situation..
thanks.
 Love,
depressed n stinky.
