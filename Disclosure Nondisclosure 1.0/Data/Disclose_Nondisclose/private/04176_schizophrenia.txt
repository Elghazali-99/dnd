Hello, I am a 20 year old female. I have been diagnosed with bipolar 3 years ago. I am in Nursing so I know the basics about Mental illnesses. I take Seroquel so my moods are stable. 4 years ago I had my first hallucination. It started with my eyes being closed, then I saw a shadow of a man eat a spider, then I saw a man dancing in my room but he was getting taller/shorter and the clothes were changing. I had no other episodes until 2 years ago. I saw a little girl standing in my room. For the next two weeks I hallucinated every night, sometimes I would see a boy, my pillow was a human face, or I would see a flash or something move in the corner of my eye. I would hear noise in my kitchen, but I would tell myself that no one was there, but then I would change my mind that there was someone, and I would go back and forth. I talked to my doctor, and this is when I started on Abilify. The night terrors went away.. until about a year ago when I saw a little boy in my backyard during the day. In this last year I have hallucinated a few times. I have experienced shiny dots and lines dancing in my entire vision. I am paranoid that there are people or spirits behind curtains or chairs. Other then my hallucinations, I do not have many other Schizophrenic symptoms. I have an extreme fear of the dark, and I always hallucinate in the dark. Recently, I have thought that when people touch their face, they are trying to signal something to me. Why do I hallucinate? Do I have schizophrenia or psychosis or even something else?
