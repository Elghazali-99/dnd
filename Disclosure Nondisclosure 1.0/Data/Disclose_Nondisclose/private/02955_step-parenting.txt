Hello
 Im 21 and my husband is 32. He has 2 kids from a previous relationship and we now have the kids for the summer since they are out of school. They are 7 & 8 yrs old. I am 30 weeks pregnant with my first child. My husband just started a new construction job this morning and has been gone since 7 am it is now 8:15 pm. And i had to call out of work today soni could stay home.with the kids. Last summer i wasnt bothered as much by this but being pregnant these kids are making me want to kill someone. They are very rude and disrespectful and i cant even let them go outside and play caise they dont listen to a word i say. I would love to get out of the house and do something but i cant take these  brats with me. I feel bad not only for.myself but for them too cause they came here to spend the summer with their daddy. Not me. Yet i am.the one at home everyday with these kids. Another thing. I am due july 28th and am.beyond excited and i feeo like the kids should go home at least the last week in june to give me time to prepare for my first baby. However daddy thinks they should stay here for the nirth of my son. Im not havin it. Please give me some advice!
