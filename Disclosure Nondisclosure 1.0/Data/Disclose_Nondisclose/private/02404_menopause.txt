Please, i just hope if somebody had or is having the same problem can help me.
I am 41 and started early menopause 2 years ago, at 39.
My gyn told me that i should start HRT, because of being so young, the hormones will be good for me in the future, to protect my bones and my heart. I did not know too much about hormones, adn at that time i was not having any menopause  symptoms at all, and just start PROMETRIUM 100 MG AT BED TIME AND VIVELLE-DOT, 0.025, twice a week.
I started reading and listening to everybody, and i was so SCARED, that after 6 months i stopped everything.
The thing is, now, one year and a half later, i am having really bad hot flashes and night sweats, it is been more than 6 months that i can not sleep at all. I am so upset, so sad, and desperate that i can not sleep.
Went to 2 other doctors, and they both basically said the same thing, that i need to be on HRT, because of my age.
I am scared of all the risks and feel like a fish without water. Don't know what to do.
I woke up this morning and said, i am going to start my hormones again today, because last night was just horrible.
please, what do you think about it?
what should i do?
thankyou
