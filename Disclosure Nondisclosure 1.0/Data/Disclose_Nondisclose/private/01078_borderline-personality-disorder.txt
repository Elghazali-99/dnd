We have a co-worker that has been sneaking food out of the  frig.  At first we thought it must be someone who might be hungry and can't afford groceries. 
 However, it has escalated to eating portions of other peoples food and and then later when emails go out asking "who took my lunch?", the food reappears in the frig. and obviously half consumed (they even eat food that has already been partially consumed).  Cakes and other food  for office parties have gone missing and reappear after questioning emails go out too.  
 Lately, something else has been happening.  Someone has been deficating and urinating in the woman's bathroom and leaving very messing stalls.  
 We have no idea who is doing either of these things!  It's a small office (maybe 25-30 and most people have worked there for years).  
 We even had camara's installed but not in the breakroom or bathroom (I think this was done because items were going missing from peoples cubicals).
 Definetely odd and diviant behavior.  Any suggestions on how to get this to stop?
