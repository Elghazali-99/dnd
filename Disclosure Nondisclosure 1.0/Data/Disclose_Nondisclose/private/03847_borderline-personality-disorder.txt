Hello! I had an idea that would blog my pregnancy's every step. Its not a normal pregnancy. Although my baby will hopefully be healthy, my mental state will not. I am not yet pregnant but tomorrow I will be seeing my OBGYN to check if I am healthy enough to conceive another child. On Saturday I will be talking to my med doctor about stopping my medication. I suffer from Bipolar and Borderline Personality Disorder. I started taking Lithium about 3 months ago when I was diagnosed. Lithium is a miracle for my family and I. I no longer have paranoid thoughts and I also don't think no one loves me. I am thinking logical and my relationships are growing in every direction. I have already spoken to my therapist who is a great support. My plan is to make a plan for each week so I will not relapse. My plan consist of seeing my therapist weekly and writing on this blog at least 3 times of week of what i am feeling and updating you guys of everything. Somethings might be very serious so just take caution. I have lived a very disturbing life and what i talk about in therapy will be posted. Thank you guys for support and time..If you would like to follow me you can do so on http://mommysbipolarpregnancy.blogspot.com/. Thank you
