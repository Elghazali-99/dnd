I have bee n w my fiancé for almost three years and we had ups and downs but  when its bad it's bad I love him but at first was more physical then any thing but now.... It's the verbal and emotional that's killing me inside I have always been happy pick up and go out had friends now I have now friend unless I am sleeping with them cause he's pressured me into another woman in our bedroom because of my past acts before his time!! He has beat down my spirit then tells me the love he has for me and how I mean the world to him then next screaming what a sloppy pig of a ***** I am no one will want me with my past I am dirty and will never amount to **** how when he looks at me I make him sick to his stomach how he uses me and lost love a long time ago talks about my taxes this year I spent on me and my son ( not common child ) I worked for when he hardly worked and they took his lil cash for child support . Tells me how he hate me and my kid that my son will never respect a ***** pig of a mother like me then after wants to hug and kiss me tell me how sorry he is and want to make love it's hard cause I don't want to leave I still have love but I have a five year old who sees me balling and breaking me down don't want him to think that's okay.then I don't wanna leave and see him with someone else and better thinking it was me. I have had issues getting pregnant and it's even harder he's younger then me and not mature or educated on fertility issues!!! But I need some advice and help and some kind of direction in this relationship!!!!
