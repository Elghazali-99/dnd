When I was about 6 or 7 my brother and I shared a room, he is 4 years older than I am. At the time I didn't know what sex was, and he told me to do something. So I did it. I didn't know it was bad, or wrong, or even what was happening. This went on until I was about 11. I'm now 17 and I told my boyfriend about it. He wound up telling my stepdad which told my mom. My mom told me I was a liar (my brother is now bisexual) and that I was a bunch of other names. I'm pretty sure no one believes me. I kept it hidden so long that I feel almost like I imagined the whole thing. Like I'm going crazy. I now have trust issues and am a clingy girlfriend and am driving him away. I started cutting again today because I'm afraid I'll lose him.. I have EXTREME self esteem issues. I feel like I'm not good enough for anyone. I'm depressed and I don't want my 4 month old son to go through all of this with me. My mother used to beat me and I can't depends on her. I have never had a mother figure that was good. I'm lost.
