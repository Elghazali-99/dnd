I've had depression most of my life, but anti-depressants always helped. I'm Fe, 68, and few months ago I spent 6 days in hospital. No help. Cannot afford a phychiatrist, but my Dr. has been trying to help I take450 mg of Effexor in a day and 450mg of generic wellbutrin in a day. My Dr said the wellbutrin would help me to want to do things I used to love to do. Said it would release more (dopamine) in brain. I'm not as depressed as I was because the effexor is probably working..The wellbutrin hasn't helped like Dr said it would. I have no motivation, everything is so overwhelming and I'm always very tired. Have to even make myself take a shower. Sorry but it's the truth. I don't want to go even to the store or Dr or anywhere.I've never been lazy!! But going somewhere upsets me so bad because I have to clean up. I do not want to do anything. everything is just too much. I have wonderful kids & grandkids but I don't see them a lot. My fault. does anyone on here know what can help me. I'm a totally different woman than I was before.Seems I have no life now.What little I do in my place, I have to make myself do it.I would love to enjoy my life again--getting old and worthless. What can I do? Medicare doesn't pay for professional help.
