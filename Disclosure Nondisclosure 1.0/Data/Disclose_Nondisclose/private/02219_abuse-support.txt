Almost a year has passed since I discovered my baby girl was molested by my teenage stepson.  i im hemediately took action and contacted law enforcement.  he has not seen my daughter nor will he.  i recently saw him for the first time in court.  he pled guilty for a lesser charge and said"true" as though he was bragging.  i hate him for the hurt he caused my daughter.  i am asking seeking feedback on endeing my marriage because of thi8s situation.  i lovw my husband dearly, and his son is not allowed in my home.  my husbands exwife is now forbidding my other two stepchildren from being around me or my daughter (8because she doesnt want them to think poorly of their brother and how i cried in the courtroom), i just want some advice from those that have lived through this.  is it to hard to even know of the perpertrators whereabouts or does it get easier???   my daughter is in counceling weekly and will continue.  i alsp have a child with my husband.  i appreciate your help.  
 love and healing
