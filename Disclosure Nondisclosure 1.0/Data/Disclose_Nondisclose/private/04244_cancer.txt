I was diagnosed about 3 years ago with a pineal cyst- I initially went to the hospital because I thought I was having a stroke. Several tests later, the doc said that i had a "freckle" size pineal cyst probably caused from head trauma some time during my life. Since that diagnosis, I have had severe vertigo, (which I am taking valium for), but i have severe headaches, my eyes are "twitching", I can't see as good as I could before (maybe I need glasses now, I'm 42). I have loss of balance which has made me fall down on more than one occasion, I find it hard to concentrate or remember simple things, and at times I get totally lost in conversing. I am seriously fatigued most of the time, sometimes I can sleep for 12-18 hours straight, other times not at all. My Doc hasn't acted like it's any big deal but I think my symptoms are worsening and I wonder if the cyst is growing. In May when I go back to the Doc for my script refill, I'm going to tell him I want tested to see if it has grown. I sympathize completely with everyone that has this, and I DO think it's a big deal and should not be dismissed as a NOTHING. Anything growing in your brain in such a dangerous area can't be good. God bless you all and maybe if we all start complaining, the Docs will take it more seriously. What does everyone think? You can reply to this or email me @ DBrown_428***@****
