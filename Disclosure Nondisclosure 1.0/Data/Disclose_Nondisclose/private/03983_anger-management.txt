Im 21.i have anger problems.im going to hell for sure.but i want to get my story out.i get angry really quickly but only when im pushed.i have a low threshold but i control if im pushed to it more than a couple of times.to which i have no control over and i rage.its happen about 5 times now.its only with my sister.she is 3 years younger to me.nearly the same physique as me.but its her who keeps crossing my threshold.it can be as silly as giving some place to sit in the bed and she keeps kicking me out.4-5 kicks and i go blind with anger and i punched her in the eye.i dont know what got over me.but each kick just raised my temper.i tried controlling only to a point but once it crossed thats the end of sanity.today this is what happened while i was on the phone with my mom who was abroad and i only asked to sit near the corner of the master bed which she was lieing in.the bed was free and she had the entire space to sit on.but she HAD to sit near the corner where the phone was kept.so on her refusal i sat in between and she started kicking me in the back.i tried to control myself but in a fit of rage i punched her in the eye.this is the 5th time im punching her especially in the face and idont know why.my dad used to hit in the face alot but i cant use that as an excuse.he and i have the same rage issues.he hits my mom to for releasing his anger(but not very often it happens once every couple of years).in return after i punched her in the eye she kicked me straight in the face and i my head hit the corner of the table.my back of my head is bleeding and so is my nose.right now i feel really bad i did that.and i cant seek help as i have no friends.
