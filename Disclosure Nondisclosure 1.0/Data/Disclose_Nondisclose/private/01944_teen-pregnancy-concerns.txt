Okay before you make fun of me and say mean things, I the hugest most paranoid worry wart on the face I the earth. So I've need done anything remotely sexual EVER (haven't even kissed a guy), but I'm having pregnancy symptoms? 
Three weeks ago, I went to the bathroom at a restaurant and it's a family bathroom, which means guys could've gone in there. And I got this crazy notion that maybe there was semen on the toilet seat or the toilet paper or something (even though I would've noticed if it was wet and white?? And why would a guy do that on public stalls?? Idk these are the things I think about). I kinda laughed it off then the rest of the night I was crazy bananas paranoid. You gotta understand, that's just the way I am. I've always made up things in my head that I was fearful of, like thinking I had a heart disease when I was nine and I started feeling all the symptoms. I'm thinking this might be the same? Idk I'm FREAKING OUT like literally every mornin when I wake up, I am flipping about this. Anyway here are my symptoms:
-very frequent headaches
-very frequent urination (I usually go twice a day but now it's more like 4 times)
-constipation (I never get constipated???)
- tender achey breasts (but I'm a very late bloomer, so they're still growing)
- weight gain (I have a fast metabolism and never gain weight so this is freaking me the heck out)
-slight mood swings
-MISSED PERIOD (IT WAS SUPPOSED TO COME THREE DAYS AGO??)
 I've gotten my period exactly one year ago last May, after my 16th birthday. And my low weight makes my periods irregular and all over the place, but I've never been late before, just really early..
I keep reading up on pregnancies online because the paranoia won't go away and some days I cry because of how worried I am...is that some sort of medical condition? Like how I'm always freakin out about little things and starting the symptoms myself? I did it all the time as a kid when I worried about having heart problems, or having cancer or a stomac bug...I freaked out so much that I caused my mind to convince me I have the symptoms. Is it possible that that's why I'm having these pregnancy symptoms? Idk but I'm flipping out, and nothing I read or tell myself will console me. I've been trying for the past three weeks. Please help. I'm a paranoid worry wart and I'm so scared:(
