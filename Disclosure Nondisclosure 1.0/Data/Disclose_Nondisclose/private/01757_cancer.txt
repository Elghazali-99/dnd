Hello, im a 16 year old high school student. About five months ago i was poking around my neck and i found that at the base of my neck on my left side, right inside between my collar bones. I found it strange that when i pushed on it, it didnt budge at all. it only moved when i moved my arm around, as if it was the muscle itself. I think it has slowly gotten bigger because now when i lift my arm strait up it will cut off circulation and my arm will go numb. Also my collar bone will feel sore because its hitting that. But besides that it is absolutley painless. i can push my thumb on it as hard as i can and it wont budge. the only outcome is that it will get a tiny bit sore. but the other weird thing is it doesnt move. like i cant even feel anything inside my neck moving to account for it when i push in, it just stays. It doesnt show through my skin at all no matter what way i turn. Also it is about (from what i can feel, it may go deeper into my body but my collar bone wont let me feel) 1 inch tall (vertical with my neck) and about 3/4 inch wide. It is also very hard. I am worried because now it is starting to dictate which way i can move my left arm comfortably. i have a doctors appointment scheduled for 3 weeks but i was looking for some answers sooner. anything helps, thank you.
