I went through depression for just over a year, now its just on and off stages. I got to such a low point in my life. I lost so much weight, I used to cry non-stop, I used to puke for no reason and then it got to the point where I decided it was too much to handle so I attempted suicide. 
I took so many sleeping pills and was close to death- until my best friend saved my life. 
From then, I was still depressed but I knew I wasn't alone. I had my best friend. I have always felt like my family never understood me so I haven't ever really spoke to them about what goes on in my life. 10 months on I feel like suicide was a cowardly way to try and escape things. There are many other ways how you can deal with things, like; talking to someone you trust, phoning a help line or even writing things down. 
Don't ever feel like you are alone because chances are someone else is probably going through much worse than you. Think of what you can do to help the world instead. I started small and tried to donate blood but I didnt weigh enough. I'm 18 and 7st 6lbs. So next year I'm going to third world countries to help teach english to children. 
Help the world, our generation is the change. 
You are not alone.
