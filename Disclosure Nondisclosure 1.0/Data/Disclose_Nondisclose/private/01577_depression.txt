Switched from Lexapro 30 mg to Paxil 40 mg because the Lexapro had stopped being effective after two years. (Prior to that was on Zoloft 150 mg for almost 10 years.) I did the switch overnight just as I had going from Zoloft to Lexapro. I'm currently at the 4 week mark, and I'm feeling worse than ever. I had been feeling good with some minor ups and downs, but yesterday I fell into bad depression along with panic. I haven't felt this bad in years. I typically can overcome the anxiety if my mood is good, but this added depression is making it impossible. I'm really at a very low point. Logically, it would seem the dose of Paxil might be too low, but I'm wondering if maybe this isn't the drug for me. I switched from Zoloft to Lexparo and felt better within three days, never looking back. This is a month on Paxil and I feel worse than I did when I was on Lexapro. Several people have suggested asking about a SNRI like Effexor, but obviously I wouldn't be able to do an overnight switch, so I'm wondering if I should try another SSRI first, like Prozac or Luvox. Dx is anxiety/panic, depression, and OCD. Any input appreciated. Thanks.
