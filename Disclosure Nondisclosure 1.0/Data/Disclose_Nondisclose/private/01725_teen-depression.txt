Everything feels like its going on to fast with me, I had a boyfriend three months ago, we were close but we didnt go out for long. I told him everything, I'm still not getting over him, alot of things went on between us. I lost his kid, after we had broke up. Since we have broke up though, I have gone off the rails, sleeping around, miss using drugs, getting in with the wrong crowds, arguing with my parents:/. I just cry and cry and I don't understand why?:| my bestmate thinks I have depression, but I keep saying to her, I'm not a mad woman?:S She wants me to go and see my GP but I don't feel confident to do that because my mum might see, and ask me why I feel, well, depressed because she works for the NHS. I'm worried about my brother aswell, hes in alot of trouble recently and also mourning the death of his 14 year old cousin, because me and him aren't real brother and sister. I don't know what to do:/ I cant tell my mum about what happened between me and my ex, and I cant talk to him because we just don't talk anymore:/help?!
