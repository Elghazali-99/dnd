Do I or should have any hope to save my family and my marriage. My wife is cheating on me with a guy that is 5 years younger and lives with his mom 4 states away. This guy is a lier and manipulates her. He has texted me threatening my family and kids. He has texted my daughter acting like it was me telling her sexually explicit things about her mom perforoming on him. He has even texted her nasty stuff acting like it was me that did it. He gets away with it cause he uses some program that the police have not been able to track. It comes from all different numbers and VTEXT SENDER. He also has been to prison. She tells me lies all the time about he is not the one and then she is with him in a hotel again for a week. She is an alcoholic so I believe this is part of why she can't stop. I filed for divorce and would really rather her get the help she needs and try to save our family. She has been pulled I we with my nine year old son in the car and blew .23 and he let her go but called DCFS. They can't do anything cause she wasn't charged with a crime. She thinks she is untouchable and I  believing it at this time. I want her back and sober is there any way I can save this woman from totally ruining my and her lives along with our children. Thanks
