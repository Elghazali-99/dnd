Hello all
recently (for past 3 months) I've been obsessed with the idea that someone I know has cancer. This is due to the fact that in one photo I saw a catheter-like tube which was transparent, wrapped around his neck. Then one guy told me that this was a catheter which is often used for chemotherapy, and I believed him, although he's not a doctor, he's just a biologist and hasn't ever seen a catheter in live. I'm saying this because I googled almost all kinds of catheters and the one that guy ha around his neck, looks very different from hickman and gorosh catheters which are used for chemotherapy and placed in subclavican vien or external jagular vien of neck (excuse me if I spelled it inccorectly). The other important fact is that, the man I'm talking about, had this thing wrapped over his neck on the day of his concert (he's a musician), and even if he had cancer I have no clue why would he recieve the treatment on the day of concert. Besides, he looks great, he's hair hasn't fallen out or anything, and is full of energy, travelling abroad and having many concerts. After the day I saw him on picture with that "tube", I saw him again in live several days after, and he didn't have anything like that anymore. I saw him for many times during past 3 months and he doesn't look like a sick person who's recieving chemotherapy or anything. I asked some of his friends and they told me that he had a sore neck. Most of them told me nothing's wrong with him and he's ok. The problem is that I can't just go and ask him, and even if I do so, I'm sure I still won't believe him, because I'm obsessed with this idea.
 Anybody knows anything about tubes wrapped around neck and their meaning?
please help me with any appropriate information you own. Thanks scencierly.
