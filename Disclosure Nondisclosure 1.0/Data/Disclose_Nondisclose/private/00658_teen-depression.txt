i'm an eighteen year old and have just entered my last year in high school. I have now come to terms with the fact that I am depressed and have been for a while. Depression runs in my family; both my grandmother and my uncle suffer from extreme depression while another uncle is bi-polar. I have a very bad relationship with my mother. she is verbally abusive towards me and makes me feel crap and unworthy. I think its the way she was brought up. She has never once told me she loved me but has made me cry almost every single day of my life. whats worse is that I'm used to it. And now i dont even feel so bad anymore because its so routine. I feel especially bad for my younger brother who is only 7 and is already angry at the world and acts out constantly. its the way my mother treats him. and i have learnt to behave in the same way :(  I have nobody to talked to because a went back a grade and all my friends from my class have left for university. I have not made any friends in my new class. It's been a year. I feel alone. All the time. So alone that I had to resort to writing on this blog. I also have no confidence or self-asteem whatsoever and am painfully shy. i feel ugly and weird and misunderstood. anyways, im depressed and need help. BTW i live in a country where depression is a taboo topic and where there aren't many specialists that i can talk to- so therapy isn't really a viable option. WHAT DO I DOO :(
