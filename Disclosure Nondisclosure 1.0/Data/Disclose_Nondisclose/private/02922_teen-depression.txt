My step daughter has been through some rough times. She came to live with myself and my husband(her father) about a year ago after her mother was incarcerated....About 5 months ago her and her brother(my son) came home from church with her grandfather and my son came rushing in in front of her saying that Serena(my stepdaughter) had cut herself!!!!! I was extremely shocked.. So I took a deep breathe and went to her as calmly as I could...I asked if this was true and why she did it......she went on to tell me that her friend was doing it so she wanted to try it and how stupid she feels for doing it....I told her that it wasn't a very smart thing to do but she isn't stupid...well it has been a very long and exhausting 5 months since she's been to a behavioral facility, she's had councilors, and she has me who she can talk to at any time about anything that's hurting her or making her mad. I know I'm not her mom and I'm not trying to take her moms place. I have done everything I know to do and I literally have to keep an eye on her all day every day. I'm physically and emotionally exhausted...I am at my wits end what can I do?
