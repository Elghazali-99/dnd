I've been with my husband for 9 years. He has three children, none of which lived with us at first. The problem child was shipped to his father because of issues with his mother's husband without any notice about two years ago.One year into college he got  worse. He was very disrespectful towards me and while his father tried to help it got worse until we split up. Things smoothed out with my husband and I returned 6 months later to a monster. There was much tension between the son and his father and my stepson and I. Eventually two months before graduation without the knowledge of his father my stepson moved back with his mother in a different country. Now that he is almost done with school over there he wants to return here to continue where he left off. He is going to be 19 and is very much influenced by his mother who hates me and disrespects me any chance she gets and now does not want to pay for his schooling. My husband is willing to allow him back home only if she pays for his schooling. I have no children with my husband. I cannot bear living with the monster. What should I do?
