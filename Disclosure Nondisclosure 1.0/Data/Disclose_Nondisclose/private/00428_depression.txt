I'm looking for help for my bipolar/ADD son.  He has been struggling for 6 years to get stable.  The main problem is his ADD!.  He currently takes Abilify, Lamitcal and Vyvanse.  The Vyvanse was working well for the first 3 years at 30 mg. but has had to increase it through the years to 70mg.  Now the dr. will not let him go to a higher dose because that is the max and he does not want the liability if something happened.  My son now cannot stay awake through the day.  He literally is half asleep all day takes several naps and sleeps through the night.  The dr. tried Ritalin and Nuvigil (sp?) to keep him awake.  It was a disaster.  He became obsessed with surfing the internet and he started shuffling his feet, hunching his shoulders and squinting.  It was awful.  Vyvanse did not do that to him.  The dr. wants to start him on Adderal next.  I can't believe how hard it is to get him the help he needs.  Also, we pay out of pocket so this is a lot to deal with.  Any ideas on what we can do or how we can get the help he needs?  Thanks for any ideas, we are desperate.
