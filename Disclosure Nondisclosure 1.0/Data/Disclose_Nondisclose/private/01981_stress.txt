As posted earlier I have chronic sinusitus...taking antibiotics again for it after the ENT said my sinuses are infected...again...I also got a  DTP vaccine (Tetanu with 2 others) over a month or so back...shoulders hurt from being strained from work...lifting ladders and painting and scraping homes...some of them 50ft high and at times raising them by myself and not that long ago...also use to work out and damaged the shoulders from overuse...havent worked out seriously in a few years now at 44 years old.So for the past month and a half I have these achy armpits...I went to the docs twice...he found no swelling and nothing abnormal after feeling my neck and underarms...no fever...no swelling...Is this strain and me having health anxiety making me feel this?I asked for blood work and he said to wait as it will show the sinus infection and to finish the antibiotics....he attributes it to the sinus infection...damn this deviated septum...I have been having these since last labor day(the sinuses).thanks for any suggestions.
