6 months ago my toenails and the skin around them started hurting I went too a podiatrist and he cut out ingrown toenails on both great toes and said all my toenails where ingrown I took a week after surgery before I could walk and my toenails still don't look that great then a sore appeared on the outside of my nose about a 5 months ago went to the doctor he thought it was a spider bite also did a wound culture and prescribed keflex, the nurse called a day later and said wound culture was positive and they needed to change my medicine to Bactrim completed  medicine my nose was healing soon as meds where gone sore came back with a vengeance. Then I wake up one morning with huge knot on the back of my head, so I go too the ER they refer me too a surgeon when I see the surgeon he says I need surgery that it is a pilar cyst that had ruptured my head felt so tight and the back of my neck was very tight I had the surgery and thought I would wake up with all the tightness gone it's been 3 months since surgery my scalp still feels tight I can take a comb and stretch the skin and it feels great but it doesn't solve the problem my ears also feel like the skin is pulled very tight . And I've figured out that doctor said I had ingrown toenails its overgrowth of cuticle it's happening on my fingernails also what should I do my scalp, neck, and ears are all I can think about its very uncomfortable the sore on nose is not as bad but it's still their and moved up around my eye one doctor treated me for mrsa and that did no good. I have never been sick I'm 50 year old female and the last 8 months have been a nightmare
