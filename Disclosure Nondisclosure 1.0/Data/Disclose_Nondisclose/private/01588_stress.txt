I am a 30 yr old female with a very irregular menstrual cycle.  About 2 and half months ago I had sexual intercourse with a very large man.  When we finished I noticed I was spotting.  Nothing too uncommon I know.  Then about a week later I began too bleed.  I had many blood clots yet it wasn't a heavy bleeding.  This lasted 60 stressful days.  Some days lighter than others.  Now I failed to mention that I received news about a week after this bleeding started that my friend was diagnosed with HIV.  My stress level hit the roof since I had recently had unprotected sex and was tested that very morning.  And of course you have to wait nearly a week to get your results.  I have since been to the doctor, had a pap, all was clear, no std's, no hpv, blood tests were all negative (I was tested for Hep A and B, Tuberculosis, HIV, STD's, and anything you could possibly receive in another country.  All negative so my stress level has since been down.  My doctor believes this bleeding has to do with stress.  So it's been about 8 days that I haven't bled.  Well yesterday I went to the bathroom and sure enough there was blood.  I am just looking for a second opinion.  Is this stress???  I am traveling out of the country again in 2 weeks and have been quite anxious but not stressed.  Just looking for some advice/diagnosis to this mysterious bleeding.  Thanks to anyone that responds.  One more thing, I am not pregnant and I did not miscarry.
