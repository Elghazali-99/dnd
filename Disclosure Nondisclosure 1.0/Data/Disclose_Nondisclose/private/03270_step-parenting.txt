So the boys ages 10 and 11 have been abandoned by their mother going on 7 years and have had a live in gf they called mom for 4 years but that was 3 years ago...and now I have been with dad for 1.5 years...here is the thing the kids have bad manners, poor social skills, aggressive behavior, no home routine with dinner homework showers video game limits. They are rude at social gatherings even to their own very limited friends *like 2 friends* they dont have hobbies or interests other than video games....one kid is 10 going on 5 years old her cries daily throws fits wants to ALWAYS be around his dad even when he has friends near him to be with he will literally hold his dads shoulder to keep him near....its awkward and people have noticed and commented on their lack of cleanliness or manners or that they are overweight and have no interests outside the home....I dont blame them I feel they are a product of their environment their dad is lazy in my opinion and doesnt do enough for them to get out and play and develop interests or new friends, he doesnt have a schedule in place that is healthy or proper family time I feel he should do more quality time than just watching tv with them or being near them...since ive been with him I've encouraged outside activities family time game night movie night going out fun experiences even a disneyland trip to which they were very ungrateful for and seemed to think they deserved more than one day at disneyland and really anything we or I do for them they take for granted like its owed to them. He buys them things clothes video games game cards whenever they want because he wants to keep them happy I disagree with that they are to be earned....he'll try for a month or so and slip back into habits of co-sleeping the kid just "falls" asleep in his bed of course watching TV late...since I've been with him they have actually had a bedtime in their beds learned to say thank you and the fits have gone DOWN to simple crying & pouting vs. the roll on the floor slam doors scream for HOURS fits that were a 2-4 times weekly occurrence....the brothers can't stand each other one is rude mean and spiteful *(which I think is just alot of emotions from abandonment) the other is ANNOYING AF literally anyone around him can attest that even though he means well he is annoying, pest-like, bothersome and has no idea of adult boundaries he will often sit or stand next to his dad and stare at whoever his dad is speaking with and put his hand on his dad as if to show dominance his dad recently found an issue with it but as it turns out this child has ALWAYS been this way...(from friends of mine who knew them prior) ...
 my question in saying all this my boyfriends needs ALOT of help to be a parent that is involved, loving and is raising kids to be kind  to be healthy  and mentally and emotionally strong people with goals in life. His parents SUCKED and still do and they live with him (depend on him)...Ive tried to help Ive gone out of my way to help and they have made great strides and even gone to therapy which helped a ton ease the tension and another adult telling them respectful behavior is expected of a child. His parents dont help he still lives with them hasnt moved out although Ive directly and indirectly said it many times...I know I can stay and help him get the backbone and confidence to move out and be a better parent...but should I?
 Im seven years younger and with no children...Ive worked professionally and voluntarily with kids from many backgrounds and I have a great skillset to help them and their dad is a wonderful man with a great heart for them and people and tries as best he knows how but he wasnt raised right and things just werent shown to him or come as instinct for him...should I stay? what are reasonable benchmarks for him...move out? establish your own home?
