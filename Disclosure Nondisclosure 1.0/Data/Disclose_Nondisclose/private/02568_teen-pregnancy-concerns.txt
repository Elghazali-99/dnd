I have been on ortho tricyclen lo for a while now. I started sometime late last year but it has been more than 3 months on it... Every now and then I do forget to take a pill but I make sure to take them the next day. The last one I missed was on Thursday because I ran out of the pack which is for 28 days. I did get the pack refilled the next day and take two. Just yesterday, (4/6/14) I was laying down with my boyfriend and we were back to front, my back being to his front. We did not have pants on and we were humping a little but no actual sex. He told me he was ejaculating so I moved very quickly to prevent any getting near my vagina. As soon as he stopped, I pulled my pants up (while I was away from him) and went to the bathroom where I took a washcloth and dabbed my vagina and butt to get any off if there was any to begin with but I did not feel any.. I did place toilet paper in my underwear to dry up any semen and to prevent anything from getting inside me. Today I have not had fatigue, unusual breast tenderness, or cramps. But my lower abdomen has been very tight and I have had more burping (small burps), gas (not unusual with the breakfast food I ate), and my stomach has been making strange noises/feels odd. I am also very worried about the chance of pregnancy and I believe nerves have a play in all of this too. Please, let me know what you think about the situation, how to handle it, and should I take an emergency contraceptive? Thank you!
