I have recently ended a long relationship due to discoveries of cheating, lying about everything one can think of, manipulation, poss drug use, money, etc.  Basically an entire world of lies finally uncovered.  This is a man who manipulates in a very skilled manner, takes aderol for ADD, minor stealing incidents as a teen, can't hold a job for long periods of time, and never has money though he currently makes a lot.  He doesn't have violent tendencies nor run-ins with the law.  I was wondering if he fell into the Antisocial Personality Disorder or if it was something else.  I would also like your opinion on if i should take steps to protect myself.  I feel that he is a coward (when confronted he literally ran) but I completely exposed him.  I was the one to finally figure it out and he lost not only me but another woman, friends, etc.  This was simply the way events unravelled, but I need to know if I should consider myself to be in danger. Thank you so much for your time.
