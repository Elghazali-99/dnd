I'm a seventeen-year-old girl, and for some ungodly reason I'm dreading the day I turn eighteen. I know I miss school so much, my junior year was amazing, containing wonderful teachers and friends along with a schedule I didn't detest, and I wish I had one more week left of it. Now I'm moving on to my senior year, my LAST year of high school. Then I'm off to the real world... Yikes. I'm excited, but mostly upset because in all honesty, I love the perks of being "just a kid" as well as having the responsibilities of an adult. I love being a young adult, but I also admire being a kid. Which sounds really flaky, now that I think about it. I know what I want to do with my life, I just need support. I don't know as much as I should, and that pertains to driving and navigating around unfamiliar localities, and finances. I think I'm a loser for what I don't (but should) have provided, at my age. I'll be eighteen in November and I know how time passes so quickly, it drives me insane usually. I'm a ponderer, and I dwell on the past, the wonderful moments. I don't know what's to come for me, I know for a fact I won't have much together by the end of senior year. I don't know what to think, I don't know how to feel.
