I'm a 23 year old, female. Two days ago, I noticed a small bump on the left side of my neck the size of a jelly bean, about two inches below my ear, and two inches back. It wasn't painful and I figured it was a swollen lymph node. The same day, I noticed my left leg sporadically going numb but I didn't connect the two. The next day, the bump was swollen to about the size of a quarter and a few other things appeared. Right in front of my ear, I have a huge sore spot now but no visible or physical "bumps." The pain isn't inside my ear. I also noticed my left arm was going numb and it hurt to have my arm bent. By hurt, I mean, tenderness in the nerves, kind of like restless leg. Also, the side of my head is shaved for style, but I noticed a rash/small bumps above my ear, almost behind it that are also very painful. Last night I couldn't sleep because of all the pain.
 Today is the third day, and now my jaw hurts. The side of my head is throbbing. I can't move my neck very well. I'm really scared... 
 All of this is on the left side of my body. I have no new cuts that could contribute to an infection. I haven't burned myself in the past two weeks. I thought that it could be stress because a close friend of mine just died, but I don't believe this could be stress related. 
 Help?
