I am a 46 yr old female. As an adult women in my 20's i beagan to notice an unhealthy relationship w my mother. As a young child and teenager she would make me feel guilty if i did things with my friends.. Because she would be home alone. Committs like "u dont luv me if u go.. And .. "you promised me u would never get married"... Became common. As i grew older i began to remember more incidents that she pulled. She does nothing but talk about herself. She shows no interest in my life. It is all about what i "owe it to her" and " what i did for you when u were little". When i try to tell her something she said hurt me, she wont let me get a word in! She just rambles and all i can hear is her insults! I am a very settled and resp. Adult. Yet she treats me like a " horrable" person. It just gets worse every year. The only way to have a relationship is to do it ALL on her terms! I feel like it is time to stay away. I did this once before..it is sad and depressing that i do not Feel like i have a Mother...thanks for letting me vent...
