So thankful for all the wonderful advice here.  I am happy and am managing to work with my ex in our business.  I have had a couple of blips of sending 'I miss you' messages but that is behind me.  What really helped was I have some friends who are doing some work for our business and as they get to know him their insite into what a bitter and angry man he is has been enlightening.  
 I joined an on-line dating site and had a couple of coffee meetings that went nowhere, met one guy who insisted he was in love with me and asked me to marry him on the first date, and just recently started seeing a truly good man.  He actually used to work where I did and went to school with my ex/business partner.  He loves his family, his parents had a good marriage, he isn't bitter towards his ex-wife, has a good job, has a good relationship with his kids and is very kind and considerate.  The sparks haven't gone off for me yet but I am enjoying the dating and getting to know him before we bring in the physical relationship.  I feel blessed.
