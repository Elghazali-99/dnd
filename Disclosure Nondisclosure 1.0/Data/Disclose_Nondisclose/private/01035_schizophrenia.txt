since about the end of second grade ive been severely depressed since about 4th grade ive seen bugs now im 17 an a half my depression is slowly, getting slightly better as i dont feel like dying anymore...since 5th grade iv had severe anxiety since 9th grade ive had really bad panic attacks although they are getting better. in 3rd grade my mind created another identity to shield me from how cruel the entire school was to me everyone hated me everyone always hated me i would get made fun of and shoved pushed to the ground even though the only thing to make fun of me for was...i love horses its my life i cant live with out them many times the only reason i didnt kill myself was it wouldnt be fair to my horse he might get abused again i cant let that happen i have to stay alive until he dies then i can kill myself...HORSE GIRL WHAT A WEIRDO!!!! HAHAHA *shove* thats how its been my whole life till i shut my mouth in high school then i met a guy i really liked found out he was a coke addict then he raped me and beat me for 2 an a half months straight at school one time beating me until i passed out and leaving me naked on the boys bathroom floor...somehow noone found me he told me if i told he would cut me so i said nothing until 6 months after he one day disappeared this was during the end of my freshman year back to the identity thing though she got stronger in 7th grade when she started to fight me to take over but never really did until a couple of months ago she got so strong she keeps coming in and taking me over she hates my current boyfriend with a burning passion so much so that now when she takes over she wont speak to him my jaw just clamps shell grind my teeth till my jaw hurts and she also makes my eyes feel like theyre popping out of my head she doesnt blink i also am very paranoid about stuff like im always peeking around corners there IS always someone watching me even when im locked in bathroom with the window completely covered some has bugged my room there are secret cameras somewhere and microphones all over my room so they can hear and see everything im doing i thought i had myself figured out i thought i had dissociative identity disorder because of her and when she takes me over but my therapist said i wouldnt be aware of when she takes over but i fight her for control over me but i do have a really bad memory...for example ill be aware im doing something at the moment and the next day have no memory of doing that what does all this look like 
btw now i see hear and feel bugs crawling on me see flashes of light smell things that noone else smells and see a guy dressed in a black trench coat a black cowboy hat with black boots black belt with a shiny buckle and a black shirt but i can never see his face all on random occasions throughout the day although bugs and flashes are all day the guy only comes out at night and so the other personality and depression but anxiety is all day as well 
i have been to 3 therapists first one to talk to he said i needed depression meds so he sent me to this other guy just to get meds guy #2 said that sounds good and put me on zoloft i hated it it made me so numb i hate being numb its the worst thats when cutting and more suicidal thoughts kept getting worse so i stopped taking it a month or so later my panic attacks got so bad i'd wind up only being a school for a couple hours a week i get there freak out and go home so i said to guy 1 PANIC ATTACKS  are getting so bad im so nervous my head is flying everywhere something has to change now i cant live like this any more help me what do i do and he sent me back to guy 2 for anti anxiety pills guy 2 said take ativan so im still taking it after a couple years now it helps a little my mom wont let me get a higher dosage but i think it would help but then i got so paranoid that guy 1 was secretly talking to my mom and telling her everything i said every detail and that somehow she knew everything i was doing who i was texting and calling i thought she knew i was raped cause she saw all my messages and listened to all my calls i still KNOW to this day that cops are monitoring my life watching me listing in i know my phone is bugged but i just dont care anymore iv learned to live with it my whole life i have KNOWN cops are fallowing me watching and listing to everything i do and say but back to therapists so i stopped going back to guy 1 and 2 and stayed on ativan but then everything got worse in my head i know theres someone else inside me because im a very calm person i never hold grudges i often say if they dont like thats theyre problem not mine im me if you dont like me to bad for you i never get mad its just not me i only get sad or maybe i should say sadder idk  but never have i been a mad or violent person i refuse to argue even if i know im right and what theyre saying makes no sense ill just agree because i dont want to fight id much rather just drop it and move on with life but when she takes over everything is mean angry she loves to fight every word said and she hates everything i hate her i just wish she would get out of me i hate having two mes shes so evil she hates me i hate her but i think she feeds on the hate i have towards her and how she is i call her "B!tch" because shes just so EVIL sorry i keep getting off topic but i feel the need to explain everything so...i got a new psychiatrist this time hes nice i like him iv only seen him a couple times so far but i look forward to each time and hope he has a answer for what the hell is going on in my head i just want the answer i want a label what am i??? he put me on seroquel (i think thats how to spell it) 25mg did nothing now im on 50 and still nothing nothing has changed for better or worse just i am sleeping a little bit better but it does not help me fall asleep it might even make it harder to fall asleep but it keeps me asleep once i finally do fall asleep so i have been to therapy and gotten over things but i do have a history of depressioin anxiety cutting suicide thoughts and a few attempts iv also done a long list of drugs but never been addicted to anything except cigarettes they help chill me out a little i usually get bored with everything pretty quick and recently i quit everything except what im prescribed and cigs because i really just want to be normal i mean not normal because i think being normal is boring but i just dont want to be crazy any more seeing hearing and feeling things on me that arent there is getting really old im tired of it...o ya and i dropped out of high school at the end of last year but now i have my GED and have a job at my parents store. 
what does this sound like??? any suggestions are helpful
