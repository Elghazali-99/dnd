Hi, I am 49 yrs old, I have no memories of any of my brother or sisters living at home, I am #5 of six children, I remember things growing up outside of the home but not at home until the age of about 15yrs.  My younger brother also has the same problem, it's as though I was plonked on the earth at around 15 - 16yrs old.  I can't remember ages of my siblings or the age I was when my mum died (about 11 - 12 yrs of age), I was severly sexually abused by lots of people as a child and physically abused.  I dissociate a lot, cut myself, see things in black and white (no grey areas) but am learning. I have very low self esteem and see myself as bad, I also have had only two relationships (never dated any other people) and I married them both, both were/are abusive, but I am still married after 22yrs to the second person and are working on the relationship,  Work I have a hard time, people tend to bully me as I do not retaliate, I am very scared of people and don't have friends, at the moment I am not working and keep myself isolated.
Can you pls. tell me what you think my problem is, if any I don't want to believe I have DID, or anything else, I would like to think that I am just weak, maybe seeking attention or something.  I have been in therapy for about 15yrs and although I try hard and function pretty well most of the time, I don't seem to get any better. I look forward to you comments.
 Kind regards,
 Maureen
