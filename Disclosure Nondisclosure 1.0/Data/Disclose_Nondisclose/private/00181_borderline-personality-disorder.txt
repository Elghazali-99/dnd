I am twenty one years old and recently found out my dad is a psychopath. He is a severe pathological liar. He manipulated and plays mind games. It is like he has no emotion anymore. The sad part is that i was very close to him as a child. Only until recently has he started to get much worse. He had the biggest heart and he cared about everybody in his life. Now he takes advantage of everybody.  He takes advantage of his parents,friends,and family. He lies all the time and never takes responsibility for anything. Everything revolves around him and only him. If a family member is sick he just thinks the world is out to get him. He tries to get reactions from people by doing the most inconsiderate things. He is happy when his family is miserable. Almost like he thrives on it.
 In the past couple of years his outward appearance has changed. He looks gaunt but walks with arrogance. He makes weird angry faces when he is thinking or talking to you. And he smells really bad! It is like the dad I knew and loved is a complete stranger! I keep thinking things will change but it doesn't. The only communication I have with him right now is through email. Even in his emails he takes every chance he has to talk about himself and how hard it is for him. What about his daughter who has treated worse then dirt? All I get is fake sorry's and I will never do it again. Then shortly after the emotional and mental abuse starts all over again.
 I just really miss my old dad but maybe I have to realize that this is who he is and move on. It also has been very hard for my mom. But she realized this a lot earlier then I did. When I ask her does he even love me anymore? She says he loves you in the only way he knows how. But I believe that these days he does not know how to love and I can't make him try and care if he doesn't. What should I do?
