So I am 17 and about 2 weeks ago I decided to try snus it's like Swedish tobacco, but I tried it 2 times the first day, 1 or 2 the second day, I think one the day after that and then 2 more like 4 or 5 days later which was like a week ago from today, a few days after the last time I tried it I noticed what felt like a decent sized gash like hole in the side of my cheek and right above it like connected to it was like a hardish part. It hurt like burned/stung pretty bad when I touched it and it was hard no to because it's right next to my top maulers on me cheep. It is probably like a centimeter  long and a little shorter tall, it's now about 5-7 days later and it seems to be healing up, it has a white thing on the top its a little red and has a tiny like hole like crack along it below it, it barely hurts any more but it's kinda hardened up and it sticks out. I looked up what it could be and saw stuff about oral cancer and around that time I have noticed like a tiny bit of jaw/ear pain but that could just be caused by me worrying about it because I have bad anxiety and can't stop thinking I have cancer now. 
  I am not going to use tobacco anymore, is it possible that cancer like that has developed in such a short time, is this cancer and what should I do, the last thing I want to do is tell me parents so I need to be sure, I have also seemed to talk myself into thinking I feel like something is stuck in my throat but I can't tell if that is anxiety or not. Thanks for reading!
