I was diagnosed with (MDD) but not as severe yet but if left untreated it will get worse. I didn't even know I had this actually. My roommate already kicked me out, parents cannot stand me. 
 There will be episodes where I will tear up for no apparent reason and I'm a guy which is just preposterous. Other times it's just a numb/nothingness feeling and this tends to go back and forth and could i understand if there was a reason to but there is not. In fact, I had a job, a steady girl, then gradually over the course of a year, started feeling this darkness/sinking feeling and resulted in getting fired etc..But I don't really care anyway. I just don't want them to feel agitated or harm their health because of me. Also the last thing I want is for people to think I'm begging for their attention. I just want them to understand what's going on. When I tell them I'm depressed, they just don't get it. Sometimes I think it's better to just put on that fake smile and pretend everything is great, but for me that just triggers headaches/ aches/pains. Has anyone gone through this?
