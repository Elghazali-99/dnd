when i entered this thread, i had no idea what bpd was, but when i started reading some posts, i started to realize that i have some similarities to these people suffering from this disorder. Not only do i have a series of rituals that i follow for reasons that i can't explain, but i seem to have different personalities. Theres my normal self, and then theres another side of me. For example, when I'm with friends, i have a tendency to put on this strange voice, and i feel like im doing it to hide my emotions from them, because i fear that they can see through me. Even with my family, i feel like i need to put on this voice because its the only way i can open up without being judged. i put on this voice when i feel like people that im comfortable with are judging me, and i tend to do it when i feel like they are mad at me or are not liking me for whatever reason. i also get furious with people even if they haven't done anything to me, usually just because they look or dress a certain way, and i hate it but i cant control it. is there anything wrong with me?
