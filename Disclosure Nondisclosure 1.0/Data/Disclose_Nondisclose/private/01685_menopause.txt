I received the call today - tests came back okay, but the hormone levels are off. You should not be bleeding.  We are going to do an ultrasound, then also an endometrial biopsy. There is a family history from both sides, of ovarian and cervical cancer...I get checked annually.  This time, they have me scared.  My Maternal Grandmother made it to 83 with only missing periods when she was pregnant.  But my mom had a totally hysterectomy at the age of 27 due to cervical cancer.
 My periods have gotten out of sync and exceptionally painful, the last year. I have been having hot flashes about two years. The memory thing, mood swings, and insomnia, we cannot judge for I have a TBI and PTSD from injuries I sustained when I was in the military. But I have only missed one period.
 A doctor, last August, wanted to put me on birth control pills for three months to try to stop my periods. I tried it. It did not work. Now I'm being told I am actually in menopause but my body forgot to quit bleeding?  I am scared. My Paternal Grandmother died from cervical cancer and breast cancer, when I was little (might have actually been the same cancer, you are talking the early 60s).
 Any thoughts, suggestions, ideas.  I have no sisters, only brothers, sons...husband...but they don't talk girl stuff.  Help. Please.
