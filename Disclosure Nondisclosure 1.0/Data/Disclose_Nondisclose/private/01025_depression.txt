I've lately begun working out and I've noticed that I've lost a lot of weight in the past year. Both of my parents are overweight, and our family has had a history of obesity, so this is a bit unusual for them. I have a brother who a little underweight, but he has been so his whole life so apparently my parents have nothing wrong with this. It's just that lately they've decided that I was anorexic. I've never starved myself, never binged, never purged, and have never even had the notion of becoming skinnier or losing weight. I just wanted to work out and if I became skinnier that was just an extra plus. I couldn't feel more healthy than I do now. Anyway, they've literally been trying to fatten me up with pizza, cupcakes, chocolate, cheesy pastas, and just about every carb and sugar induced food possible. They've also convinced everyone we know that I'm anorexic and that I'm not eating enough. Unfortunately, a lot of our overweight relatives live nearby and they constantly ask me if I've eaten enough yet. I'm sick and tired of constantly eating and I've noticed they've never done this to my brother before. I'll admit, I've gained about a pound this past month, but I'm not sure how long this will continue and everytime I eat something gross and fattening that I know is really bad for me (today it was two Big Macs for breakfast and a side of fries and milkshakes :/) I just feel worse and worse. Help???
