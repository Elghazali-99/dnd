I have GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and I have ALL the symptoms, and I mean ALL
But this is my mental symptoms:
-I feel negative when I'm anxious.. I feel like anything can go wrong
-I feel like there's no help for me ... Feel hopeless..
-Hard to sleep, always worries
-Afraid that my panic attack will strike me again..my brain keeps thinking ''becareful...anytime now..''
-Emotional breakdown..feel like crying..upset.. 
-Afraid that if I'm happy, the worry feeling going to strike me again..
-Mood swings..
-Lose interest of doing things I enjoyed (sometimes)
 But all of these go away when i take my medication (xanax)
I KNOW these are some of the symptoms of depression, HOWEVER I'm 90% sure that I'm not depressed. I have goals in my life, I have my dreams, I have hopes and faith in God.
 Do u guys understand me?
Oh and the main thing:
- I always want people to be sympathetic.. I want people to understand me.. and care for me..
 I just had a panic attack that's why I'm writing this.. my ''dark thoughts'' are striking me now and I'm so negative right now =(
