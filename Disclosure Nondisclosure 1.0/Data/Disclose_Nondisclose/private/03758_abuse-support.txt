I am 19 years old and in the process of getting a divorce. My husband and I had dated and lived together for several months before getting married. He never showed any signs that he would become abusive. After we  got married he did a complete 180. It was like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. At first I thought it was something I did, but then I found out about his girlfriend. when I confronted him about it, after he had been gone for several days at her house, he grabbed me by my throat, slamming me against the wall. He was screaming in my face telling me never to question him again, that he'd kill me if I ever told, etc.. I stayed quiet and took the heightened level of abuse for several weeks after that. Partially out of fear and partially because I still loved him completely. One night he had gone off to be with her and I ran away. I have nightmares about him and can't go in public for fear of seeing him. I still feel guilty for leaving and I still love him. I'll never go back though. Is it normal to feel this way about someone who terrorized you? Does the fear ever go away?
