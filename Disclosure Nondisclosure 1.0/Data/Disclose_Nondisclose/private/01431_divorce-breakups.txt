Im gay and my boyfriend is bisexual. He prefers having a gay relationship. However, he is diagnosed Bipolar. As a little boy he lived in several foster care homes as his mother abandoned him at 7 yrs. old. We met through the internet while he was in jail and wrote more than a hundred letters to each other. I live in Texas and he lives in Kentucky. After he was paroled we visited each other several times for a few days and seemed to hit it off. 
He said he loved me and I felt the same way. He has no problem with fidelity. However, he recently moved in (about three weeks ago) with me in Texas and it has been a rollercoaster of a ride. I do everything to please and help him and love him. Its difficult for him to display emotion and says its due to walls he built to protect himself. He became friends with my neighbors in my apartment complex and now likes to spend 10 to 12 hours with them playing video games and running errands with them saying he needs friends. He spends few hours with me and he continues to say he loves me. We are intimate and have no problems in that area. Although he is not addicted to drugs there has been a few times he drank and gets verbally abusive and has anger issues. He says he moved 2000 miles from his hometown to be with me to prove his love for me. I am a 54 yr. old gay man and he is 36 yrs. old. he keeps saying that it does not matter to him. As he had a relationship with a 53 yr. old man when he was 18 yrs. old. He is not taking his Seroquel on a regular basis. I don't think this is working out even though I really do love him. Can anyone shed some light to help me out on my situation?
