Here's my history:
 I have struggled with depression on and off since my early 20s. About 18 months ago I "gave in" & agreed to try medication.  My MD put me on Wellbutrin XL & I responded well in most areas, but saw an increase in irritability & anxiety.  She then added Zoloft & that eliminated the new symptoms, but I started feeling shaky, lazy & sleepy all the time.  I gained 25 pounds, putting me at my heaviest weight EVER. I wasn't depressed or anxious anymore, but I have ALWAYS been an active athlete & my interest in my favorite activities dwindled.  In May my MD started weaning me off the Zoloft & in October I discontinued its use completely.  I didn't feel like sleeping all the time anymore & my career focus improved, but my irritability, short fuse & anxiety also returned.  My motivation has not returned, my desire to interact much socially with friends has decreased & I still have a lack of interest in activities.
 I do not think the Wellbutrin XL is working for me as well anymore & obviously WBXL by itself has never been the solution.  The Zoloft made me lazy, lethargic & fat.  The letargy has affected my weight, my health & my career. 
 Prozac apprears to target all of my areas of concern & sounds like it's worth a try, but it is in the same family as the Zoloft & I worry about the energy/motivational issues.  It also seems that there is a lot of buzz about Effexor, but there seem to be more reports of negative side effects with this.  
 I have an apt with my MD next week, but would like to go in prepared to intelligently discuss options. Advice?
