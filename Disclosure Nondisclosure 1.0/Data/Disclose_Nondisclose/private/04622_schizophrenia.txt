Hello, the past few months have been a blur for me. I am 19. I have always been more introverted but lately I am always thinking, and my attention span in college is non existant. I don't know if I had a mental breakdown or something but most of my craziness started when I thought I was molested. I became suspicious of everyone in my family, I was convinced my uncle did it, then i thought my dad then my mom. Before that I always imagined ways that I could die, or i always would think I had something wrong with me. I am also very paranoid. if people are talking in the room next to me and i can't hear them clearly i actually hear them talking about me when i dont think they really are. at night i cant sleep because I am convinced people are outside smashing my car windows whenever I hear noise. Whenever I put music on in my car I tune it out, i swear its like I put a song on and 2 seconds later the song is over. I am not suicidal but I wouldn't care if I died. I have no motivation to do anything, I don't feel depressed and I don't feel happy. I just don't know whats wrong.
 This all started a few months ago and since then my life has been a blur, everyday the same things happen and nothing changes.
