I have been prown to the odd hallucinations, mostly shaddows and the like when i'm on the edge. 
But last night was the worst, I had bugs all over my bed and it really creeped me out. Atleast 3 attacks of it bearly a few minutes between. I tried to keep as calm as possible, and my partner was with me talking with me hugging me and reassuring me that it wasn't real but it was soo hard. Soo vivid and I was in soo much terror. 
I have never had such a vivid hallucination of these creatures. 
I really don't why or how it could have gotten soo bad. 
It's never been soo bad. 
I've been paranoid for years and it comes and goes, past few weeks its been a lot worse again. And I think it might be linked somehow. I feel like someone/people are watching me constantly. Since I was young its the way its been but its become more to the front of my mind again. Having to fall asleep with lights on (we had tealights on last night but it just ment i saw the bugs worse). Having to close the blinds because I see a red light on the satelite thing and I know people are watching. 
 I don't think I'm mad but the hallucination of bugs makes me doubt myself. 
 (I've been stressed out due to our neighbour being a theaf and police being involved and such with my partner as gifts she had bought for me were taken by him and we found out yesterday, i dont know if its just stress.. ive never been soo out of my head.) 
 Someone know what to do. is it to do with bpd? i talked once about it at the mental hospital but they just passed by it with no regard(when it was just the shaddows)
