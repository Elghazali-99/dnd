I have had issues with my 2 adult stepchildren since marrying their father 9 years ago.  At the time, the kids were 17 and 20 respectively. I helped to raise the younger son, and he refuses to speak to me since we moved to Hawaii five years ago.  He acts like I don't exist.  The mother died 13 years ago.  The daughter, who has since married and has 2 children, treats me with indifference. We give them gifts and Dad is the only one who gets thanked.  Birthdays aren't much better...mine are basically ignored while Dad gets the treatment from the grandkids (phone calls, cards etc)  There are things that have happened that I don't want to go into, but this treatment is very hurtful for me.  I have tried my best to be nice and include them in everything.  The son, who has never said thank you once, used to call and wish me Happy Birthday and Mother's Day, but since we moved, he basically told Dad he had to pick between him or me.  I don't know how I am supposed to act.....I don't want to participate anymore as I feel they are controlling the situation and let me in when they want and push me out when they want.  I feel I am setting myself up for getting hurt if I allow myself to get close to them or their kids.  I don't have kids of my own and basically feel that it best I just let them go and not get sucked into the situations.  Any advice?
