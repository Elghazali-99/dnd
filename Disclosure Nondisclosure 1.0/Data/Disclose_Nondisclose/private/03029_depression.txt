why do i have such horrible thoughts about hurting my loved ones??? it ***** it makes me feel not worthy of anything...it is horrible i cant look my family in the eye because i feel guilty...im a 18yr old male i have been struggling with anxiety and depression for around 4 months....i have gone to therapy but yesterday i had a vision of me hurting my little brother and it just crushed me....he is 14 and sometimes crashes in the same room..
 he was asleep and i looked at him and i had a horrrible image of me hurting him....i started thinking and i feel so scared that he can be in danger around me?? idk if its my fears and anxiety or if im going crazy....for highschool i moved in with my aunt and when i was a junior and senior my little brother moved in with me at my aunts...i wouldnt see my mom, dad or my other older bro and sis...i would only see him everday.. i would take care of him make sure he was never hungry and looking over him so i kind of have a special bond with him...and to have thoughts of me hurting him drives me crazy, i at times find my self questioning the love i have for him but idk why....i want to just break down and cry when i see him it hits me deep.....im sorry this is long but i needed to say what i am feeling rite  now to someone please give me some input on what you guys think i should do??
