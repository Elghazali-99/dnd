HI,
I was diagnosed when I was 28 after having eating disorder therapy for binge eating related obesity.
 I had been actively BPD since about the age of 16 as a result of severe abuse as a kid.  Its a coping mechanism for me and a way of splitting between child and adult.
 I had major issue with agression and anger yet im a high functioning person and my perfectionist attitude actually worked for me.  I got married at age 21 and held down jobs and relationships fine but had very volatile relationship all the same.  At times I was physically abusive to my husband and verbally all the time.
 I found I never really got better till I was put on antidepressants at the age of 28 and only then I felt ready to tackle it head on.  
 When I was 33 I started seeing a gestalt therapist and after a month of seeing her I found out I was pregnant (we had been tryng 11 yrs!)  a lot of my BPD stemmed from poor mothering as a child so being pregnant raise a lot of issue about how I would cope as a mother, would I repeat the same abusive neglect my own mother gave me etc.
 My pregnancy helped me further to get well as it brought out issues I could finally deal with and my therapist helped me also.  I found gestalt the best therapy for me as it gently encouraged integration of my personality.  I felt secure and was in a place I could express myself that was safe and non judgemental.  My therapist was loving and nurturing which were a major part of my recovery.
 Now at nearly 36 I have had a second child and no longer feel the control of BPD and rarely have splits!  I still am a highly strung sort of personality and sometimes have a black and white dogmatic view but over all I have great relationships now and feel content to be finally an adult.
 I hope this helps others to see there can be stability and happiness after years of BPD
