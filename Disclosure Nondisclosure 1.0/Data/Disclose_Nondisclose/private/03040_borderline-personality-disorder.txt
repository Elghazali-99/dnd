I, lately, have been terrified that I have Borderline Personality Disorder. My Girl Friend, about three months ago, left me after I found she was cheating on me.  I had known, but too scared to confront and confirm, for a while prior.  I have been dissecting the relationship (which was excellent up until November), and have blamed myself for everything, and diagnosed myself with every scary mental illness.  The Borderline is the scariest (mainly because of books like Walking on Egg Shells.)   I have been feeling extremely bad since the breakup.  It has quite totally devastated me, and I feel extremely alone, and unlovable.  I have been diagnosed with sever clinical depression, that has for years been in “remission.”
I am very worried that I have this, and (in advance of my impending therapist visit) wanted to see if this is something that I should worry about.  I am mostly worried that I was this when I was with her, and caused her life to be awful.  I was feeling sad, lonely, needy, and clingy because my friends moved away, I was living with her but she was extremely busy with work and seemed to neglect me, and because I was working three jobs, but could not find a full time teaching job.
I can accept criticism easily (I guess because I am far worse on myself.)
I don’t engage in risky behavior
I have been feeling extremely suicidal, and (both currently and in the past) engaged in self-injury.
I have been feeling anger, but mostly towards myself, but it’s not uncontrollable.
I feel alone, worthless, full of self-loathing.
I am pretty in control of my emotions; at least I can hide them well when in public. 
I have been afraid my close friends (the ones I was brave enough to tell about this loss) hate me and are going to leave me.  As a result, I apologize frequently and I guess tried to make sure they don’t leave. 
I’m just so lonely, sad, and scared of losing everything.
Sorry this was hard to read, and annoying.
Thank You
