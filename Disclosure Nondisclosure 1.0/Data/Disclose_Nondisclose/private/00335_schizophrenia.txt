Some of you folks will know me by the name Freebird. Well this story isn't about me......It is my grandson Kendal. From the time he was born Kendal has suffered many symptoms that overlap........His first diag. was oppositional defiance disorder~~laugh out loud AGE 4. ...........So from 4-10 asburgers,... with obvious tics .He was on Tennex2mg. and Topomax.... In 08 A cyst was found in his Temporal lobe. So at Duke Medicial in NC her underwent Brain Surgery. He had a year woth of scans and home monitoring devices to detect seizures......before the operation..... OK fast forward... Kendal is still ticking, having major social skill problems...........basicially friendless..............Fast forward again. Kendal is 13 Off the Tennex and topomax tics have but all gone away.......and addressing his low level aggitation and violent outburst (most always at home) 8 months ago he was put on Abilify 10 mg. since then he has gotten worse.............his behavior is out of controll. Not only is he homicidal ..( inflicting serious harm to silbings-throwing mother to the floor) he has also put a knife to his throat and threatened to cut his throat during his remorseful times.....................and new to the mix is inappropriate sexual behavior.....Kendal has exposed his private parts at the bus stop and at school............he was suspended last year......Present. This new sexual impulses is so far out of character for Kendal that now I am thinking it is the Abilify side effect...........My daughter is done with the nuerologist and done with Asburgers.............and is considering a evaulation at Holly Hill Hospital............perhaps in house. Kendal has never been diag. bi=polar or Schizophrenia. Even though it runs in the family.............Those who know me.......you do realize this is the tip of the iceburge..... My daughter says that right before Kendal goes into a rage... His Whole Afflect Changes. including his facial features and the tone of his voice.... afterwards he shows great remorse and cries and says he doesn't understand why he does it..............including exposing himself............He is spending the summer with his dad in West Va. and talks to my daughter on a regular basis.............All of this was just dropped in my lap less than a week ago... I am a very stong woman and I am a problem solver.. I see this as a cry for help and I will move heaven and earth before I loose my grandson to mental illness when there is so much help out there.............I am bi polar with psychotic eposodies. I am stable on Kolopin and Seroquel...........Stable..............Kendal has told his mom that he is feeling better and please don't give up on him.............So I have put it out here for you to look at and ponder what your experience has been that would be helpful in understand Kendal and supporting him while he gets the help he needs.............Especially if any of you guys have had the same compulsive sexual behavior..........We are adults here so I can handle all mature conversation aroung this issue.....
