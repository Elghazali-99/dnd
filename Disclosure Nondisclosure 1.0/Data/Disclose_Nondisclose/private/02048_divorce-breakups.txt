I am married since 11 months. I hv always been an independent girl. been working since 10 yrs but for my marriage I left my job. my husband knew always that I m very particular bout my career but I didn't realise that I would be going to a very orthodox family where girls are not even allowed to move out of the house alone. my husband committed that he would allow me to work after marriage after I settle down in the new house but it didn't happen rather I was not being allowed to go to honey moon with my husband alone n so on. because of such an orthodox behaviour n domination of my mom in law I left the house after five months of my marriage things got to the verge of divorce. I stayed with my parents for about two months.  but then I realised that I  wantd to be with my husband for the rest of the years so I apologised n came back. byt nw the situations hav got worse. 
* now my mom in law has got cancer n chemotherapy is going so she treats me like a maid of the house. I cannot sit rest n sleep whenever I want to. just a slave.
* if I complain me n my husband fight alot he is really short tempered he abuses me shouts at me.
* he is a complete mommas boy never bothered about his wife. we never go for lunches dinner or movie outings. he just expect me to be at home n serve his mom whole day.
* I hv no personal life with my husband.  just a maid of the house. He does not realise that I hav left everything for him my education job career. In spite of knowing that I don’t hv any brother m thr only daughter of my parents so its only me who will serve my parents.  but we hav no understanding.  he always talks about his mom. her priorities her treatment her health etc .
* he is just not bothered about my dreams expectations n above all his mom. She is nothing less Dan a devil. While her treatment also she leaves no opportunity to humiliate me n insult me. 
I m just so fed up from all dis
 because I know I cannot live without him n evn he cannot so getting apart is not a good idea. finishing myself probably is.
plz help me.
