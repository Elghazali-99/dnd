I am 35 y.o. and my mother is schizophrenic. She hasn't always been this way, her condition seems to have worsened in the last few months and she's been making our lives miserable. I live with her and my father.
 Maybe my case is not as dramatic as many posted on this forum but it is very sad and I don't know what to do, this is all very new to me.
 My mother is 71 y.o. and she's constantly claiming she sees shadows, gangs of criminals and creatures at night. She accuses everyone around her, everyone is plotting to hurt her and our pets - we live in a small farm, even though we're not far from the city centre, and we have three dogs and a dozen cats. Some time ago, one of our cats was severely injured and she claimed someone killed it on purpose, even though she didn't see anything.
 Everytime our pets make a sound at night, she wakes up and says someone is trying to kill them.
 We had a terrible argument today, she accepted to go see a doctor but I don't know what to expect. I'm scared and I don't know what to do. I have my own flat, I want to move there but I don't want to desert my family either.
