My friend said she wants to commit suicide. She said  b.c the man in her head is back....she has a woman there too, but the man just recently came back. He'd been there a few years. He hurt her! Scared her! Not he says hes going to kill all of her family if she doesnt kill herself! He's doing it b.c she killed him before by taking her meds. Now he knows she wont take them b.c there is a woman in her head that protects her....and she cant kill one without the other. She has been in Psychiatric Hospitals for 4 years and she just got out this August.But its her 1st Christmas home in 4 years so she isnt willing to take any meds or go anywhere b.c she knows her family loves her....she just doesnt want them too....but she wants to make this year special for them by being home. Right now she is on a very bad line....and trying to make it through....how can she tell her therapist without her sending her away? And without making the people in her head go away? She feels like they are the only ones who love her! She does NOT want any meds....and does NOT want her family to know anything either!
