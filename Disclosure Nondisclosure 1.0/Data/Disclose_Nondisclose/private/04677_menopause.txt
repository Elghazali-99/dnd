I'm not sure if I'm putting this in the right forum. I'm 61, post-menopausal, never had children and am not sexually active. Internal exams hurt like hell. Even the so-called 'painless' pap smear hurts. My urine samples had traces of microscopic blood. Also I recently saw extremely tiny specks of blood on toilet paper after wiping. Therefore I had a transvaginal ultrasound and it hurt when the probe was inserted. Ultrasound showed small cyst on ovary, fluid in womb and some irregularities in the womb, though the lining isn't too thick. I'm to see a gynecologist and it seems I'm to have a uterine biopsy and a hysteroscopy. Help!! In my area hysteroscopies are usually given without anaesthetic. I've heard women who have had children say it even hurts with a local anaesthetic. I don't want a general either (though don't know if that's an option) as I'm scared of being put under, especially having had bad reactions in past to GA. I'm tempted to refuse the tests as I really don't know if I can tolerate them, but I need to find out about (and hopefully rule out) cancer. I'm so worried. How have others in similar situations coped?
