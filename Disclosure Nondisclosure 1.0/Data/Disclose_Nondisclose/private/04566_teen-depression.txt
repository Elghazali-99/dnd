In the past, I had struggled with bulimia, (it waas a result of my depression), I am recovered, never feel the mental urge to do it anymore, but my body still feels the physical urges. It's not like I think about it like I did before, I ma totally healthy and happy with myself, I am a serious distance runner, everything is amzing and I am back to my old self. But there are days every once in a while when the urge will be overwhelming. My question is, will a doctor prescribe me adderall for this? I have been researching post recovery a lot, and it has come up. I have never had a history of drug use or anything like that, have always been very responsible, active, and health-concious. After reading some of those articles, I decided to try it ( i know bad! but I really have little trust for doctors and medication after my experience with depression, and did not want something new forced off on me. ) My life changed. Just taking 10 mg (I don't get "high" from it), every other day or less, I have not purged or had the urge to purge in months. I feel healthier and happier than I have in years. I never knew how much the bulimia was hurting me, until now that I haven't had it. I am afraid to ask my doctor, I don't think she will believe me, I dont' know, because so many people abuse it. I am able to eat as much as I want whenever, and never feel like bingeing or purging. I am so happy! I would feel so much better if I was under supervision and a prescription though, do you think it's a reasonable thing to ask a doctor? This bulimia is the last thing that I am having trouble getting rid of, and I can't tell you how amazing it would be without those every once in a while urges.!!!!!!
