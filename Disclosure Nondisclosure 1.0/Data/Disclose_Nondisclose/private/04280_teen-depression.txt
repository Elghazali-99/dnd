Alright, so to avoid pity, roughly two years ago, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, like a lot of teens my age. (14 at the time, 16 now.) Over the two years that has passed, my depression gradually went away, and my anxiety stayed. However, with this change brought a new side of me I never thought I would ever become.
 I lost my bestest friend Feburary(2016) to suicide. That had really affected me, especially when kids made fun of his death the next days after. That's when I really started noticing these "switches".
 I have these rapid mood changes, where I change attitudes instantaneously. It's very uncontrolable, and I can switch from agressive to hyper, hyper to depressed, depressed to relaxed, and then a sense of absense. It is not in that order, just examples of what's going on. Along with the agression came this really weird twitch that I get for up to five minutes at a time, where I just... lose control. I fade out of any feeling that I may be going through, and I just seem to become nonexistant at the time. When I snap out of it, I get a really intense feeling of anger and this purely evil mindset; wanting to do the most vile of this to another person, or do something in an act of violence. I don't have any reasoning for the anger, either, as it all just congregates out of nowhere.
 If anyone can kind of understand, it would be great to see if this is something that's just off with me, or if it's something I should actually be concerned about.
