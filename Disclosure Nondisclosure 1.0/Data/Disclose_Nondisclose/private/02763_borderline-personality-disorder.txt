Hello,
I am concerned about my mother's mental condition. She is almost 80, lives alone and does not socialize at all. Her personality seems to change almost hourly (I'm really not exaggerating) and she has accused me, her adult son, of stealing things from her when she can't find them. An example: Her garage is cluttered with 50 + years of junk. She could not find some Christmas decorations that she had stored a year prior and confronted me and accused me of stealing her missing items and selling them on Ebay (we're talking about some decorative plastic cups).
Whenever anything is missing, I'm always accused of taking her stuff. My mother is a very non-social person and constantly repeats stories of family members (her brother, sisters, nieces, nephews, etc.) in a very negative manner. She will telephone her sister and be as nice as can be only to talk about her behind her back in a very mean and nasty way. I'm worried that she is paranoid and possibly delusional. Is there any help that I can get her? I've become used to her nastiness towards me, but to be honest, I've had enough of her calling me a thief when she can't remember where she placed something.
Thank you.
