I just got married 3 months ago.  My husband has always have an anger management problem.  He is both physically and verbally abusive.  The problem is I don't see him as a bad person, because deep inside his heart, he is actually very loving and caring.  But he loose control of his temper once every week.  And sometimes it can get very ugly.  He would slap me and kick me out of the house in the middle of the night.  Whenever he loose control, he is a completely different person and I can see that he has no control over his actions and tempers.  I really love my husband and my family means a lot to me.  I really meant it when I said I will be with him for better or for worse and in sickness and in health.  The reason why I married him is because I believe he has a good heart.  I believe he is abusive because he is sick.  Some ppl tell me that I should just leave him because he is not a good husband, but if he is sick, shouldn't I stick with him and help him out of this ordeal?  But I really don't know how to help him, I have tried many different ways but it is not working.  Slowly and slowly, I am becoming more and more withdrawn and depressed....  I feel loss and I am scared... I feel as if I am walking on an eggshall and my world would crack anytime....  I really need some help and suggestion because I think I am lossing myself....
