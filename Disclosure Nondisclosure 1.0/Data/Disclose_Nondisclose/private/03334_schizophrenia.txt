Can anyone please help??  My boyfriend had a physcotic episode 2 years ago when we were on holiday.  It was frightening for both of us - we spent the last 3 days of the holiday holed up in the hotel room as he said voices were saying they were going to beat him up.  He then had a 2nd one in May - again he heard critical voices.  He's seen a phyciatrist - he has refused medication but is waiting for CBT.  Last week after a minor disagreement he has ended the relationship (its long distance) he said that he is in Devon with a friend (but I know he;s at home on his own) he said that I am to blame for ruining his life and lots of other hurtful things.  Since Tuesday he has refused to take my calls or reply to my texts.  I am worried sick about him.  He is normally loving, considerate and kind - he would never hurt me - so this is completely out of character.  Also in the last 3 years we have spoke every single day - so for him to cut me off is so unlike him.  He also seemed to enjoy hearing me upset last week - something he would never do.  Any advice is much appreciated.  Thank you
