Hello,
I am 44 years old with unexplained fatigue, insomnia, joint and muscle pain, leaky gut, chronic diarrhea, some tingling and numbness in the extremities.  
I have been dealing with this on and off for about 2 years now.  The Diarrhea started 3 years ago after a camplobacter infection.   Since then a whole host of issues have come my way.  
I just recently did an Igenex lyme tests that was pretty much inconclusive.  My recent test results showed I have High level of EBV above 300, deficient in many vitamins and nutrients including B12.  I am currently doing IV vitamin treatments and getting weakly B12 shots.  I am also on an anti Viral and whole hosts of vitamins probiotics and under the care of a physician...  
After all this, I am still getting no relief.  I might even think I'm getting worse.   My lyme test is not conclusive so I have not started any treatment yet.  Very afraid of long term antibiotics that can further harm my gut which as is, is not absorbing any nutrients.  I eat pretty healthy.  Stick to a organic, gluten free, juicing everyday lifestyle.  
I am at a loss and don't know what to do and which way to turn.  I've been progressively getting worse since May of this year.  Any and every advice would be greatly appreciated..
