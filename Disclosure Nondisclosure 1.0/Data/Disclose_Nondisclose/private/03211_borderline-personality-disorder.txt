Ok so here it goes im a 22year old female and I have previously been diagnosed with bpd when I was about 18 after I had to visit my cycatrist after a suicide attempt. I have also in the past done alot of self harm and overdoses. I have a very hard time right now dealing with things again but the only reason I seem to stay strong is for my two babies. I feel so insecure about my self and wanna die so bad. I hate myself and feel like a waste of time. I feel like my boyfriend only stays with me for the sake of our 19month old daughter. He doesn't really associate with me or our 5month old son. I love my son so much and have a great bond but somewhat feel he is left out by people. There is so much more but it's a bit hard to say. I have grew up around my depressed mum and alcoholic dad and seem to of took both there traits ( crying in corner for hours and in past have alcohol dependency ) I tend not to drink now as I get out of control. I have been jail to many times. I'm really having a hard time. I feel like my boyfriend is doing everything behind my back left right and center. I wanna go c my cycatrist but I missed my appointment quite some time back and would have to go back on the waiting list which takes ages. And I don't want social services to get involved if they say I'm mentally unstable. Any help or advice much appreciated.
