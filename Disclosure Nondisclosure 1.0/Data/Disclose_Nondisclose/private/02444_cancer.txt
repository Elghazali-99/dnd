Hello all :) I'm 32 years old and in pretty good health. I found a lump in my left Palm about 2 months ago. It's bigger than the size of a pea, but smaller than a dime. It's somewhat hard, but feels like a bubble/ ballon when I push on it. It's not painful to the touch, but I do have pain in my hand, wrist and extending down my arm. It hurts to use my left hand, wrist and arm. I went to the family doctor and they just dismissed it. It has gotten bigger and the pain has gone from a 2 to a 4-6 (it's a 4 when I don't use my left side, but a 6 when I do). I went to the hand doctor yesterday and he said he had never seen a lump in this spot. He said that its not on a tendon, but next to it in the muscle. He wants to get a better look and ordered an MRI. I'm waiting on them to process my paperwork and call me to schedule the Procedure. The lump is in line with my ring finger and is about mid Palm. About an inch below my ring finger and two inches above my wrist. It is not on a tendon, but is next to it. I'm doing my best not to freak out, but when a doctor says he's never seen anything like that... I can't help but feel nervous and freaked out. I'm trying not to think the worst. Anyone have any information or ideas as to what this could be? Thanks in advance :) I have a photo, had to do it sideways so you can see the lump. I also need to add that I recently had tattoo removal on my ring finger. The hand doctor doesn't think that is relevant though. 
I will have peace of mind after my results. *sigh*
