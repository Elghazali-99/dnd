So, we live close to my parents and my husband has come to resent that. They have come to visit during the summer frequently when they went out on walks. I get very nervous now when I think they may come and hurry and get the kids and find a reason to go somewhere (to the park, to town, anything). I love him very much but I am really out of patience with this issue. He is pushing moving to another state, however, I don't feel comfortable with that as he has become a job jumper. He has had 4 jobs over the past 5 years. No matter what I do it is never good enough, I feel. I have considered counselling, but with his schedule he would never be able to keep an appt. He doesn't care for my sister's boyfriend, so I am made to feel like I am not allowed to see her either and he has a weird grudge against my 6 year old niece. He acts like my 6 year old son isn't even allowed to talk to her. If any of there names are mentioned around my husband it makes me very uncomfortable like there is a fight about to start.  Any suggestions????
