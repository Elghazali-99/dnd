My mother hasn't been in my life long. She walked out on me shortly after she gave birth to me, I went to louisiana to meet her and she seemed lovely but I've realized that it was a cover up. The moment I told her I was pregnant by my long term boyfriend she verbally slandered me calling me a "hoe" saying I was no good but for laying on my back&  opening my legs, she told me to kill my child, has told her friends that its probablly my step fathers baby. Knowing well enough that my stepfather would NEVER touch me in anyway like how she is making it seem! My step father has been more of a parent then she ever has. But its just I wanted her to be in my life and her grandchilds but all she can do is fine ways to ruin me and to call me out my name. When I really don't deserve any of it. Ive ignored her because stress is not good for my baby but I just don't know if I should talk to her or leave it how it is. My grandma says that she's my mother but to me a mother would never degrade her child because she has gotten pregnant. What should I do?
