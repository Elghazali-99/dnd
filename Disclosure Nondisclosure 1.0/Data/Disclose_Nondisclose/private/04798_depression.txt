hi,
I'm 27, and I'm from chile, so I'm sorry if I don´t write correctly :P
I have always had difficulties to sleep, therefore troubles to wake up. In 2003 I was very depressed, I had "an existencial crisis", I cried every night and couldn't sleep until dawn, this was for several months. A way to help me calm myself and get me to sleep was watching tv shows, movies. etc. But now that long ago i overcame that crisis, i still feel the need to just have the tv on when i go to bed, even though if fall asleep inmediately. I can´t just go to bed and sleep like normal people, even if I'm very tired or I didný sleep the night before. My feeling is that I´m like afraid. I have thought a lot about it and I think I´m afraid of feeling that anguish again.
I also get too anxious when I have to get up early in the morning, and I end up sleeping like an hour or nothing at all, beacuse I'm afraid I´ll oversleep (which has happenned to me many many times).
I never took therapy back in 2003, I overcame it by myself; it was very very hard for me and I know I won´t have the same crisis again (or at least by the same reason).
And above all this, I sleep very uncomfortable the most of the time.
 Is there a solution for me?
 Thank you!
