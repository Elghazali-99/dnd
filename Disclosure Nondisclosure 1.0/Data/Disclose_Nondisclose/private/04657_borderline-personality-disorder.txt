My partner was an alcoholic when i met him,, (unknown to me at time)
He was drinking a bottle of vodka a day plus pints beer, I eventually found out and for the last 3yrs it has been pure hell. I have been blaming his moods and actions to drink related,, but he is also waiting to attend a psycho concerning my issues he might have Borderline Personality Disorder,, He has seen doctor who was brilliant and sat and listened to both our complaints.
As all BPD's their partner is either all lovely all or ****!!!!!!  One minute they love them, the next they hate them. But
I cannot take anymore of the verbal abuse,, When he has been drinking I can guarantee I am going to be called every name going, also when drunk he  shouts out all night in his sleep and it is damn scary,  if I try to wake him and tell him to be quiet I could be lashed out at or hurled verbal abuse ,
According to him he cannot remember all this and has made so many apologies and promises, only to broken. What causes the shouting in his sleep,, is it the BPD???  I just know I am ready to leave him,,,,,,
