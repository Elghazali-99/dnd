I'm a 16 year old girl from an affluent family, and I feel as though help for my depression and anxiety is unattainable. I've been severely depressed and had some form of anxiety for the past three years, with multiple suicide attempts and constant self harm urges I act upon rather frequently. I also had an issue with bulimia that lasted about a year and a half, but I'm slowly working myself out of. 
I've never been formally diagnosed, and I've kept my condition a secret from all authority figures including therapists, my parents, and school administrators- I find their ability to exert control over me to be incredibly frightening and I believe that if I allow them the insight into my situation that seeking help requires, something degrading and horrible will happen (along the lines of being denied help/medication, being public ratted out, becoming coddled/severely pitied by people who know, losing the ability to have as many responsibilities I currently have, etc.) 
In California, I can't seek psychoactive medication until I turn 18 without my parents knowing, and that scares me. Does anyone share similar experiences or has any information on anonymous therapy options? Please help!!!!!
