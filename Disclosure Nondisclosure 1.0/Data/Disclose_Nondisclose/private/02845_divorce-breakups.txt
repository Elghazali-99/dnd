I love my husband. Deeply. We have fun together. We like the same movies- minus his obsession with sci fi, we love being home bodies. We love cooking together and going out to dinner. Traveling.  We laugh a lot. We're affectionate with each other. Good level of intimacy. We have similar values and morals.  I genuinely like him as a person, consider him my best friend and my biggest emotional supporter. We often hear from other people that "I want what you two have."
 Here's the problem. He's just not motivated. He's a combat veteran who's battled mental health problems and memory loss for the past 7 years that we've been together. Part of why I love him is because he's caring and sensitive, two qualities that fuel his chronic mental health issues. He's extremely dependent on me financially and emotionally. It often becomes difficult for him to do basic things like pay bills, remember appointments, etc. He's been in school, but hasn't worked in a long time. We don't have many disagreements on how to spend money, but I'm the primary earner. I'm really broken about what to do about our relationship and I'm burnt out from taking care of him. We've been to couples therapy in the past and his behavior has improved a lot (i.e. working on keeping a calendar, taking on more responsibilities at home), but I'm still pretty frazzled.
 I feel like my staying in the relationship is enabling him, but I know he's trying to change. I think it would be a relief to not have to be the breadwinner or to be responsible for him anymore since I'm so mentally exhausted. We've been together 12 years and I'm not sure what to do about this relationship. Advice?
