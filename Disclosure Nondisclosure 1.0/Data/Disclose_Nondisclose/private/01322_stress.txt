I'm a mother of a 3 year old girl currently still with my baby's father. I don't think I'm in love with him. We have been in and off for about 5 years now. We brake up for issues with money usually due to his irresponsibility's. he just can't seem to hold his own... I been helping him with everything all this time.. I have him my car to use which I own (no payments) and I financed a new one. Because his car was repossessed. He has racked up a 800 dollar sunpass bill that is now affecting my credit. I try not to be hard on him because I know he works an gives me money... But what he gives me just dosent cut it. He dosent take into account all the extras we need to pay for such as groceries, gas etc. I ways take it back mainly because he's really good with our daughter. But I find myself playing the mommy of two role. I don't know what else to do. May I add that he has 3 other kids , dosent pay child support and his license is suspended.  I'm so confused. I know I'm not an angel I have my flaws but I think that I'm taking my flaws and running with them... I'm putting my own self esteem down by believing that no-one else will put up with me ( because that's what my family has always told me since I was a little girl).... I barely talk to my father we have a Terrible relationship. Really! I just want to be happy and I want my daughter to be happy and have a happy mother. But u font know where to begin to pick up the Peaces. Last but not least... I'm extremely overweight and It also plays a big part in my decision making mainly because I'm not happy with myself. I feel like I try to settle for less and it all blows up in my face because I want so much more for myself and my daughter. If anyone has been through a similar situation or has any guidance to lend it would be so appreciated.
