Hi, I don't know any other way to ask this question but to come right out with it. Do you think that an 8 year old or 9 year old can inciate sex on her own. Meaning if something happened to you when you was a child and you can not remember, and there is proof that you were touched, does that mean you was sexual hurt. Or did you intend for this to happen? please help me. My mom has proof that i was rapped i can't remember, & the person that did it said i wanted to. I would never think a child would want that to happen to them. I went to counciling when i was younger i do not remember talking to her but only once asking her to please leave me alone. My mom said the first meeting with the counciler i showed her some things with doll babies. I just don't remember any of this, I guess I told my best friend when I was a child and she told her mother whom, told my mom. And my mom seems to think  I blocked it all out. I am now an adult with kids of my own, and I just want to know but at the same time I don't want to even think about it. I sometimes get these thoughts that if I'm home alone or if I was to take a walk outside like I always look behind me because, I feel like some one might hurt me idk why I'm asking MAYBE I SHOULD JUST LEAVE IT ALONE. Thankyou for your time.
