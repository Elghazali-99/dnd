Id really like an educated adult to answer this question if possible, someone who knows a little about depression and situations that could be a sign of it, because i am concerned about it and would like a decent answer. 
 I'm 15 years old, I get worried and upset over small things because in my head they seem like 10x worse, or i end up thinking that the most negative thing is going to happen. 
 for example, i was  talking to my bf on facebook chat and it wasnt working correctly,it wouldnt send my responses, he kept asking if i was there, he was getting mad, he thought i was ignoring him, n i started crying my eyes out, getting all upset and worried because i thought he would breakup with me. 
 I dont know how to explain this but, part of me knows he isnt mad, & then this other part is constantly negative and upset, and basically forces me to think the worst thing is going to happen. I also randomly think he gets mad at me over little random things, and i ask him if he's okay alot, even though  i know hes not mad because he tells me he isnt mad. I dont know why i just always have to be assured he isnt mad or that hes okay, and if not then i get upset and cry smetimes. 
I also cry when hes mad for other reasons, like if hes mad at his dad , he will be straight faced, not talk, seem mad, and then i start crying? i dont know whats wrong with me, i need to know. i worry and stress and cry way too much, and im afraid that this will ruin my relationship, and my life. it interfears way too much, my friends even notice im upset alot for no apparent reason.
