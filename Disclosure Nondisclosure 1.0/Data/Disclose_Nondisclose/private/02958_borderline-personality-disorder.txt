I have not been formally diagnosed with BPD, but i am diagnosed as Bipolar and i have had several therapists suggest i do more research into BPD, and i see many parallels. I'm still learning about it.
 I'm not really sure where to begin with this. I'm afraid to talk to the people i love about my anxiety, fears, depression, etc. because i don't want to push them away, but for some reason i'm always feeling the need to and i can't do it out of fear of how they'll view me. My relationships with people have almost always been very confusing. I used to wear my heart on my sleeve and be very open and honest with everyone i became friends with, but after being repeatedly rejected, i've learned it's best to shut down. Now i'm finding it's very hard for me to open up complelety to people, even those who i trust. 
 I feel like i'm always trying either too hard or not enough with everyone. I tend to always think there is a problem with something or that i'm not doing something right... even when that isn't true at all and i know it. I over-analyze everything and distort things to be what they aren't... and then i think about it so much that i start to believe it. It's hard for me to know what truth is anymore after brain-******* every little thing to pieces. It's exhausting and i feel like i'm always riding a rollercoaster with my emotions because of it. Apparently i do a very good job of hiding my emotions because i've told a few people about this and they always seem shocked because they thought i was fine.
 I'm tired of second-guessing everything i do/say/think. I'm scared to death of approaching my girlfriend with these feelings because i don't want to push her away and i love her very much. I have serious abandonment issues that i feel like are affecting my ability to fully enjoy life. On top of this i have bipolar issues that i have to deal with when they pop up and i am a drug addict in recovery.
