I'm fourteen and I don't go anywhere and stay in my house 24/7. 
I don't have any friends because sadly all of them that I thought were my friends just aren't good people and I don't belong to any clubs, extracurricular activities, etc so I can't make any new friends. 
My parents aren't rich, they're divorced and always busy so it's not like I can really go anywhere or get involved in things I would like to do since that would cost money/time, etc. Where I live there is no places to walk to, no parks close by, and there are tons of busy streets. We have a main library that I would like to go to but it's not really in good walking distance, like I said. Plus I have to maintain the house and watch my little brothers. My mom has just gotten a sitter but on the days the sitter isn't here I am needed. 
I feel extremely tied down and have never been so inactive out of my entire life period. I am depressed (I've been diagnosed), I have anxiety, and my life is crap as of now. I don't see it changing any time. 
What can I do?
