Hi, I'm Mike. I'm fifteen, and I'm going to be honest- I'm overweight and have acne.
 For the past few weeks, I've been having mood swings a lot. I'd be on top of the world one moment, and in the space of a few seconds become depressed. I talk to a a few people online, and sometimes suddenly have to leave with no explanation because I don't feel like talking- of course, this also happens at school, but looking depressed would just send more negative comments my way than normal, so I try to look happy and it works most of the time.
 I was just wondering if it was worth talking to anybody about or if this is just a natural thing to happen while going through puberty. I don't want to look as if I'm worrying about yet another thing if it's not worth worrying about, as I'm already an anxious person and get worried about a lot of things.
 I have not been to see a doctor or talked to anyone yet as I thought I'd get some advice from here first.
 Thank you in advance for your time. If you need any more information, please ask.
