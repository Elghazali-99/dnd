I'm usually a really quiet and calm person, but this guy really brings out the Hulk in me. We work in the same office at the same product, each doing different parts of the product. He knows nothing about what I do, and I know nothing about what he does. I trust his skills in the area he's working on and I expect him to do the same.
 The thing it, he doesn't. He's constantly coming up to me suggesting changes to the product based on what the competition is doing. No arguments, not research, no nothing. When I try to explain that we should stick to the way I made it and give actual arguments, or basically when he hears anything else besides what he wants to hear, he just goes "OK, forget I said anything" and turns his back and leaves. While I'm talking ...
 Or he uses these ****** sarcastically crafted black-or-white phrases like: "OK then, let's not change anything ... ever! Let's leave it like this, because it's so perfect".
 This is when my ire gets up and I get infuriated. I don't shout. I try to remain calm and ask for a counter-argument, but he usually goes "No no .. forget it, we'll do it your way!". If he sees that I'm getting angry, he says: "I can't talk to you when you're aggressive like this, we'll talk when you calm down!"
 This is the **** he pulls when he doesn't have anything to say in his defense. What is this called? Is this some sort of passive aggression on his part? Narcissism? How can I deal with this calmly?
