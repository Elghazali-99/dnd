Hi All,
I only came to really learn about pbd recently and only happened upon it when looking up add/adhd because we thought my nephew had it.  Firstly, I identified with so much of the symptoms of add that I went onto links etc and discovered bpd and then I thought....yes..this is it I have this......as well as add!!  As I have said on previous post that I have always had problems etc this was the first time that I truly thought .........well this is what is wrong with me! Anyway, excited, I made an appt with the my GP so that he could make a referral for me to a psychiatrst(have seen many of them in early years, dont know if bpd was identified then!) but anyway went to GP told him the story and you know what he said......I THINK WE SHOULD CHECK YOUR HORMONE LEVELS AND YOUR THYROID' Now, in fairness to him he does not see me often as I never(thankfully) have physical ailments but I think because of my age he just did not hear me. I am not someone that slopes into the doc looking like the mother of sorrows...maybe I should......I always dress well etc and quite honestly I have being 'normal' down to such perfection that I think I should have been an actress, frankly, I think doc thought I was being hormonal and pretended to be sympathetic. I wanted to stand up and say.........will you listen the hell to what I am saying........but no........I just said.........ok. Anyway, my point is that i think if I was younger he would have listened and taken on board what i said but now I think he just put it down to hormones.  He did say, however that if hormone levels were ok that we would discuss things further. How in the name of God are my hormone levels going to be ok at my age.!!!!!! So doubt there will be that disussion. It is so frustrating.  Anyone else with the same problem would love to hear from you.
Bless All and thanks for listening
