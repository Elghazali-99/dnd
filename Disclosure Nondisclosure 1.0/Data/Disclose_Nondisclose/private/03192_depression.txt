Hi everyone, I am wondering if there is anyone else out there who has had issues of withdrawal from cymbalta. 
 After trying many medications over the course of 10 years (for major depressive disorder) my psych and I settled on a combo of Wellbutrin and cymbalta. I have been on it for years and was instructed recently by a neurologist to go off it. I went to him searching for answers regarding neurological symptoms I've been having and his first response was to start going off cymbalta (not sure why exactly, but I had no other answers...). Apparently this was supposed to make things better?! I'm two months into the process of slowly weaning off the high dosage I was on and I am not only still experiencing all of the same neuro issues as before, but also what I assume are insane withdrawal symptoms! 
 Anyone else had any of these after discontinuing cymbalta? I'd like to know if it really is withdrawal or just my neuro symptoms from before intensifying. Ive been experiencing:
- nausea which I'd never had before (and no I'm not pregnant, thought of this already...) causing me to want to eat little and only something very bland like plain rice.
- overwhming pulsing/ whoosh feeling in head (like my heartbeat is in my brain and ears) which intensifies the nausea for about three seconds. This comes on whenever I shift my eyes to look in another direction. 
- perhaps because of the nausea, but sensitivity to smells... I'm sensing smells that no one else does and they are increasing my nausea.
- strong electrical tingling feelings in my brain and head 
- jolts thoughout my body that cause jerky spasms. Like I'll feel a jolt someplace that will cause my reflexes to activate in response... Makes it very hard to try and fall asleep or relax...
- cannot sleep normally! perhaps intensified by the above, but holy cow I should not be awake until the birds come out! 3 straight weeks of this now an the sleep deprivation can only be making me feel worse!
- so foggy in my brain and thoughts that I forget the word I read one before, forget my train of thought only when beginning a sentence, and cannot finish a thought without diverting to another one... Creates a spinning feeling...
- crying from everything. Only a minute or two then I forget what had made me emotional. But then it happens again in a few minutes.
- feeling feverish but my body temp is quite LOW (95-96 degrees)
- oy vey, painful stiff joints and random throbbing muscle pain... I'm groaning like I'm 96, not 26! 
 If you can picture all that then you can imagine what a crazy person I must look like! I've barely made it to work most days and some days I couldn't. Needing solutions desperately! Grateful for ANY insight!
