have you checked gcmaf immune therapy, keep an eye on this
 it was studied in the 90 for cancer but since it is an immune therapy it has been used last on cancer, we are using it for hiv, hbv, cfs infections (viral infections)
 you better keep an eye on it, it will never come out as a drug industry product because it can t be patented
 CFS trials (Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus infection)

 gcmaf biolabs producers in europe and studies
http://www.gcmaf.eu/info/

 do not look for anything in US, there are no labs for tests or biolabs making gcmaf, it is all only in europe, US is too controlled by intrests and heathcare is too bad, routine machines and blood tests are missing even for hbv.the most advanced hospitals are in germany for all three diseases
