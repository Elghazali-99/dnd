Hi, I've been diagnosed with BPD in the past.  I've been through therapy, etc.  and have been hospitalized against my will several times within the last 3 years but the mental health system is a joke where I live.  Also, I do not believe in taking psychotropic medicine.  I would like to say that I'm doing better depression-wise, no stress or anxiety, and don't cut anymore (but the urges are there & i can't be around sharp objects because of the temptation).  Recently, however, after the first of the year, I've been seeing people who arent there...they are further away in my vision then gone in a flash.  This happens a lot to me when I shuttle drive (i work for a local dealership).  This happens daily & often.  I don't hear voices though.  I am very spiritual (New Age) so I'm confused...is this part of my awakening or is this a mental illness?  FYI, I don't drink or do drugs and I get plenty of sleep.  I want to talk to someone about this.  I don't have a regular doctor or therapist so I was going to discuss this with my gynocologist on thursday.  I am afraid to tell her in fear that she will have me involuntarily hospitalized (this has happened several times in the past).  Do I tell her or should I not tell her?  And if I do tell her, what are my chances of being baker acted??  Your advice would be appreciated.  I don't want to see a psychiatrist, been there / done that.  I just don't know.
