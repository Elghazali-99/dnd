my father was terminally ill and i was suffering anxiety attacks.  so my dr put me on 1m of klonopin 2 times a day and it worked wonderfully, about a month later i felt it starting to wear off about half way through the day. we to see dr again he upped the morning dose to 1.5 mg and still 1 mg at night
 well last monday my father passed and anxiety got worse and dr upped to 2 mg twice a day for 1 week just to get through the week after the 2nd dose of 2 mg i noticed , myself getting aggitated, and very angry. called dr and he told me to back off to the 1.5 mg.  sill did not work. got even worse, and depression now saw dr yesterday and he gave me cymbalta to start taking 30 mg for 1 week and 60 mg next 2 and added 0.5 xanax 3 times a day and to continue taking the 1 mg of klonopin twice a day.
 i understand the greif process and everything i am going through have talke to grief couns and they agreed that i needed something to assist the klonopin, but is the addition of cylmbalta and xanax safe.
 i am 47 years old in good health and have had this dr for 2o years and trust him, but i was looking for a second opionin
 thanks for any help.
