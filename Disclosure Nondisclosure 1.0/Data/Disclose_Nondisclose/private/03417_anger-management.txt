im a stay at home mother of three beautifull children ,i live with their dad .Our life on a whole is acturally really lovely ,we do find it a strugle to find things to do with not much money but we pay all our bills so i hav eno money stress i have lovely good friends and a realy nice mum who i get on really well with .I take my children to playgroups parks we go walking and to be fair i belive we eat a healthy diet .
The problem i have is that im so so very irritable and angry all the time ,my partner is on the reciving end of it alot .
Everything makes me irritable ,noise ,mess i never feel percived or listend too .Some times i feel angry and lonely and to be honest like a failier i know im not one i do voulentry work at the local community center i get told by people all the time that im like a breatch of fresh air in there but at home i dont feel like that at all i hate being in my own company and get quet anxious when theres no other adults around.
My children are 4 ,3 and 16 months old .ive had visists from my health visitor because i contacted her because i was bursting in to tears and felt bewildered but it only lasts about 2 weeks then i feel fine again id go as far as saying i feel high as a kite some weeks full of ideas and itching to do the next thing availible i swing from fantasticy sunny to  feeling really odd.
i do analise myself alot so ive made notes and tryed aromatherapy eating healthaly and exercising and walking more .is this how life is suposed to be ??up and down and so irritable and i shout alot at times i feel so guilty afterwards it makes me feel like a bad person my dad was a bully and never had a good word to say about me i dont want to be like him an agressive bully that dosent listen to any one .i stopped drinking too as i thought this would help ,it has a bit i diont get hang overs and i do feel better for not doiing that for about 5 months now .maybe im thinking its just the way i  am stroppy my partner says i have a split personality and it scares him ive never hit anyone but i have run upstairs and screamed into a pillow and pulled my hair out in anger i would never hurt any one theres so much pain in the world without me adding to it dose anyone have any idea what it is that makes me this way or a methord  of controlling myslf . sorry it is long xx
