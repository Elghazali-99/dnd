This is not something that I can just brush under the rug.  My brother-in-law really hurt my feelings a lot over the past year.  He would tell everyone what was going on in his life, but not me.  I always had to hear it from someone else, when he almost died due to a seizure while he was driving.  He never told me that he was going to be driving again.  He didn't even tell me that he had a seizure at work.  
He has been ignoring me pretending that I don't matter.  I used to live with my in-laws back in the day and I am very close to the family.  When my husband and I moved away he got very mad at us and refused to talk to us.  Now that we have moved back he still wants to have nothing to do with us.  
I just want to yell and scream about how he has made me feel, but he won't listen to me.  He lies to everyone these days. I am not stupid and I always figure out when he is lying to me.  Every time I see him, I always find new reasons to be pissed at him.  
I can't talk to him, because he just gets mad at me when I try to talk to him about this type of stuff.  I am stressed to the max about this.  My question is what do I do to begin feeling better about this, and forgive him?
