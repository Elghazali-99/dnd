I have always had problems with insecurities and low self esteem.  My big issue now is with jealousy.  I have let my jealousy spiral out of control to the point where my son and his wife want nothing more to do with me until I commit myself to a psychiatric facility for treatment.  They have a new son who is 10 months old & the serious problems began right after his birth.  I was feeling left out of his life as my daughter-in-law was including her mother in many activities and outings with my new grandson and leaving me out.  Pictures of the 3 of them were constantly posted on Facebook and the jealousy in me grew into something so ugly that I am not allowed around them any longer.  My son says I'm CRAZY for having these emotions & wants me to commit myself.  I've let my emotions cause me to lash out at my son's wife to the point where I said I hated her.  I admit that much of what I say is out of hurt and anger but I don't know how to control myself sometime.  Am I schizo, or just depressed?  I have a lot of family history of depression and have myself been on antidepressants on and off for probably over 20 years; haven't been on any now for about 5 years.  I do need the anxiety medication alprazalom nightly though to help me sleep as I have sleep apnea.  What should I do?  Seek psychiatric help; individual therapy or just voluntarily commit myself?  Please help!
