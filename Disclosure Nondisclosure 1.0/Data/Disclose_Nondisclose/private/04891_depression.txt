I wasn't sure where to put this but anyway. He's 24 and I'm only 19. We're both guys. 
 Because he's years older than me, he somewhat grew up in the 90's. I technically didn't. I do remember the 90's but it's not enough. Because of that, I've envied him ever since. He's even 1 year older than my sister. You could argue he only spent his childhood in the late 90's but it's still better than what I got... But there's a list more on how he's better than me.
 1.
Him: He passed his driving test at 17.
Me: I started my lessons recently but got cancelled a few weeks after.
 2:
Him: He lost his virginity after he turned 18 and still gets a lot of girls attracted to him.
Me: I'm still a virgin at 19.
 3:
Him: He's got a lot of friends who support and praise him.
Me: I only have a few friends because I'm mostly introverted.
 4:
Him: He's got a lot to do which keeps his life fun.
Me: I'm always bored and miserable with not much to do.
 5:
Him: He's got a good paid job.
Me: I'm still in college doing a boring IT course which I regret taking.
 That's about it. I know a lot of you may hate me since these are VERY shallow reasons and I sound whiny, but it's how I feel and I can't just lie about it. It's really affecting me a lot to the point of depression. I always think about how he's so lucky. I even keep dreaming about it which fuels the jealousy even more. 
 What can I do to make myself feel better? And to stop me being stupid and shallow?
