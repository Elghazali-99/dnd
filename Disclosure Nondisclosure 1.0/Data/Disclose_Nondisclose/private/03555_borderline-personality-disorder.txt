Hello
I have been in a relationship with a man for nearly 2 years now. He has been diagnosed with BPD six years ago, has had a lot of therapy and is considered to have a mild form of the illness. Our relationship is complicated by the fact that he lives in belgium and I live in the UK. Throughout our relationship he has had times when he pushes me away is filled with suicidal thoughts and will not listen to reason and is very angry and unpleasant. In the summer of this year I had a mild breakdown and I ended the relationship but we got back together and since then things have been much improved and there has been a lot more hope. We spent 2 weeks together a few weeks ago and we got on really well and were very close and happy and even discussed marriage. Since i got home he has been panicking that he has nothing to offer me and wants to return to therapy. I have been understanding but upset but he has still been very loving towards me. Today he is back to a very bad place, saying he has no connection with anybody and feels his life is empty and he is empty. He has been very angry when i try and talk to him. I dont know what to do. I love him dearly but feel this relationship is now too much for me. I cannot deal with his mood swings and feel really worthless. I would like to ask if anybody has any ideas about what I can do to help him? Do you think I am wasting my time? Can someone with BPD ever fully commit and be able to deal with a relationship? I love him but I cannot take the stress. I feel very taken for granted by him. I want to just walk away but feel guilty about feeling like that. I simply don't know how to handle this situation.
