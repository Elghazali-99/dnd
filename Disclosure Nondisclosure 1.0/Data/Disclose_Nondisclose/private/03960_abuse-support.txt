It has been TEN YEARS...and I still don't feel safe. I have moved cities to physically separate him from me. I can't afford a therapist otherwise I would be with one tomorrow. Why Thanksgiving? Why did he pick a day that I will never be able to forget? I can't close my eyes without seeing his face. I can't turnover without feeling his hands on me. I remember every moment of Thanksgiving 1998. I have flashbacks when I serve Pumpkin Pie...how ridiculous is that?!!! I should be over this!! Why is he still in my head, in my body?!! It's not F$%^ng FAIR!!! I have to admit...part of this is my fault. I have tried talking to a counselor but my parents told me not to reveal everything to spare my step-brother. They didn't believe me anyways...it took him to get married, have two kids, and force his wife to have sex with him for them to acknowledge the abuse he did to me. They (my parents) had the audacity to invite him to Thanksgiving two years ago without my knowledge. And then told me they couldn't choose between him and me. I had to call someone to come pick me up and then I was looked badly upon. No one understands...no one. I have so many questions and no one to ask them. How long do these flashbacks last? How do I replace a trigger that would cause a flashback to cause nothing? I know these are questions that really cant be answered but I just needed to vent.
