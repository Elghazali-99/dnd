My son is ADHD, BPD, Anxiety, Panic, and oppositional. He is not book smart. and his psychiatrist agrees that he does not live in reality. Recently diagnosed with a seizure disorder.  He is currently 19 years old, has had two STDs, gotten someone pregnant and is verbally abusive and has damaged things in the house.  He likes to talk alot of stuff on the internet and recently got shot at in our very nice community. He did well while on Depakote but then had NMS and was taken off and tried on Lithium. While in the hospital he had a grand mal seizure.  That was two years ago.  He is just now going back on some medication (Concerta) due to the fact that his body has become very sensitive to medication.  He does nothing on his own.  He basically won't eat unless someone helps him. His verbal abuse and total disregard for everyone and dangerous liasions are getting too much to handle.  He does not work.  Did not finish school (therapeutic day school). Constantly says "he's dying".  I have another son who is just fine and excells in school and sports.  Is there somewhere he can go even to just give us a break?  He wont see a therapist because he has not liked any of the ones he has had.  What can I do?  I am a single Mom and his Dad will not help.
