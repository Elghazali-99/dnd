Long story short. When i was 14, (2 days b4 my 15th bday), my father molested me. I didnt want to tell anyone because he had said "dont tell anyone. Or else." I had finally told my aunt 2 months later because i had nightmares about it. She had overheard me telling my sister(who is also my best friend). She sat down with me and i explained everything to her. She was disgusted. She said that i had to tell my mom. I didnt want to for fear of her not believing me. So my aunt had told my mom for me. My mom started crying and said she believed me because he has a record for things like that in the past. We went thru all the court stuff and nobody believed me because there was no proof because i had waited so long to tell anyone. I am now 18 and its so hard to get close to any guy for fear that they will to, do the same thing or worse. I just dont know when life will become normal for me. I want to be able to live my life without fearing that he will come back and hurt me, or that any guy i get close with will hurt me. I just cant forget the feeling and how it is to live with something so disgusting! I feel like its my fault and i just want those feeling to go away so i can live my life like a normal teenager. Any suggestions? it would help a lot! thank u!
