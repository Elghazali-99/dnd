This is a serious question so please give me serious answers.
I don't know if I was abused because I grew up with it and it was normal. Nothing sexual was ever done to me but when I was in second grade my dad started to hit me. NOT spank me. He hit me on my head. He'd hit to top of my head with his fist like a hammer. He'd only do it if I had bad grades though so I didn't think it was that bad. As I grew older his reasons for hitting me started to seem more and more minute. Once, I was on the computer and he came up behind me and hit me by surprise. He chased me upstairs and tossed blows at me while yelling at me to wash a cup I left on the table in the kitchen. It wasn't my cup. I missed my bus one morning, and he woke me up by yelling at me, grabed me by my hair, tossed me into the closet and threw shoes at me and kicked me for about ten or fifteen minutes. I then got up and got ready for school. As I left my room he chased me down the stair to the garage and hit me in the back with a broom handle repeatedly while yelling at me because my younger sister was going to be late. As we drove to school he continued to yell at me in the car and hit me. When he dropped me off I was crying. He told me to wipe and tears and go to class. Many more senarios like these have happened. 
I'm seventeen now. I still live at home and my dad lives with us. He hasn't hit me in about two years. Do his past actions still count? Am I overeacting? Was I even abused?
