27 yo male 
 A few months ago I experienced cramping pain in my lower left abdomen (felt like the large intestine). I became constipated and would sometimes feel like needing to defecate without being able. Eventually my bowel movements returned to normal but the cramping feeling would sometimes return. I didn't think much of this.
 About a month ago I started to feeling a burning pain in my stomach and left side after eating. Sometimes there was sharp pain under my left ribs. I also began to feel a dull pain in my middle back. If I lay down the pain would begin to radiate outward causing a tingling feeling throughout much of my body. This was very disconcerting and made it difficult to sleep for a couple of nights. The tingling would stop if I got up. A couple of times I would wake with a numb arm.
 About a week after these symptoms started I started feeling muscle twitches in my legs. It originally felt like there was fluid flowing through my thighs. Two weeks ago this became much more pronounced. The twitching is almost constant. When I walk it will feel like my limbs are wobbly and I sometimes feel I will lose coordination although this never happens. The twitching seems to have spread to my abs and possibly my back.
 I may have lost weight. I'm not sure when it happened but this is my lowest weight in years. I've usually been around 155 lbs and am now in the low 140's. 
 I have been to the doctor and certain tests were done that all came back normal.
 They did a metabolic panel, hepatic function, urine analysis, complete blood count, lipase, thyroid.
 The pain in my abs and radiating to my back has me scared it could be pancreatic cancer. Maybe it's colorectal and the muscle twitching is caused by tumor on my spine? I realize it's unlikely for my age and these are disaster scenarios, but all these symptoms has me freaked out.
