Hi, I have been diagnosed with Bipolar I w/o Physcotic/mixed episodes w/severe depression but I sometimes wonder if I have schizoprenic tendencies.  I have told anyone of my thought; not even my p-doc.  I have heard and seen a few things years earlier, only a few time and it has been 4 yrs. since last time.  I heard voices a few times as a teenager and felt the presence of something standing by me, very strong feeling.  When I was 54 (now 57) I saw a evil figure and a felt a good figure behind me.  My fingers were crossing into a cross and something was physically pulling them apart and then they would go back to a cross, this happened several times.  I heard a voice say, "Go away, Christ lives in this house" and it all went away.
 I tend to isolate,but I have alot of biopolar symptonms like sudden rage. mind having thoughts that will not go away, unable to concentrate, feeling of elation and thinking I am capable of anything, impulsiveness, deep depression also.  I don't have friends and would rather stay by myself.  Could I have schizoprenia tendencies or would this just be part of bipolar?
