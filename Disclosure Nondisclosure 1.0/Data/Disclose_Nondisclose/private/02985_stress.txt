I came home from having a haircut on Thursday at 2 p.m. and after hanging up my keys, I don't remember anything else other than I instantly felt abdominal pains and thought I had to go to the washroom and that I might faint.  I found out that instead, I had a disagreement with my 18 yr. old son, I was angry with my husband, and then after crying in my daughter's room for about 10 minutes, I fell to the floor.  My husband and children put me in bed and I repeatedly asked where I was, what had happened, had I gotten a haircut that day, etc. etc.  My family called 911 and I was taken to the hospital.  I 'woke' up in the hospital at 5:30, unaware how I had gotten there or what had taken place.  I had no memory of anything between the time I felt ill at home and then woke up in the hospital, yet I apparently moved around my house, talking (and arguing) with my son and husband - (I don't usually argue with my son or husband as we get along great) and then I fell down and said I felt faint.  However, I apparently even talked with the EMS staff who came to our house and had them help me walk out of my house to the ambulance although I don't remember ANY of this.  The hospital did blood work, a cat scan and checked my Blood Pressure and everything appeared normal.  Please help me as I am so afraid that I will lose my memory/sense of reality again for no apparent reason.  (I have been worried about my son going back to school as I'll miss him and I also worry about getting older a lot but these have not been debilitating worries.  Also I am an elementary school teacher and I have been off all summer so I am rested).  Please please give me any ideas about what happened and why.  Thanks.
