I can't control my brain, i can't control myself, please help!
i always keep thinking something like now i'm successful man, now i'm driving some expensive ferrari now i'm flying in the air!
it sounds CRAZY! ya i'm becoming crazy! day by day my thinking is nonstop increasing & my head & brain always feels really heavy! something like running thoughts!
Now behind the scenes here is little story!
 i really want to become successful person & for that i always keep learning & working (always means 8 hours a day 7 days a weak & 30 days a month etc) i never go out!, i don't talk with anybody, i don't have any friends i don't even know how to make friends..! i just learn & work learn & work!
i always take heavy tension in my mind for success! everyday i decide what i have to do today what i'll do tomorrow!
& bcoz of that now i'm basically a crazy person (person i'm only 17) i don't give so much concentrate in school! i always learn & work! (if you thinking what i learn & what i work) then i really love everything related to multimedia & that's what i do!!! i always take simple things really seriously for instance i want to take a soap in mall then i'll compare 10-20 soaps & then i will take the best one! that's not joke i'm serious its really difficult to tell how i take my LIFE! anyways without making this story long! lets come to point!
 i know you can't enter in my brain & restart everything or settle but i just wanna know if you were in my situation what will you do! or any other suggestion you can give to cool down brain!
One last thing i want to ask what type of problems can come if a person takes too much Tension, Overthinking & all those words..!
