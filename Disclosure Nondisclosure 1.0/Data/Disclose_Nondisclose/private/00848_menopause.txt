I'm 42 and starting to get worried about this long cycle that seems to be getting a bit heavier instead of lighter. On 7/14 I started my cycle which was nothing unusual but here I am still on it almost 11 days later. Peri menopause? The blood is not heavy or light, sort of what it's usually like mid cycle and it's bright red. Around day 7 it seemed to be letting up a bit but now it seems to be getting a tiny bit heavier every day, not heavy just heavier.  I didn't have a lot of PMS just tender breasts but nothing too crazy that I remember, I know I didn't take anything for cramps or backaches. The only pain I've really had was one day last week around day 4 I had to stop running because I did have some pain which seemed to be in my right ovary region and I needed to walk it off for about 10 minutes and then I was able to run again. It wasn't cramping pain more like a sharper pain. I should mention I only have half a right ovary because it had to be removed when a cyst was removed back in 04. My FSH has been high for over 10 years (well I assume it still is, we adopted our first child and then in early 2009 I thought I was starting menopause but it turns out I had one good egg left and she's 4 years old now. Also this past year I have gained a lot of weight around my middle and I've never had issues with gaining like this before, it usually all goes to my butt & thighs. 
 Do you think this could be the early stages of menopause? A cyst? Something else? I do not want to call doctor if there is nothing she can do but my husband is going to think I'm conspiring against him! I'm on vacation right now so I cannot go see my doctor anytime soon. 
 Thanks gang for any feedback or help you can offer.
