Hello,
 I don't know exactly how to start, but I am 35 years old, 34 weeks pregnant with my second child.
I am not from the US (no family around), my husband is constantly having to work offshore to support a growing family - and I love him to death. Our first child is 4 years old and diagnosed with mild autism.
In other words I am by myself today and trying to show some patience toward my little boy. I suffered with depression (mood swings) and was on Prozac until we decided to have another baby. I stop prozac 2 months before I got pregnant and that was around 10 months and a half ago. I just feel lonely, tired, isolated, overwhelmed.... I want to believe that once my baby is born I will be back on my medication and everything will be good again. I mean, things are not bad! I have a family I dreamed of, I love them, they love me... we don't want for anything, I just seem not to be able to be happy. I just feel there's someone else living in my body. I see all these good things around me and I just can focus on the bad. I just need to talk to somebody, I guess. Thank you. God Bless!
