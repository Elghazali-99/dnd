Hi Everyone, I'm so happy to have found this community! This is the first time that I've had the opportunity to discuss my struggles with people who might actual be able to understand the situation!
 My mom WITHOUT A DOUBT has undiagnosed BPD along with Munchausen syndrome. I'll give you some quick bullet points to explain why I am certain of this:
 BPD symptoms:
- compains constantly that no one loves her, especially after being asked to do something or being critized
-chronically under-employed
-Friendship are very intense and end abruptly because they "did something to her"
-black/white thinking: people and situations are all bad or all good, no in between
-threatens suicide whenever she is angry, which is often, plus a few serious attempts (which she plays off as "accidents" when they aren't successful)
-violent temper tantrums at the drop of a hat, which usually disappear quickly with no explanation
-disregard for the safety of others
-constant financial problems 
 As for the Maunchesen: my mom loves the hospital. She has a surgery or two a year, usually around holidays or birthdays, gets irrate with doctors and seeks other opinions when she is told that nothing is wrong, insists on being transported via ambulance whenever she is mildly injured, over-exagerates the extent of her injuries/sickness and brings up her lenghtly medical history frequently in normal conversation even if it isn't related to the topic at hand...
 Which brings me to my question: how am I supposed to deal with the type of behavior? I'm only 22, and I live in a different state from my family. I very seldom speak to my mom because she is unwilling to admit that she has emotional problems and she quite frankly put me through a lot growing up. Having grown up in this envornment I have my own BP tendencies which I am trying to work through (thankfully, my symptoms are rather mild). People around me tell me that I should "give my mom what she wants", i.e. be a dutiful daughter, offer her some praise and attention without her having  to do something drastic to seek it out. But I must say that I have not forgiven her for the past and what she is continuing to put my family through now. Maybe I could if she were to seek help, but that is defineitely not going to happend since she blames everone for her problems. 
 Sorry for the long post! Here is the basic dilema: she called me on Easter crying, stating that she is in the hospital because "her leg gave out and she is going to have to spend a week in a nursing home for rehab".  I did speak her then as well as talk to the rest of my family. I usually only talk to them once every few months  but she left me a message yesterday stating that she's still in the nursing home, not doing well, wants me to call. I have not called her back. How should I be handling this? I feel as though indulging her just reinforces this attention seeking behavior but at the same time not acknowledging her leads her to do more drastic things. It seems like a no win situation and any contact with her is very difficult for me. Any advice? 
 (on the plus side: my dad finally gave me his blessing for leaving home. He's happy I got away from this and that I'm doing something with my life. I only wish he would do the same instead of being my mom's punching bag. Not to mention my little bro who just turned 20 and still lives at home, no license, no plans for the future. My mom's behavior really made him frightened of the world and I only wish he could get some help too! The whole family needs help which is definitely why I'm becoming a therapist!) 
 Thank you for reading this! It really is helpful to be able to open this up for discussion with a community like this :)
 Blessings to all!
