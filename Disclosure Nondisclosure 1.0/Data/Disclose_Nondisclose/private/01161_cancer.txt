I had lipoma excision on my back (right side) size of a egglast Dec 30, 2013. My question is when I do chest xray this year 2015. I see a scar on my on back  when I do xray, but according to the technician my xray is clear When I do another xray last may to work abroad the center unfit me to work due to my xray show (( fibrosis on my right upper back  & post operative scar)). My initial reaction is I do another opinion I do xray again and look for lung doktor. I tell to him what the center say about my xray aND I told to him that I had excision of lipomalast Dec 2013. then the doktor explain me there's a  scar or fibrosis on my right side size of an egg even the line of excision he said there's nothing to be worry off its onLy fibrosis. So he gave me a recommendation about it. But  center doktor refuse to accept it even I said I had an operation of lipoma. They insist it's fibrosis they juse say jus gI've the xray to them to compare when i gI've d scan xray they want a negative not a scan one. B'coz of that i didnt come back cOz i know what wI'll happendix maybe that work is not fit to me... can somebody kindly help to  explain to me regarding this matter. I didn't imagine removing a fats(lipoma) on my back can cause trouble to me not to work abroad anymore vice versa.
