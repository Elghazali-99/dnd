my doc prescribed me seroquel/quetiapine 25 fto 50mg, but i took 75mg the first night cause i could not see it working at first, then slept for 15 hours and tired 3 more, then later at night i tried put it down to 50 mg and i was nearly at sleep 2 hours later but not in bed, so i drank a cola and some chips and the med didn't work an hour later(about 2,5 hours after i took it), now i took another pill about 2 hours ago and i can't seem to have it working, i'm still tired tho but not tired enough, if i took another 3 pills right now will i be asleep and would it be too much with 150mg during this day, cause of the failed sleep? i don't care if how long i sleep tomorrow, but it's gonna be ackward not knowing what is the best to do tomorrow. is it possible that it just don't work anymore or is the coffeine affecting it together with the snacks? what did i do wrong, cause last night it worked with 2 pills within 30 min and a 3rd just before bed time, but now it's not wokring anymore?
