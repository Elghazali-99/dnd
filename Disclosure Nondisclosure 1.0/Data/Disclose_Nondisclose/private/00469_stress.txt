Hello. i am a college student and under tremendous stress and have been for the past month. since then, i have had this weird feeling that i am not real and that i am not controlling my actions, but yet i know i am. i know i am real and i realize i feel strange. i can go through a day normally, but when i am by myself sometimes and alot of times at night i dont feel like i am real. i have felt this feeling before in my life, but just for like one day at a time. i am away at school and dont feel real when i am here. but when i go home and i am in my comfortable home environment i feel normal. let me give you some background. i am a sophomore in college and something really bad happened to my friends and i the summer after high school. we were on the way to the beach in a carravan of three cars. i was in the last car with my boyfriend. the first car made it through a weird stop sign and the second car then tried to go but was hit by a 18-wheeler. in front of my eyes, his car spun three times and was on fire. i remember this like it was yesterday and i never actually got over it and dealt with it. i never let myself think about it because i was toobusy, my first year at college and the thoughts just made me sad. i am scared that never letting myself recover from this is why i feel so weird and i dont know if i need to get help. i am also very stressed now so that could also be a reason for why i feel the way i do. can anyone help me?
