Hi.  I wonder if anyone has had a similar experience....  Long story short, I had a radical hysterectomy (actually, everything out except the cervix) 10 months ago.  After being on synthetic estrogen (Enjuvia) for many months and not feeling well at all, I finally found myself a better doctor who listened to my symptoms and put me on the Vivelle Dot patch (bioidentical estradiol), .075  I've been on that for about 3 weeks now, maybe 4.  Anyway, just 4 days ago, I also started on bioidentical progesterone, 50 mg, in the form of a capsule that I take orally.  My question is this:  can this progesterone cause one's appetite to increase dramatically??  Ever since Wed., my appetite (which had been severely depressed) has been unstoppable -- I want to eat everything in sight!  Really bad with the carbs and sugars though.  Honestly, I think I've gained 5 pounds in the past 4 days; my stomach is swollen, I feel bloated.  In all other areas, I feel great -- greater than I've felt in the past 10 momths!  However, my  jeans aren't fitting me anymore now and I feel HUGE, like I've gained twice the amt. of weight that I really have.  Is this the progesterone?  Could it mean that I'm taking too much (even though it's only 50 mg)?  If anyone has experience with this and can shed some light on what's going on, I'd sure appreciate it.  I'm supposed to be going up to the Dells to an indoor waterpark with my husband and 2 young kids this coming week, and the thought of putting on a bathing suit (or even being able to fit INTO a bathing suit) is really appalling to me right now.  Ugh!  Please help or advise.  Thanks!   K.
