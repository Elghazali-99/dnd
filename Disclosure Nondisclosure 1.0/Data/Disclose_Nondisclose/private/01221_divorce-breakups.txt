Hi there,
I've been married for 14 years and have 2 girls. My husband has not been able to hold a job for more than 2-3 months. Even though he has a bachelor's degree in engineering and a post graduate diploma in computer science, he says those aren't enough to get a good job, so he always studies for more courses. We live on child benefits and social security insurance. I can't work because my kids are small. What I need to know is, is it a pathological/psychological problem that he ALWAYS wants to go to college. Whatever he studies for isn't enough (in his own words). I've been waiting and waiting in the hope of a good job, but now I don't know what to do. He says the courses that he's taken in the past 14 years (software courses) are now redundant as the software industry is ever evolving. I'm fed up of this 'student for life' husband, but don't know how to stop him from studying. He's very manipulative in convincing me about the benefits of the courses/programs he studies for. Has anyone else been in my position?
