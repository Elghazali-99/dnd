my periods started on 26-02-2015 
first day the flow was not so heavy. but it was so painful. 
same on second day mean on 27-02-2015. still flow is not so heavy as my previous normal periods. 
 one more thing. i was having flow which is not so heavy but also not so light. its just u can say normal, i can feel blood flowing. 
and its flowing with the gap of 2 to 3 hours, not continuously. 
 now on 28-02-2015. i have no flow since morning. i did pregnancy test with strip at home at it shows "no pregnancy". 
 me and my boyfriend did dry humping on the 11-02-2015 with full clothes on. and he got ejaculated in his pents. we never toucehd each others private with bare hands. but we were afraid that the semen on his pent can travel through mine and make me pregnant so i took contraceptive pills that day. 
 now i want to know, am i pregnant or is there any chance? and few other questions are. 
1- why my periods are like this is it because the contraceptive pill which i have taken before? 
2- is it possible to have periods during your pregnancy? 
3- is there any chance that i could be pregnant in this case? or no chance? 
4- what i have told you about my periods, is it a normal one? 
5- is it possible that sperm could travel through his pent to mine and make me pregnant?
 do i have to worry now? 
please reply me soon i am worried.
