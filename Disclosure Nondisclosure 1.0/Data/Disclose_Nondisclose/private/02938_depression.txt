Help me please work out what is wrong with me. 
 Where to start with my mental state. Recently I have had trouble sleeping, the thought of sleep and the next day makes me feel physically sick, I just lay in my bed with the lights off for hours. when I do actual get to sleep I have really vivid dreams that wake me up or it feels like I close my eyes and my alarm goes off. I woke up at 2am the other morning and wanted o go for a walk, like a really long walk, I don't know where to but I wanted to walk somewhere. 
I don't like my friends, I don't have a best friend, I hang out with a big group at school and they all have their best friend but I don't- I stand with them but I don't want o be there. I feel like I have no one to talk to, I get nervous talking to people, I get nervous around people full stop. 
I get wrapped up in my imagination sometimes, like I daydream but if I get interrupted I freak out, I can't concentrate until I get back into my head and finish what I was thinking about. It sometimes messes with reality, like I know that my day dreams are my imagination but once I come back into the real world I kinda forget and think that something's have happened. I also sometimes blank out, I'll be sitting watching TV I'll get up for no reason and I kinda feel like I am floating but not actual moving and then when I come to ill be in a different room.
I haven't told anyone about how I feel, which isn't making it any better but I have tried to bring it up to my friends and they just told me I was being a drama queen. Maybe I am but right now it feeling like everyday is a struggle, like its a battle just to get through the day. 
 Please someone help me. I am desperate. 
 Thank you
