This isn't so much a question as it is a statement.  I've suffered from depression as far back as I can remember of my 48 years.  I was mentally and physically abused by my father and it is only now that I am discovering the depths of this abuse.  Recently, a lot of my abuse was validated by my sister who for years remained silent on the subject.  According to her, "she didn't want to acknowledge it" but she was witness to most of the abuse I suffered.  Getting that justification was what I needed in order to open more doors and to help get the healing process started at even a deeper level.
 I began therapy about 5 years ago when I literally was coming unglued.  My life was in a tailspin and every decision I was making was another step out of the light and into the darkness.  I hit rock bottom and had an epiphany.  I finally knew I had to do something or it would eventually be too late.
 I am writing this because of another young kid just embarking on life who decided life and what it held for him was something he didn't want to encounter.  (We're in a small community and suicide is all too prevalent here.)  I didn't know this young man and I have no idea the battles he fought and all of life's turns that led him to this decision, but I know where I was and I too thought it was the end of the line.
 In closing, I want to say that there is help out there and there is hope.  You have to want the help in order to receive it and you have to be completely open about your situation in order to get to the bottom of what's wrong.  It is one of the most painful trips I've taken in life.  Exposing all of the grief I endured was agonizing but completely essential.
 Now, I am slowing getting a far better grip on life.  I will be writing blogs here for everyone to read, and I hope the help I got and the information I have will help even just 1 person.  Know this.  You are loved, but you have to love yourself.
 Bless everyone.
