As a child I was molested by my older cousin at first I didn't think of it like that cause she was a girl so am i and I thought only men could rape at the time she would fundle me and stuff and kiss me all nasty like with tongue and then one day we were alone and she pushed her fingers inside me I was in alot of pain and she stopped all together we never did it again a few years passed and she had become a christian and we talked and everything things just went back to normal and then one day I was just daydreaming and then I realized that I was molested as a child and I wondered how am I just realizing this and why now I felt stressed cause I would be in school and it would just pop up in my head all of I sudden I would always remember no matter how hard I try not to cause I do forgive her but I won't forget and that's what I want the most to forget and I just felt weird and stupid cause for all these years I was walking around like nothing bad has ever happened to me and judging people who would say they were raped and wouldn't tell and think they are stupid and now I just realized that I was robbed of my innocence as a child and didn't even notice until high school and now I feel terrible I'm not even sure if this is the right community for this I just needed to let it out
