Hello, I am 22 years old and have a problem.
 I've had this weird pain in what i think is my lower colon (specifically in my left center of my buttcheek). It is not tender at all but it's been very inconsistent. Generally I feel a lot of pressure and the need to use the bathroom. Even after a BM, the sensation is still there. It gets worse when I sit or when I'm under alot of stress. This is also accompanied by occasional lower abdominal pains. When i first had this, I was constipated for the first week so my GI sent me home with miralax and confirmed that it was not a hemorrhoid. I took these and began having somewhat regular BM's again but the pressure/pain in my butt is still there. I've been constipated plenty of time before and I can say it is not constipation pain.  It is not as bad as my first week but it is constantly there all day, bothering me. My stools are normal but have been narrow and long which freaks me out .I know it might be me being paranoid since I've read stuff on this.  I really don't know what to think at this point. I'll jump right to it, I'm terrified it can be cancer. If anyone with a similar experience can possibly shed some light on this. Thank you.
