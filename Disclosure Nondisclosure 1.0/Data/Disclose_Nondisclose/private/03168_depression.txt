I am a police officer, you know.. Big bad superman with no emotions. I was struck my a car a year ago and put off knee surgery to get back to work. A few months ago I was t-boned on duty by a car going 65 mph at impact( he was running from police) my chief wants to crucify me and is doing everything in the world find a way to blame me for the wreck even though I was complete cleared of any negligence after a highway patrol reconstruction and investigation. I have lower back disk bulging, disk bulging in neck compressing and rotating spinal cord and both knees are torn up inside. They have me on lortab, flexeril, celexa, Xanax, adderal , ambian , hydroxyzine, and zistril. I find myself isolated from the world, my fiancé is at the end of her rope with me and says she can't take it anymore and wants to have me committed due to irrational thoughts and falling in deep dark holes. I am to the point I just want Togo to sleep. I know I am not an unstable person but am petrified at who I am as of lately and just want to go to sleep and stop being a burden. My family is 900 miles away and I can't turn to them, all my brothers in blue have just faded away except for one who is trying to steal my fiancé I am just so tired and have sought mental help but that has gone no where yet. I can't help feel that all those Medicines at once are wreaking havoc with me emotionally can I just stop taking my meds..... I am just so exhausted mentally
