I am 30 and I have moved on with my life except for this one thing. When I was a teenager (around 15 or so to be exact) my mothers husband would go outside to smoke his cigarettes. My aunt stayed with us one time and caught him spying on us through the window. Turns out he had been doing this for a long time. He was very sneaky and acted like nothing happened. This went on until I moved out at 18.  I have confronted him on this right before I left. He acted like it never happen even though I caught him several times. I have two other sisters he did this to also. We made this known to my mother yet she was in denial at the damage it could do. My mother is still married to this man and we still have to run into him because he actually goes to the same giant church I attend with my family. I hate him for what he did and I hate how he has never has come to me as an adult to apologize for his behavior in the past. I might add that he has an addiction to porn to this day. I just cannot get past this. So my question is this, how do I get past this and is this classified as abuse? Should I expect him to ever come to me and say he is sorry? Until I get these answers I have to swallow my pride and hold back my anger. Help me understand please.
