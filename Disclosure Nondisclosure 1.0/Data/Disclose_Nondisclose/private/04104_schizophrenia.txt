Ever since I came back to college this semester, I've had a serious problem with depression, (I'd had a few pretty depressing events take place over the first month during and the summer prior). I noticed how I've been writing / speaking in confusing ways, as I'm sure you'll notice from this post. At one point, I took interest in a mental health quiz online, and scored major pts. in possible schizophrenia.. yikes. 
 Some things I've noticed about myself:
Speak / write in odd ways (my girlfriend describes them as Yoda-talk)
I'd often fantasize about being able to do things people can't do (maybe a way to escape the reality of my life)
I've noticed I can be sometimes almost emotionless and feeling mindless, and then I can also be overly emotional to the point where I am holding back tears... and most of the time these aren't caused by immediate outside influences.
I don't really hear voices.. though sometimes I feel like my personality changes depending on the mood I'm in .. (from being outgoing to socially awkward and withdrawn)
