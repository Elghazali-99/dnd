My mother has been emotionally and verbally abusive all my life, I am 40.  My father was a raging alcholic who would beat my mother as well as my brother and I.  As if it were not bad enough, she never protected my brother and I from my father and at 18 my father and I were in a physcial confrontation when I tried to break up a fight between them. I don't remember chunks of my childhood, and my counselors and doctor believe that I have blocked what may have been some very traumatic memories.  I do remember never receiving love, hugs, words of encouragement or support.  I was drinking, doing drugs, and very promiscuious during my teens.  At around 10 or so, I remember taking a bunch of tylenol and being disappointed when I woke.  Now my mother is on a mission to destroy the relationship with me and my daughter.  She has isolated me from family and friends and many of them believe me to be a neglectful mother.  Nevermind, that my brother is an alcoholic woman beater, he at one point even attacked me.  My mother was angry at me for calling the police after he assualted me.  I feel that it would be so much easier to confront my mother and then exclude her from my life.  It has been exhausting trying to figure out what I need to do to gain acceptance and love for this woman.  I often wonder if my conception was traumatic for her (my brother is 10 months older than me) and she blames me for that pain and having me as a daily reminder of that event causes her to hate me.  Being around her leaves me feeling empty, sad, and worthless.  My father is no better.  Is it better to move on with my life without them?
