As much as I hate the term that's what she calls herself. My husband had a child from a previous relationship. As soon as she found out about me she freaked and wouldn't let him see his daughter. She has let him visit from time to time but not much. My husband and I dated for a year and got married in June, it is still an issue with her and she hates me for some reason. Last night I went with my husband for the first time to meet his daughter and she threatened that she would leave or hurt me if I was to meet her, so he did his thing and I waited. I know she most likely still has feelings for him and that's the reason she hates me, I tried to talk to her and level with her so that we can meet up avoid issues and let my husband, myself and my son try to connect with his daughter as a family. She told me that it was no of my business and to stay out of it. I guess my question is do I have a right to be involved or do I leave it alone? I don't want to over step my boundaries but what is my role in all of this? Thanks!
