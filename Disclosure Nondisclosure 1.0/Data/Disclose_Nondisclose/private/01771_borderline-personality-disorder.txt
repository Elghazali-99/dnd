my son is 7 nand still dont talk at all not a word. All i really want is to hear his voice i will deal with all of the other problems we have, his ocd and behavior but it would help so much if he could just talk n tell me what he wants or whats wrong . What can i do whats the best thing for this problem ,is there meds because he isnt on any meds right now . His not talking is maken his behavior worse its get so bad at time we are afraid for his safety n ours he has black and blued me my eyes , bloodied my nose n lip, he goes after the other kids and hurts us we dont no what to do for him or to get him to stop at times his fits will last 1 hour or more.I used to always know what to do for him and how to make him stop but now i feel as if its out of my control just as much as its out of his i am lost and dont know what to do anymore.Its breaks my heart that i let myself get to this point and that i dont know what to do for MY son i cant make him happy. thank you for listening and please help us if u can.            Worried mom
