Please help me. I am a registered nurse with 3 children. I was married to a sadistic, horrific, horribly abusive man, who after 25 years, I finally divorced. I've been in therapy for 5 years with a very competent,kind and experienced therapist, who has helped me greatly. I started for anxiety disorder, panic attacks and PTSD. Last week, after discussing for the 100th time why did I stay in such an abusive marriage, he told me the answer. He said that I was the sadist, who through the defence mechanism of reaction formation, lived vicariously through my ex-husband. How can that be? I never hurt, wished harm or received any enjoyment from the pain and suffering of others. i just cannot accept that I am the sadist.Sadists are the lowest of the low and like leaches live off others and they don't deserve to live and neither do i. Since last week I have been profoundly depressed, not going to work and feel physically and mentally ill. I don't want to go back to therapy anymore, I feel ashamed and confused. Please help me to understand
