I'm almost done with my undergraduate studies. I still live at home with my parents, and I have a great relationship with them. They have always been very supportive of me. I also have a girlfriend of three years, and we plan on getting married once we're done with school. By all accounts, I have a great life. Yet, I have this uncontrollable anger that seems to have gotten worse in the past year or two. It completely takes over and I become irrational and hostile towards everyone and everything around me. I've never hit anyone and I don't think I will, but I also never thought I'd yell at my girlfriend or parents. I'm currently on Wellbutrin for my mild depression. It has generally helped my mood, but I still have some uncontrollable outbursts of anger. I'm tired of getting upset over meaningless things because I always end up hurting the ones that I love. The people in my life don't deserve to be treated the way I treat them when I get upset. I want to change so bad, but random things set me off and I can't think straight. As soon as I cool down I realize how stupid, irrational and ridiculous my reactions are. At this point, I'm looking for any suggestions at all so that I don't destroy my relationships and possibly even my career. Please help me find a way to be a better person
