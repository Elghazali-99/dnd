I used to feel like people were watching me as I played when I was a kid. One distinct time was in an upstairs bedroom and the feeling that I was being watched through the windows. 
 I also used to pick at scabs on my scalp until I would be missing small patches (dime to nickle size) of hair.
 I also grew up in a religious household where listening to "god's" voice was a good thing. I believed I heard from him at a few different times when young. I thought for sure one day that he was going to leave me a baby on our doorstep. I always wanted to have a baby for some reason. Possible bc my mother had 10 children. six are younger than me.
 Now as an adult I find that I worry ALOT. I also am very distrusting of men that I am in relationships with. So jealous at times that I search their phones, email accounts, bank accounts.
 From age 19-26 I was a dancer at a gentlemans club, which is a sign of an unhealthy mindset. It was an unhealthy decision for me for sure. I made quite a few mistakes sexually which I really regret everyday.
 I also used drugs with different friends. In my first marriage I wanted to commit suicide quite often and even had the place picked out that I would do it.
 I am now married with a daughter and a step son. I feel I am doing the best I ever have now. I am in college, maintaining a 3.8 gpa and the main worry I have is trusting people, feeling like I am being conspired against, and mood swings that range from very happy and pleased with my life to angry and wishing I could change my husband or myself or go run off and live alone. 
 Help.
