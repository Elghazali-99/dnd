I have struggled with depression for years and have the added frustration of being highly sensitive to meds, so have never been able to take the therapeutic doses of antidepressants. The latest one I was on was Cymbalta at 20 mgs/day. After several years, my depression was worsening so my doctor decided to put me on Viibryd. I had to wean off Cymbalta and had major problems due to the dizziness, so she kept me on Cymbalta 20 mgs and Viibryd 20 mgs for several weeks. At a routine appt, I mentioned a set of symptoms I was having that indicated seratonin syndrome, so she told me to stop the Cymbalta and increase the Viibryd to 40 mgs. This worked well for about 10 days, except for the embarrassing and distressing side effect of extreme gas and abdominal distress with occasional loose stools. Then I began experiencing dizziness daily. It started right after having a cervical epidural, so I blamed it on that procedure. But a week later, the doctors have ruled out the epidural as a cause and are thinking Viibryd may be the culprit. I had one day without any Viibryd with no change in the dizziness, but with the addition of wild dreams where I couldn't wake up and felt stuck between being awake and asleep, but in bizarre places. I've also had a weird sensation for several days of electric currents across my shoulders (similar to a TENS unit), mild headaches, burning eyes, foggy brain, and blurred vision. Has anyone else experienced these things with Viibryd? Is it the higher dose of Viibryd, the 2 days off of Viibryd, or both?? It has really helped with my depression, but I'm frustrated with the dizziness that has now reached a point of interfering with my job.
