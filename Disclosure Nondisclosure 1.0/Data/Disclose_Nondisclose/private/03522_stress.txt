My son is now 24 years old. He was suffering from depression three years back. He did not go to college for two months continiously. He was just sitting in a corner and not going out any where. He was started with depression medicine. Doctor gave him Mirtaz tabs and one another tab. After six months he suddenly stopped medicine saying that I donot require this medicine. After eighth months he was to start the same again. Now because he was bahaving too rude he is given Aripizol 10 mg one tab daily for the last one and half month. My son is also complaining scrutal pain. His weight is now 99 kgs. My daughter says his weight is increased because he stopped taking medicine suddenly. His harmones got disturbed that is the reason he is putting weight. Is it true. Whether the pain is because of depression. Whether he require to take any particular  medicine for the purpose of reducing pain and to balance his harmones. He says that he do not require depression medicine now. Whether Psychiatrist can suggest any such medicine. I want to know details about the harmonal changes. Whether pshycitrics can give medicine for scutal pain also.Please advise.
