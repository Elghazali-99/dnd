I get so irritated at so many things that I now have an anxiety problem, and I don't know how to control any of it!  I HATE it when people rattle their sacks at a store or in a car, or just plain sacks rattling.  I can't stand it when I am at a store and people just stand in the middle of the isles like they've never seen a store before!  They look around like they're in lala land, MOVE IT idiot!
 Then, when people don't pick up their feet, scuffle, scuffle.  Busy work noises drive me NUTS.  I can't even watch a program on TV if it is a show about a family or anything and they are doing something in the kitchen or are together at home doing something and there is "busy" noise.
 I can't stand loud talking people, or if people interrupt, I will literally walk away in the middle of a conversation before I bust them in the mouth.
 WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME!!!  Do I just hate people in general?  And, what do I do about this, because it's raising my blood pressure and I stay away from most places where there may be a crowd.
