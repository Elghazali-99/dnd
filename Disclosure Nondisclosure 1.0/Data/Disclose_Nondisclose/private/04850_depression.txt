So about 8 months ago I started developing all sorts of health issues, I spent my entire summer and every dollar I made trying to figure out why I could see my heart popping out of my chest, literally. Seemed like if I could figure that out maybe some of the other stuff would add up. The heart thing was accompanied with a lot of other issues, nothing crazy but debilitating to the point where I can't run workout surf have sex etc. without noticeable breathing difficulties chest pressure tightness and crazier looking heartbeat,  plus I feel beat up for days afterwards. 
 To this day I still don't have an answer to what exactly is going on with my chest, but I did learn something interesting recently. The first thing I wanted to look into was STD'S, it was the only health hazard I could think of when all this started. I informed doctors of active unprotected sex life and asked to be checked for everything. I'm not sure why herpes, one of the most common STD'S around would be excluded when asking for everything, but it was, and I was told that I was clean of everything. Fast forward through a summer of awkward sex due to other health issues a
