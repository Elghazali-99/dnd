I have a 15 year old daughter and she has been acting strange she will scratch her legs and arms back etc and she says ''I'm feeling some things crawling on me'' But there is nothing there she feels It most of the day and I know se has racing thoughts and she tells me the thoughts she Is having and It doesn't make sence to me at all. 
 She will also have very violent thoughts and she will act apon her thoughts and then she will seperate her self away from her friends sometimes and her family, she Is very paranoid sometime's she talks about the government and how everyone knows what she Is thinking. 
 She talks about growing special abilities such as stretching arms and killing everyone In one hit like she's the hulk or something. She takes alot of things to heart and will hold grugdes against that person for a long time. She will go In the garden for a cigarette and stay out there for ages In the cold and wind. She said to me one time she kept hearing really loud buzzing noises and she said but when she looks she can't see anything she could only hear it. 
 She self harms alot. If she gets Into a fight with anyone she won't stop untill she see's blood.
 Can someone PLEASE give me an awenser If this Is Schizophrenia or not? Or anything else?? 
 Thanks. -Chris Ellis.
