I'm a 60 yr old female, and I've never had a problem with cystic breast, however within the past week I've found a nodule in my right breast in the upper region. Is it normal to have any pain from it. I thought I had just pulled a muscle, but it continues to hurt. The pain has been there for about a month, however I just felt the module this week. It feels like a burning, and searing pain when I move my arm to either side and even forward Even when I turn my head, or slightly my upper body to the left when driving. Is this normal to feel so much pain? The first few times it happened, my co-worker said I turned very pale, and it's more disturbing now that I found the lump.
    Four years ago I had open heart surgery, and had a benign tumor, the size of a lemon, removed from my heart, and around it, with a stent put into the Aorta. A CT scan had shown a nodule on the right breast, but it was very small, and was also noticed on my last 2 mammos. I'm planning on calling for an appointment tomorrow with my GYN, and schedule my yearly mammo, but should I be worried? My mother's sister died from breast cancer that returned, and spread all through her body.This discussion is related to Lump on upper breast (chest).
