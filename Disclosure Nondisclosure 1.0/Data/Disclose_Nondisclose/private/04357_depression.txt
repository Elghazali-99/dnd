For the last year, and especially in the last month, I've been finding it very hard to become excited or happy about anything. Everything is either boring, or stressful, and I feel like I can't do 50% of what other people my age do. I feel like while other people can handle school, a part-time job, extracurriculars, friends, and family, I can barely handle the minimum. 
 I just feel so empty, and it's so hard to explain. It's like someone has cut a hole in my chest, and I'm struggling to hold myself together. I've alienated myself from my friends and my family without meaning to. The only thing that I try to do well in anymore is school, and even that is making me neurotic. Although I do well,  I have such bad anxiety over assessments and I get physically sick before every test or quiz. Nothing is ever good enough, and as much as I try to be blissfully happy, I feel weighed down. I think about my future, and when I used to think about all the fun things I would do, all the places I would see, now I can only think about school, university, and work. It seems endless and draining. I've been trying to stop being such a perfectionist and have fun with friends and family, but I can't stop. I'm constantly on edge and I'm never happy or content. I've been like this for a year, and I'm becoming more and more hopeless. I've told my mother about it, and it just made her upset. She reccommended that I start taking St. John's Wort, but it hasn't helped at all so far. 
 And the worst thing is, I feel bad about not being happy. I'm in my late teens, and I should be excited for the world and life. Nothing overly negative has ever happened to me, other than a few self-esteem issues. I know I should be happy, but as hard as I try, it won't work.
 What should I do?
Thank you for listening!
