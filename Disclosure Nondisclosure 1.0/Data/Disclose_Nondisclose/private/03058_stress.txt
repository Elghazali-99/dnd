Hello all,
 I am a poster from India and so for many in the West, my problems may seem a little strange.
 I am a 31 year male - hetrosexual, unmarried, not in a relationship. I was very happy being single. I have a good education, a good job, earn well, am well regarded in my line of work. All fine so far. Problem: in India, marriage is extremely important. By the age of 30 you have to be married and have kids or there is something wrong with you. My parents and all other relatives are constantly forcing me to get married. All my colleagues in my office are married. All my friends who were with me in college are married. Colleagues and friends who are married keep asking me when I am going to get married.
 Before, I used to just shrug it off and say after a few years. But honestly, I am just not a relationship type. All I like to do is work and read. I was happy and healthy. But things are getting too much to handle. I don't feel like visiting any of my relatives for that reason and am getting isolated. I feel like people just won't accept me or leave me alone the way I am now.
 I am having trouble sleeping, or rather I feel increasingly tired or sleepy during the day. My appetite has dropped and I'm losing weight. I am getting worried if all this could lead to depression or anxiety attacks if it continues for long. I couldn't find any such forums in India because simply put in India people don't struggle to stay single.
 Thanks.
