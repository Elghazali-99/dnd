My sister in law is 10. Her mother (the two were very close and she was the main caregiver as the father wasn't much help) passed away 5 months ago from cancer. She only fought it for less than 2yrs.
 Around the time the mother was in the thick of chemo, my SIL started to pull out her eye brows and eye lashes. Now that MIL has passed I noticed the other day that the skin on SIL's fingers and feet are peeling. I tried to get her to open up about why. She was very defensive, but in the end she did agree that it doesn't hurt when she peels. She still pulls out all facial hair. 
Her dad and sister do not talk about emotions or express grief about their great loss.
I am reaching out because I loved her mom and my SIL so much and if I need to intervene and suggest counseling for SIL if the peeling and pulling is a coping mechanism. I need to know if this would be too nosy.
Side note: I know her nutrition consist of white carbs, sugar, and tomato sauce. Very little protein consumption.
