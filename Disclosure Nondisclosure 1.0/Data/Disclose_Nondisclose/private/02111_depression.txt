Hi all. 
 I hate to post here but i have been worrying for a while that i may be suffering from either depression/anxiety or something else.
 Back in May i started to have a strange feeling in my legs as if they were like jelly. 
 They only felt like jelly when i was sitting down really and when i got up to walk they felt fine, no weakness at all. 
 I then developed pins and needles in my legs and feet at the same time as the jelly legs. At one point my toes on my right foot felt like i was holding them in a fire, this only lasted about 18 hours. 
 Around about a month later i starter to feel the jelly feeling in my hands and arms. 
 At times i would be holding my phone and would feel a jolt go through my hand and would drop the phone. 
 My right hand was also shaking quite a bit. 
 I was then presented with tingling in my face, lips, scalp and chest which was quite worrying. 
 After that i then started getting frequent urination which lasted about 3 weeks only to be replaced with a pain in my testicle and also around my rectum. 
 Next symptoms seemed to be a strange crawling in my back then the centre of my back felt like someone was holding a match to it this seemed to last a couple of days, i have also had back and neck ache for a couple of weeks too. 
 I've been to the doctor and they have done a lot of blood tests and all have come back fine. 
 Just wondering where i go from here and whether or not this sounded at all like symptoms of depression? 
 Hope you are all well and look forward to your views. 
 Regards 
 David
