I am not currently being abused, and have not been abused for a long time.  But I was sexually abused in my teen years.  I cannot give you the details of this because I find it that hard to talk about.  It was extremely traumatizing, and went on over a period of years, in different circumstances.  My problems are these: 1) I am unable to perform oral sex on my husband unless he remains perfectly still and does not touch me at all during the act, and I only do this very rarely anyway, due to past awful experiences with this.  Let me clarify that my husband has has NO part in the abuse I suffered.  He is very loving and understanding.  2) When I go to my gynecologist for regular checkups, I FREAK OUT every time: shaking, crying, and feeling terrified to the point where I take a sedative before I go, and that still doesn't help much.  I have to continually control my urge to scream and fight off the nurses.  3) I have a teenaged daughter whom I am VERY overprotective of because i do not want these things to happen to her.  I am suffocating her, and I can't seem to help it.  She refuses to listen to me when I want to tell her about predators and sexual abuse.  Any input you can give me is more than welcome.
