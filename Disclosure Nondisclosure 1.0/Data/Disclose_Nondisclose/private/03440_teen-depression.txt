I am not sure what to do anymore I think I might be losing myself. I am fifteen and I am going to tell you a lot about me so it might help you to figure out what's going on and I am going to be as truthful as I can.
So a bout four or five days ago me and my boyfriend had sex. Yes I know what you're thinking a fifteen year old having sex but I know I was ready. I love my boyfriend a lot so it ment a lot to me that he was willing to give up his virginity to me. So after two days of that and already being extremely late on my period I thought I might've been pregnant. I'm not really sure what happen there but I started my cycle today. Some friends said it might've been stress. I stress out ALOT. Okay and today I found out that my boyfriend was moving to Florida. So the first thing I think is oh my god this is all my fault. So of course I did what any other emo teenager like me did, I slit my wrists. I like the pain. It brings me pleasure. I guess that sounds very phycopathic but I do. So I go on with my day crying my eyes out every chance I got to where no one could see me and I was alone. I don't cry in front of people it's kind of embarrassing so I did it alone. I am considered a happy emo, for those who don't know what that is it is someone who pretends to be happy when really they are just hiding there pain. So after I found out my boyfriend was leaving I... Cut... Then after that all I could think was I love him but he doesn't love me... I know he loves me he says it all of the time so I know he does. So that really didn't make sence. Then all got extremely depressed and had a variety of graphical suicidal thoughts but then I snapped out of it by remembering how many people love me and need me in their lives so yeah I want your opinion..... What should I do??
Am I going crazy???
Do I need help??
