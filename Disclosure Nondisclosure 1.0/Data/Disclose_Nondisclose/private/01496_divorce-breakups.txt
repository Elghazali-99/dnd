I have been married for 20 yrs. 4 children, last one is a Jr in high school. In short here is my problem, My wife....she is little to no fun, has a bad temper, and is difficult to reason with. I'm not perfect, please understand, I get that also. But I have done everything I can, faithful, work a fulltime job for our entire marriage, been a good dad, work on our home,  do laundry, cook and try to stay in shape so my wife finds me still attractive. But I am not warm to her anymore....I find it difficult, in fact at times I say to myself "I can't stand her!" I want out but with my son still in the house its tough. I really want to do the right thing. My attitude is going down hill fast. I don't know if I can even wait until my son moves out. I don't think my wife is happy either, in fact she enjoys being unhappy I think. I guess, I tired of being lonely and down. Looking for any thoughts to assist in my next move. I'm 49 yrs old and understand that I have about 1/3 of my life left I finally feel that it might be ok to be selffish. Thank you for any feedback.
