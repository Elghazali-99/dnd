Hi,
Me and my boss are too close.
but the problem is he orders me and i follow his orders.the orders if dont get personal is ok for me
but since for the last couple of months i am doing whatever he says,i do feel i am gettin slavish or used by him
and also i cant oppose him.
there are much incidents but citing one,
the last time on an official tour,he ordered me to be pleasant with the clients,to get the deal in any condition
by doing whatever i could.
i did as he said with full dedication,i did expose myself,not wearing my undergarments,and i know
how ashamed i felt when i was alomost nude in that revealing bikini,treated them with full politeness and smiling behaviour,
and the clients were much impressed by my work.we did get the deal,but i was not tipped for that,all my boss enjoyed.
being the associate he should have tipped me,
because it was me who presented the deal in a different manner to them.on askin about my tip,i invited 1 more night
of troublesome sleep with him and he said that was my reward in return of the deal.
but the point is i m gettin hurt by his behaviour and orders,i dont know if he is abusing or using me.i m 
gettin deep emotional troubles and i am really ashamed of what i do.please help.
