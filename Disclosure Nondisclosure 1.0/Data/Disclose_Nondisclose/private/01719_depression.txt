Ok here's my concern. Over the past 18 months, I have been ill. After taking an antibiotic I start having horrible headaches. I was also diagnosed with hashimotos disease. When I would take my thyroid medicine, it would cause me to cry. I mean I would cry every day in the afternoon. My head hurt so bad, I could barely lift it. Ok, fast forward my doc found out I wasn't converting my thyroid hormones properly. He added cytomel which helped with the headaches. I had to have sinus surgery which went very well except I started having heart palpitations and internal tremors. Ok, I started taking xanax for only four days. When I started taking them, my head started hurting again and the crying spells started again. I'm trying to understand is this depression. My doctor thinks it is. Could crying spells, headaches and pressure be all signs of depression. I'm not sad, my family is awesome right now, but I can barely drag myself out of bed. I have searched the thyroid websites for months. I am now trying to except the fact that this is depression. Any thoughts? Please help.
