On days like this when the sun is shining and we have clear skies I get mixed emotions. I love the good weather but this is when most of my anxiety comes in. Everyone begs me to go outside and i just cannot do it.
Everyone throws on their summery clothes but for me there is so much thought process that has to go into it all. I don't get past the act of even dressing, never mind even going out the front door.
I have think of all my SH scars - which I know are my own fault. Any time I dress its 'no it wont cover those scars, or those stretch marks'. Fashion is impossible, short sleeves are a nono and I'm always wearing cardigans which are unbearable in the heat. 
 I know these are all very 1st world problems but this is normally the onslaught of a very down time for me and i wish I knew the tools to overcome all this. I'm currently in cbt for body image issues and ED but I'm not finding it helpful at all. I really want to enjoy this summer and not be a recluse. This has been the start of a long hard recovery but I feel a little demotivated and lost.
 Any feedback would be great.
