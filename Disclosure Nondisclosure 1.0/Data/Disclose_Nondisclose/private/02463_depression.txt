Iam heart broken tired and did I meantion heart broken. My thre boys have been my life. They are 17,19&6   I have been the best no I can be. Now looking back on my life as a mother I think needed them so much in my life. When they were happy when they were sad. I had to fix it. I have always been the fixer. Well I can't fix anything anymore. The two teens say I am crazy. And they mean it. When ever I have a emotion it's because I am nuts. Wtf I can't handle that one more time. I might hae to show them what nuts is. lol. Anyways my boy who is 17 moved out with friends and had a party place. Drugs he dropped out of school and he also got his first boyfriend. Now living as a gay man. I would not support him with the drugs and school and stepped out of his life and said I will not aupport your bad choices. That only lasted two months then they got kicked out. Now he lives on a farm for the last four months. I was happy for him. He was working going to school so I started to speak to him again. Now these people call him there son and he calls them mom and dad. I just got court papers saying they want cuatody of my son and child support and a restraing order against me. They have brain washed my sonto are me. They say I harass him threw texts. Every text I send says I love u i miss you i  proud you are my son. That us not harassment. My aon will not talk to me it has been months. These people have made me a horrible person to everyone who listens.  I am going into a deep dreppresion I can't breathe my hands go numb. I have hired a.  Lawyer to fight.  Iwill not allow someone to have custody of my son. And he moved out on his own. I don't have to pay support when he will not come home. And I will never stop telling my son I love him. So they can send me to jail if they think that is wrong. I just don't get how one day everything is happy and he says hebis leaving. And the next I am no longer his mother. I  heart broken and feel like a horrible person
