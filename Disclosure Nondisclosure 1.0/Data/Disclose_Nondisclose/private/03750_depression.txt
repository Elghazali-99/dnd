I have had a problem for years now that causes me to have no energy, no motivation, loss of interest, no desire to do much of anything/never leave the house, cant focus, anxious, depressed, and my head just feels fogged and messed up. Anyway, I have taken adderall for 6 months which has helped a little with the energy and focus but not much with anything else. I have been to many doctors and now a psychiatrist and they keep prescribing antidepressants. I first took lexapro which zombified me and had a bunch of other side effects too. The zombie effect is horrible though, I wouldnt wish that crap on anyone. Second antidepressant was wellbutrin and it helped for one week and then had no effect even with dosage increase and made my adderall ineffective. Last week was my first appointment with a psychiatrist who spent a whole 2 minutes with me and apparently from that 2 minutes knew the perfect antidepressant to prescribe cause "this one wont make you a zombie". She prescribed cymbalta and its doing the zombie thing again just not as bad as with lexapro but still bad. I called her office because she said to call if it made me a zombie and all they told me was to take it at night and it shouldn't cause that effect. It still does. I'll admit there have been a few hours here and there where my mind has felt more stable and like its working but that doesnt make up for the zombie effect i have now. I can barely type coherently right now cause my mind is zombied out. 
 Is this a normal thing with these meds or am I misdiagnosed? Doctors don't spend but 5 minutes tops with you no matter how much you stress your condition is causing you to not be able to function. I just want to feel normal, should I stick it out with this cymbalta or see a neurologist next or what?
