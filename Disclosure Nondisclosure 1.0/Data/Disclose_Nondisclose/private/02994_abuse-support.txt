To all my addict friends that are recovering out there:
 Everything changes when we get clean. Our senses that were dull on drugs will sharpen, food will taste great, we will really appreciate the sunrise or set,  we will begin to see what is really important - BUT - we will also experience the emotions in hyper-real!!!  It can be scary. My suggestion is not to listen 100% to our feelings right now because feelings are NOT ALWAYS FACTS. They are a God given emotion but they can be abused just like we did with the drugs. 
 When we feel restless, irratable, angry, sad or discontent we should just pause and say to ourselves ......
 God,,,,,grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change,,,,,,, courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.  Amen!!!   An easy prayer that really helps!
 I TELL MYSELF I CAN DO THIS,,,,I MUST NOT GET UPSET,,,,,,,THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS TO BIG THAT GOD CAN'T SOLVE FOR ME & THEN ASK GOD FOR RELIEF.      
 HE IS FAITHFUL !!!
 Remember that we caused this problem over a long period and it will take a period of time to solve the problem. 
 Remember that getting clean is not an event,,,,,, it's a tough by worthy journey!!
