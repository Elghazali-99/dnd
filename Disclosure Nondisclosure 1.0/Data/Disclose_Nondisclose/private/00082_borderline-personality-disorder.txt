My girlfriend broke up with me over a year and a half ago and I'm just as crushed as I was the day she did. I put her through so much. She saw me go from uncontrollable rage to pathetic crying spells. There were times that I wouldn't have sex with her or even touch her then I couldn't keep my hands off her. I would laugh and play with her son one second then I'd scream at him for even touching me. I put her through the BPD crash course for sure! The day she dumped me she said I really deeded to get help so I promised her I would. The truth is the main reason that I'm getting help is because I didn't want to break my last promise to her. She'll never know and I'll never see her again but I still want to get better because I promised I would try. She probably cringes at the thought of me and I don't blame her at all. I have nothing bad to say about her. I go back and fourth with almost everyone else in my life but, not her. I haven't been with another girl since. I was In bed with a girl and just couldn't do it because I kept thinking of my ex girlfriend. I keep screwing up every chance with another girl because I always think of her. I don't know take this. Is this just the over the top emotions of BPD? Is this just my mental problems causing me to feel an emotion that's not really there? Or do I deeply love someone that I drove away and I'll never see again?
