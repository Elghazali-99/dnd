Right now I just want to go curl up in a small dark place cry and cry and cry close my eyes and never wake up. were no one can find me or disturb me. I hate my self win a passion. I'm so increadibly annoying. My oppinion to anything dosent matter it's worthless. And if I were to die people might be sad at first but in the long run they would be much happeir because I wouldent be here to couse so much trouble or to be so annoying. I have tryed twice. And thought of going to sleep and never waking up is really comforting. Because I wouldent have to wake up and deal with all the drama. I wouldent have to deal with all the annoying things I do. I also hate my body I feel I am fat. I hate my stumic. I am 5 foot 10 and weight 150. I know I'm a healthy weight but I'm discusting. Everything about me os discusting from my persanality and how I act to my body. I hate everything about my self. And I know everyone around me can't stand me either. Because I annoy the living crap out of them!!!! This extremly deep hatred for my
self started last summer when my step brother was hit by a truck. He was walking 2 girls home so they wouldent drink and drive ao no one would get hurt. Well so much for that. I moss him and wish I could talk to him. He loved his life and might of been able to help me love mine. I hated my self befor he passed to but since he passed last augest it has become un bareble. At least nefor he died I had a good self estemete now I can't stand my self and hate everything about my self!!!!!!
