for a the past four or so years I've been going between these downs. I used to do things that were self destructive. For awhile i couldn't stop thinking about disappearing  or committing suicide. Although i never acted on these. But now its 2 years later and i feel so sad and irritable. My sadness is different then before. Now I don't even try to do things that will stop me from being sad. I don't go out with my friends anymore. I feel like I don't matter to them and they kind of don't matter to me. I only see my boyfriend. I'm doing well in school but it doesn't matter to me. My boyfriend is the only person who even knows that I'm not as happy as I seem. But i know it really hurts him to see me even remotely upset. I feel so bad that I'm hurting. But I'm so used to lying about how I really feel and think that I can't actually get even hint that I need help. Deep down I feel that if i get helped i wont have anything that makes me different and I deserve to be sad( although I don't know why). I feel so lost all the time. I can't tell ANYONE how i really feel. 
I hate telling people how I really feel because I've had some bad experiences with it. I never say it right and I don't come off the way I want to. I just feel like i'm so lost. I don't even really know why I do anything anymore. I don't know why I'm writing this.
