Hello,
I've been wanting to go to this concert for about a year now, I saved up enough money for me and my sis to go. The tickets are expensive, and tbh I think we deserve to treat ourselves to something we both enjoy. I saved all the money by selling items that I bought on my own at the time, and sold them to ebay. You don't know how happy I was that I saved all my money on my own to possibly buy these tickets. My grandmother found out somehow how much I saved and told me that it's a waste of money, and not to buy the tickets. And now that she knows I have this amount she wants me to help her with bill and things. I'm upset I can't believe this, do you think it's right of her to actually look and see how much money I saved? And should I not buy tickets for this event. I'm just upset.... :(. I'm 20, I go to college, I take care of my grandmother, I don't ask for anything in return. What do you think of the situation? And what should I do? I'm depressed right now, cause she called me mean names, and told her to leave her alone. Now I feel bad...I got diagnosed with something that turned my world upside down about 1 year ago. I thought it would be nice for me to end my summer with an awesome concert!
