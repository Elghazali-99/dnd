I've never met my real father but the man I call dad now is the only dad I've ever known. He came into the picture when I was about 1 I think and has been in my life ever since. When I was about 3 or 4 I used to sleep in my moms bed with her. My dad uses to live outta town and would come to visit on the weekends. What would happen was, at night when I was asleep, I'd wake up terrified to the sound of my mom moaning. At only 3 yrs old, I didnt understand what was going on. I'd hear my mom making awful sounds with a dazed look on her face and my dad above her looking like he was hurting her. I'd cry and cry and yell for him to stop hurting my mom but of course he wouldn't listen. So I'd cry myself to sleep feeling so helpless and confused. Now that I'm older, I understand completely. And at times when ever the topic of my parents having sex comes up I get angry because of what I remember as a child. I'm 20 yrs old now and its really hard for me to show any type of respect towards either of my parents. I was never touched and never saw anything as far as body parts. But now that I understand what was really going on next to me as I slept in that bed, I can't help but wonder if that was some type of sexual or child abuse because whether or not a child understands at that very moment, sex just isn't something they should see or hear.
