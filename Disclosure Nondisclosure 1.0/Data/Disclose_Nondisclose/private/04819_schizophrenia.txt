I do not understand why I feel this way I do not understand why or how this all started. I do not know why my brain insist on making me be the woman that I am. I tell my children that I am sorry for being mentally ill. I do not want to go to a phycologist or whatever because, I am scared that they might admit me. I think about my kids and I know that if I do something stupid they will have nobody no mother. I use to go to college years ago and I told myself no mater what I go through hang in there. I have racing thoughts a voice tells me that if I just do it now all the pain will go away and that it is the best thing to do. I grab on to my blankets and tell myself no no that would be so selfish what about my family? I then realize I need to take my Prozac 10 mg. Because, if I do not take my MEDs I will hurt myself lately I have been feeling so strange and I feel worse if I skip a day of my MEDs. I just want to know why am I like this? what happen to me to where I am like this?
