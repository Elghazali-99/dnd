I had sex about almost 3 months ago, my boyfriend didn't ejaculate at all and we did use protection, except at the very beginning when he "put it in", without protection, once, which maybe could have had prejaculation? I felt nauseous about a week after, but I've always had stomach problems with constipation etc because of my anxiety, but never have I gotten so nauseous, but maybe it's because I've never been so anxious about something. I got my period normally that month, 3 days a little heavy then 2 days on the lighter side. I still took a pregnancy test after I finished my period and it came out negative. I was still feeling a bit nauseous later on and my boobs were sore, but I'm not sure if they're just growing because mine aren't very big and I'm around the age where they should be filling in more.  I took another pregnancy test about 2-3 weeks later and it also came up negative. My period has been pretty normal except a little lighter than before I had sex for the first time, but it lasts for 5 days like usual and is dark red and still a little on the heavy side. What worries me is that I've been looking up a lot about if you can get your period while you're pregnant and many women commented that they did have normal periods, then again it may be false as it is the internet but it still kind of scares me. I took my third pregnancy test about a month ago and my fourth pregnancy test about 2 weeks ago and they both came out negative but I am still very stressing and out and very anxious and worried about it. And my boobs are also still sore at time, especially my nipples.
