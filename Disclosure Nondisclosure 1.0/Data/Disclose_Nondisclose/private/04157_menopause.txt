I am 49 and pretty certain I have been Perimenopausal for about 4-5 years.  This year has been the worst by far.  I had labs done and my progesterone is low.  My doctor put me on plant based progesterone cream, but no help.  I am trying to avoid HRT, due to having a family history of Cancer.  My mom died from ovarian cancer two years ago.  I need to try something however, as I have zero life and feel God awful all the time now.  I have tons of symptoms but by far the worst are: hot flashes and night sweats, dizziness and vertigo, haven't had a period for almost three months and before that they were all over the map, anxiety and depression, panic attacks, constant gas and bloating in upper stomach, food intolerances, adrenal surges (I do have adrenal fatigue that had gotten way worse since going into Perimenopause), heart palps, tachycardia, POTS/Dysautonomia (that only started after the other Peri symptoms started), reflux, weight gain, rapid aging, extreme fatigue, horrible muscle and joint pain all over, and bacterial vaginosis that my gyno says is due to the haywire hormones.  I am going to try acupuncture and maybe some Chinese herbs, but just wondering if anyone else has any natural or alternative recommendations.  Thanks.
