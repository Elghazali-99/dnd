I have melanoma stage 3c.  I am getting ready to start high dose interferon.  I have read a lot about people and their treatment, but everything seems to be a few years old.  I would love to hear stories that maybe a little more current.  I had my surgery in Jan (radical neck and shoulder dissection).  I have a beautiful scare on my neck and shoulder now.  Moving my neck is very hard, but I am getting better each day.  I had a port placed into my arm and that slowed me down just slightly.  I will start tomorrow with interferon and will have to start off 5 days a week for 4 weeks, and then 3 times a week for 48 weeks.  So, far the worst thing about all of it is the surgery has been hard to recover from.  All my doctors say that I am doing great.  I had my surgery on my left side and it has made me walk and sit uneven.  Since I am uneven my right side has even become affected, because it has to make up for my left side.  I tell you what the pain isn't fun at all!  Any insight on going through your journey with melanoma would b great.
