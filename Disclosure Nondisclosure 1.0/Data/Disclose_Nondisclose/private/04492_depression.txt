Hi. I'm 17 years old and I think that I need some sort of help.
 Basically, my parents divorced when I was in year 7, so when I was 11 years old. I got so upset and got a little depressed but got over that quite quickly. SInce I was about 14 I started seeing things and hearing people talking when I am at home alone. Recently, I have started seeing things that cannot move, move. Like the lightswitch on the wall, it started moving up and a picture on a page started moving, I then asked the person next to me if it was and they said "No". Also I have begun to feel a little abnormal, and that started since my mum and step-dad started arguing, I would think things like "If I kill myself, they would not care, they wouldn't miss me". I am also easily irritated and my brother is the worst one to irritate me. Whenever he does, I always think "Imma kill you tonight".
 It generally makes me upset to think those sort of things and I can literally burst into tears at any point just by thinking about certain things. 
 I need help, and fast
