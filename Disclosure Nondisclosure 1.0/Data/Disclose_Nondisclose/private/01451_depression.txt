My boyfriend of 6 months is wonderful in so many ways.  But every so often (and more often, recently) he will lash out when I approach him in a tender way.   The first morning we ever spent together after a lovely night, he returned from the bathroom. I went to hold him and he snapped, "DON'T TOUCH ME!  I'M TRYING TO SLEEP!".  I laid in bed and stared at my ceiling fan, in shock.  When he woke up again later he explained that he is grouchy in the morning.  I let it go.  A month or so later I went to kiss his neck while he was grabbing a suit out of his closet. He dismissed me coldly with "NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME!". I chalked that up to him just being focused on what he was doing and not wanting to be distracted.  Just recently we were out having dinner and I went to stroke his hair.  He told me in a purely disgusted tone "DON'T EVER TOUCH ME WITH YOUR DIRTY HANDS WHILE I AM EATING!".
 When he is not snapping he is romantic and has the warmest smile.  He spoils me and I know he is faithful.  But it's almost like he has some kind of emotional Tourette's syndrome.  It's so off-putting and disturbing it makes me afraid of approaching him in a romantic/sexual way.  I care for him but I feel so hurt when he lashes out at me.  Am I being too sensitive?  Doesn't everyone get grouchy every once in a while?  Is there something I can do to circumvent this?  
 Any advice/perspective would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you in advance.
