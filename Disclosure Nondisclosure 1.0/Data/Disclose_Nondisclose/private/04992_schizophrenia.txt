I am writing in regards to my sister, Jill. She is 22 years old and lives with my mom. 
 Jill seems to be losing it. She is starting to think everything is “fake” or a conspiracy theory. As soon as she gets home, she walks in the house and goes through everything - like photo's and papers, looking for “proof.” She thinks my step dad is “in on it.” I live in another state and spoke to her on the phone the other day, my mom told me after she hung up with me, she said “That wasn’t really my sister.”  She thought someone was living in between the upstairs and the downstairs in a very small space, basically in the floor.  She is constantly looking at and studying things.  She finds “fake” things, puts them in bags and carries them around with her.. 
 Around the time this all started is when her boyfriend stopped talking to her (they’ve been on and off for years.) Now she thinks him and his friends have tapped her phone – cell and home, she thinks they have cameras planted in the house, and they come in, move things around, and spy. She has tore up the entire house, her computer, everything looking for "proof."  She keeps her cell battery out unless she's using it.
 My mom finally got her to go to the hospital where they have a psychiatric ward and they wanted to admit her, but she didn’t want to stay. They said they didn’t have enough to force her to stay.  They put her in an out patient program, but now she won’t go back. 
 What can my mom do to help her if she doesn’t want to get help? 
What can be causing this? 
 My mom strongly believes it is not drugs, but I am wondering if drugs are a factor.  I know she is not sleeping much, so it could be insomnia.  Any help is greatly appreciated.
