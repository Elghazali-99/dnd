I need to write a letter for a dear friend of mine in the custody battle of her 4yr old daughter. I need to know what topics are relevant. Do i speak of my friends fiance who has raised this child since she was 1yr old? Or is the courts only interested in the biological parents?
Can anyone give me examples as to demonstrate what i feel and have seen in the parenting? She and her fiance are absolutely a strong team together, nurturing parents, communicative, organized, and encouraging toward the children. But i seem have a writting block. i have been writing and writing, but dont seem to get out what i want to say. it ends up being a long page of simple and predictive  words. 
What does the courts want to hear about? what the mother is like? what the child is like? how this will effect the child if the biological father and her are introduced? Do i mention statistics and facts about social development at that age and whether it would good or bad for her?  I dunno,, i just need help! I have so much to say but need dont know how to say it or what is even relevant to the case. i end up going on and on, then i earase all my work cause i dont stay on topic. But what is the topic i need to stay on? OMG, u see how flustered i get? rrrrrrrr.... help.... asap. thank u to anyone who responds.
