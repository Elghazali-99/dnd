Im a bit embarrassed. Please don't be rude.. I'm an 18 year old male. And on December 9, 2015 was the first time I ever did anything sexual. This girl asked me to finger her. Before doing so we were making out and I got excited and I got erected. When that happened my penis felt uncomfortable so I had to stick my hand down my boxers to move it to the side and I felt this wetness I thought either it was Precum or sperm because the day before this happened I was wearing the same boxers and had masterbated and came in the same boxers. So I had on those same boxers when I was doing stuff with her. So after I was done fingering her I remembered. I told her and she got mad. She was supposed to get her period the last week of December. The 27th or 28th. She didn't she just got cramps and we thought she was pregnant. 5 days passed and she still didn't bleed so on January 2, 2015 she went to take 2 pregnancy tests at planned parenthood they came out negative. She ask the nurse why she didn't get her period and they gave her this pill and said that she should start bleeding after she took it  and two days later she did start bleeding. 3 days after she stopped bleeding And on January 8, 2015 we took 2 more tests to be safe and they came out negative to. We took one final test on January 22, 2015 and it was also negative. my questions are , Can she get pregnant by that? And was her period just being irregular?
