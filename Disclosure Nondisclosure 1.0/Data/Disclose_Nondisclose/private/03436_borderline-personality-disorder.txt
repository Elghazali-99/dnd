I just feel so fake. I hate the fact that I seem to become whoever I think that I need to be at the time. Eventually the real me comes out and that's not a person but, shell of a real person. I pretended to be normal my whole life and in the end, I just feel fake. I feel like I'm going to explode! I've lost everything. I love my psychiatrist and I love my counselor but at times I don't think they understand how crazy I am! They both think that I'm really just a nice guy and I am. I can also be a persons nightmare. My mood swings and violent temper have cost me a girl that meant the world to me. I can't stop getting angry with everyone for everything. I feel like I can't do this anymore. I just don't think that I can keep trying to fit in to society. I'm almost done. I can't seem to find a job or even be polite to anyone anymore. I don't know who I am and I can't seem to figure out what if anything I can do with my life. I talked to my doctor about being committed and she said that I'm doing a lot better than I give myself credit for but, I can't do this anymore. I'm sitting here writing this and I keep wondering what I should do. Should I try to get on some kind of disability? Should I devote the majority of my time to getting the help for the issues that I have?
