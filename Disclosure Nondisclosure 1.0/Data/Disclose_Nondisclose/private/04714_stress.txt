Hi, I am 35 years woman married and  have 3 kids.
Everything was ok to me and after i delivered my 3rd child (18 months) i stopped workimg.
 Few months ago I started to feel a quick heart bit in middle of my chest (82 till 100 sometimes) and sometimes i feel a tremor inside my body.Doctors said that there's nothing but stress!
 2 months ago at the same day of my period menstruation i got tired and next day suddenly I had nausea and lost my appetite and felt weak like hell.
 this situation last 2 weeks (on and off appetite) and feeling sometimes down and depressed like don't know how to spend my day and i started to think about each minute how to spend it and I look to other poeple and think how they are spending their time? all tests were done (blood test including theroid) and all came normal thanks god!
 Since that time and because I didn't know why it happened I feel scared and sometime can not sleep from my heart rate and when i sleep a inconcient movement from my hand or leg wakes me up... I went to doctor and thought that i am depressed or having anxiety but he told me it's not this !
 My issue now that sometimes I think about the time and feeling scared to go through the same experience!!! am dreally scared!! and sometime am not enjoying anything just from thinking about what happened!
 I am healthy thanks God but need to enjoy this and stop thinking and beeing scared... a Homeopath doctor told me that this could be from some defencie of some vitamins or minerals and could be from my stiff neck and shoulders which cause nervousness.
 What to do to be not nervous anymore and not to think about what happened to me.
 by the way, doctor told that when have any sickness we need time to recover and this is my issue now that i had this incident but need time to feel good after it.
 Please need advice..
