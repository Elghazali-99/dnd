Hi y'all, 
 I've been struggling with clinical major depressive disorder/ anxiety for 11 years and have been on multiple meds. At this time
I'm on lamictal, Wellbutrin, Klonipin, and cymbalta (treating to detox off and try fetzima). I am only 27 and just want relief. I've been on Klonipin for 4 years ( far too long) and I am at the point where I only take it to avoid getting sick with  withdrawal. Me and my husband would eventually want kids but the detoxing off these medications seems to be the scariest part and the only thing that is really holding us back (other than the total lack of libido) . I've been attempting detox from cymbalta for a few weeks but I can't go more than 2 days without caving in because the withdrawal is so awful. I am so scared for the future and it would be absolutely impossible to take time off work to deal with this. I need any advice on dealing with withdrawal symptoms from cymbalta!!! And if I should even consider trying fetzima. There is little to no information on the possibility of withdrawal disorders on it. I'm so lost and afraid that I don't know what to do please help!!!
