Ok, last night my husband and I got into a fight. 
Here's the story....
The other day we had a morning appt that we both had to attend and I scheduled it before he had to report to work. During the meeting he mentioned that he took the day off and was going golfing. I had no idea he was off before then. After the meeting, I asked when he planned this and he said that it was just planned in way to meeting because it was going to be a nice day and his cousin called and asked if he wanted to go. Ok, later on that day I asked if he had his clubs in the car, he said yes but only because he wanted to go to the driving range after work. Fishy to me, but I dropped it. Now last night I was folding laundry and I saw his golf shirt and shorts in the mix. He went to meeting in his work clothes, came home in his work clothes. So, I asked him about it. I asked why they were in laundry why did you have them in car randomly if there was no plan to go golfing? He gave me a smirk and I said busted and walked down stairs. After about a half hour he came out off our bedroom and asked if I was mad. I said you lied to me. He then went off. He swore up and down he didn't lie, I didn't believe him....long story short he got physical with me and I left for awhile . When I came home he blamed me and my "issues" for him getting to that point. I don't know what to do. Believe me, I'm not perfect, I do cause trouble sometimes but this wasn't me this time. And he can't seem to understand that getting physical isn't ever allowed, I called him out on lying to me and really just wanted to know why, instead I got the blame....soooo fusterating!
