Recently I told the truth to the love of my life and I asked her out and she said yes,
I kept it hidden that I love her for 2 years
When me and her started talking about if we want to ever get married later on she brought up her dad and started crying
 I asked her what was wrong and she said that her dad sexually abused her last summer and that she is terrified of him
 Altought she Is my girlfriend and I had no right to as her
I asked her what he did to her
She told me he did everything
Anal Sex
Oral Sex
Intercorse...
 She said he did it all...
I felt heartbroken for her and I tried to comfort her the best I could
Eventually I made her happy again
 Due to that she suffered from sever depression she was never really happy at all
But until she met me and we started going out she absolutely adores me and loves to spend all her time with me
 The problem is...
She lives in Minnesota
And I live in new york
And
She's 13 (almost 14)
And I'm 16
 I know it sounds wrong but please understand me that she is everthing to me and she is the literal definition of beauty to me
Her mom knows and she sorta trusts me and she is starting to like me and her step dad likes me a lot and has a lot of nicknames for me
She is the most amazing girl I have ever met and I don't want her past bothering her....
Or mine...
 I will admit that I have gone through much worse and she knows it
I wasn't even supposed to have been born because before I was born my mother had 14 abortions and I was supposed to be aborted but she missed the appointment
I was born without a father because he left the day I was born
My mother was a drug/alcohol/party girl type of person and she forgot about me... I raised myself and I went through hell doing it
Until 2007 when my mom started abusing me and torturing me
She would chase me around the house with a butchers knife calling it a "game"
She'd hit me over the head with anything wooden boards, metal poles... You name it
She would tie me up in the basement and tell her friends that I wasn't home when she had them over
She purposely told the doctors I had medical issues so they would prescribe medications that I did not need and she would use the $5000 support check they sent every month to buy herself clothes, food, TV's, laptops, furniture and anything else she could waste the money on for herself
I stood up to her on Christmas morning and I am still surprised that I am alive to tell you about it
I woke up christmas morning and I got into a fight with her
I was only wearing a blood stained T-Shirt and grey boxer shorts
It was blizzard conditions outside and the state warned not to go outside
There is only one door to the house and she picked me up by my neck and through me outside and locked the door
The only person that cared for me lived to miles away and that was my grandmother
I walked for two miles in the snow just begging for something to kill me and with every step it left a blood stained footprint behind me
When I reached my grandmother she screamed and called 911
I fainted and when I woke up I was in the hospital and the doctors said they were shocked that I was still alive
That day my mom left for Florida and my grandmother gained custody of me
 I've gone through tons of consoling for this and I have made a successful recovery
To this day they still haunt me though...
 My girlfriend means so much to me because she knows that all my life I have been bullied and denied by all other girls
But she is perfect
I could never ask for anyone better
But due to what happened to her I don't know if it will affect our relationship
 She says when I'm 21 and she is 18 that she wants me and her to by a house in upstate New York and leave everything behind and just live together
She wants a family as well but she does not want to adopt a child nor does she want any medicaly modified pregnancy
She said she wants to have a child through normal intercorse and I am afraid of that because I don't know if it will hurt her too much
 I swore that I would never hurt her in my life and that I would be by her through anything
And I don't want her being hurt by the memories of her father by me having intercorse with her in the future
  Please help me,
I love this girl and I would never take another over her
 I have to know how I should handle this
 I don't want to leave her
 Any advice at all means a lot!
Thank you
