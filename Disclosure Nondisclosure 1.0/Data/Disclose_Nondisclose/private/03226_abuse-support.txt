hi everyone im new on here. My life years ago was bad. I sortted my self out and 4 years into living a normal life i met and old friend that i had known for years who had. had the same probs. But we started going out and  are now married. I love him so very much.  my problem is that he wont let go of my past. Hes always reminding me of stuff ive done. I never leave his side as he is worryed that i might do something that he doesnt know about. I never go out the house and when he does the
door is locked. He has also hit me loads of times over this. Id just like to say i have never cheated on him and love him very much. I just dont know what to do. He says he loves me so why cant he love me for me and stop obsesing over my past and past relationships. Well sometime it feels like every thing ive done is wrong. He can be very loveing when he wants to be. But then he just changes. Ive gave up everything and  all friends and family tobe with him and i feel so alone. Nd the thing that really gets to me is he  help this girl upstair from us all the time. And i have to trust him. Why cant he do the same i am his wife. Anyone please help im feeling so alone and somedays i just want to die it feels like  the only way out.as i dont want to be without him but i just ant him to love me for me.
