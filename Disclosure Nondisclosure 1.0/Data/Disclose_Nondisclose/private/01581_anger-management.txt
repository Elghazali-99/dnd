Alright for a few years my mom and i have had a love hate relationship. She was in a car accident back around 2003, im 18 now so it was around when i was 12. after the car accident she would always be on meds so she would be drugged out, she would always yell to me to get her this get her that. We wouldnt do things anymore that she couldnt do, and she would get mad when we did them.
 So that when on for a few years, now she got off the meds and is doing better, but there is still so many things she does i cant stand that makes me SO FREAKING ANGRY like more than normal, i feel like i have all this built up hatred. I can go off to no end on so many things that makes me SO MAD(that she does). I just cant stress over the internet.
 So what im asking from a psychology point of view, whats it called when someone gets hurt like a car accident, and another family member becomes Hostile/critical towards them?
 I know i probably sound like a real low-life, but i would be lying if i said i didn't have these feelings. At first i thought i was bipolar but it really is just around my mom. I am negative, in a bad mood, and always curse when im talking to her.
 I will never physically hurt my mom.
 Besides my mother issues : /  , i get stressed very easily by other things, for instance if something isnt working ill get so enraged about it, if its a remote ill smack it or throw it across the room. I used to bite the side of my pointer finger on the left hand just to get my anger out( i know weird, better than cutting which i would never do), i can still see where i used to do it.
 I just feel i get easily enraged, and that my mom is one big trigger for it.
