I had a CT scan 3 yrs ago for abdominal pain and a 9mm "cyst" was found.  I just did a MRI on Friday and am told it is now 13 mm.  Just wondering if this is something I should be extremely worried about.  I've had an aunt pass from pancreatic cancer 3 months after dx.
 This is the email my dr sent me...along with the radiology report.
 Yes the cyst was 9 mmm so now a bit bigger see full report below, you can call radiology for getting images on a disc for you.
Yes surgery dept will call you for a consultation if you do not hear from them in a week call me, also you can directly call modesto gen surgery department.
Please feel free to book a phone apt if any questions.
Sincerely
