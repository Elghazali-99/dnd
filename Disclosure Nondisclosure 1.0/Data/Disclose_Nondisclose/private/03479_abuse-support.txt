I am storing my most expensive wordly goods at my sister's home in another state. Before moving to where I am now, I rented a 19 foot truck, which I planned to drive to my new home 1400 miles away from my sister's place. She agreed to the time and the date of my move, so I could get my stuff out of her house. When I gave her a reminder call about the move, she was screaming at me over the phone stating she did not want the 2 burly guys I hired in her house to cart out my stuff because "they would get the floors dirty and nick the walls!" I stated the guys would wear shoe covers and reapply new ones with each trip in and out of the house. I also assured her I would pay for the fixing of any nicks that might occur. She adamantly refused. My stuff is in a walkout basement. I offered to have the guys cart the stuff out the large sliding door of the basement. She adamantly refused again stating they would mess up her landscaping and trample the grass! I agreed to pay for any damages that might occur. She then said, "Well, I guess you'll just have to leave everything here and move with what you have!" How do I handle her? Her moods change from minute to minute. I lost my job due to unforeseen bad health and need to get the stuff to sell so I have food to eat! Help!!!
