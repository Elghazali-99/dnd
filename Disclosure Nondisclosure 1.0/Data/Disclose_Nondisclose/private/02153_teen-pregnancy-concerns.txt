Hey I have a question and im really scared that I might be pregnant... my period started Dec 4 and ended the 8th ... me and my fiancée are really active annd we had unprotected sex right after I got off my period and he came alot inside me... well I didnt think I could get pregnant right after my period... so I didnt worry about it.. until we had unprotected sex on Dec 17 and 18... he came inside me again (not trying to get pregnant) I checked my calendar it say i am fertile on the 17th and ovulating on the 18th... I would curremtly be 2 weeks pregnant if i am.. I took a pregnancy test on the 20th and 22nd it came out negative... I am having tingly nipples and peeimg sorta more... sleeping alil more.. cramping lightly every once in a while... get hungry a little more... and I have these dark blue veins popping out on my chest and down to my boobs and nipples... my periid starts  jan 1... I dont know what to do... can I b pregnant or what? My test came out negative... HELP :( oh and I been sorta moody.
