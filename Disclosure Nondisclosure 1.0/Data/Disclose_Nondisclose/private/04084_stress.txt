My younger siste, whom I amm very close to was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer 5 yrs ago in her mid 30's. The cancer keeps coming back and she keeps fighting. She has another PET scan tomorrow because her tumor counts are up again. I am so worried. She has been through so much since the cancer came. The diagnosis was a month after her marriage and she  and her husband split because he had not signed up for the cancer. He left her with the house and it is now being forclosed on. She has had to work through everything because she pays for her health insurance. Throughout this she has always been strong. I don,t know how to help her , nor  do I feel strong enough. I myself have marital and financial problems, as well as a severely disabled adult child to care for. I am so afraid. My mother, whom is an emotionally aloof person, is in denial. My mother, sister, two half sisters , were severely physically( not sexually) abused by our father. My sister always ran to my mother's side to protect her while I hid . My sister does not like to speak of it . She just says it helped her learn what people are capable of.  She is so strong. We have kind of been like a mom to each other, and our mom like our child. I love my sister so much and am so worried. I don,t know what to do or what to say. I will be there for her. I wish I had called her tonight, but I did not want to make her sad. She said she does not want to be babied but I know she is afraid. I think she thinks about suicide sometimes, but I don,t think she will go there. I think my mom worries about it too, because my sister is so organized., and is a planner, but cancer has all the control - it is up and down, and all over I guess writing this made me feel a little stronger, but I have deep dread inside. I need to find strength. My sister and I are agnostic so prayer  doesn't really help us, though we respect others spirtuality. How do I find strength?Can you help me to comfort her or at least  just say the right things?
