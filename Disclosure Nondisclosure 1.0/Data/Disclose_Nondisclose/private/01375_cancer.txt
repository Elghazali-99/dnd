Hi all,
I had an MRI scan on my Trigeminal nerve because of ATypical Trigeminal Neuralgia symptoms, numb face on one side, sharp pain on same side etc. My neurologist called and said there was a white shadow on my mandible and ordered me a bone CT scan because they are not sure if it is in the bone or in the Trigeminal nerve, and if the bone whether it is in the bone marrow. I am waiting on results of the CT scan.
My question is, if it is not the nerve and is the bone or bone marrow, what could cause this?
Note, I do not have any kind of tooth ache, or sore gums etc. I do have a missing tooth on that side on lower jaw, but it has not bothered me for over 6 years.
I am also getting swelling under my jaw every morning, pain under my ear along jaw line with swelling and one side of my face the cheek is a little swollen (all these are on the left side of face only) I've had palsy before and just thought it was residual effects from that even though the palsy was 2 years ago. Also getting or have had, left side rib pain in the morning, bad burning throat after drinking alcohol, but not always, just when I drink beer, numb fingers periodicly itchy arms to the point od drawing blood, numb toe pads on left foot only and twice left foot under sole up to my ankle went numb for over an hour.
I have urgency to go to the bathroom, both #1s & #2s, the runs and also periodic constipation. My iron is low and I am on iron supplaments for 3 months.
Thanks for reading, sorry it's long, any ideas would be appreciated :)
