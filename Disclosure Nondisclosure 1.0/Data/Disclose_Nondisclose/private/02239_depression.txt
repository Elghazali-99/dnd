Im 14 and I was adopted when I was 4, I went to hospital alot around december to get assesments or whatever done. I found out I have depression, social anxiety, post traumatic stress and attatchment disorder.
Recenetly tho.id say in the last 2/3 weeks things have been.hell.
Iv become even more self conciose and obsessed with how I look. I dont come down stairs now or let my family see me once I washed my makeup off, i refuse to go.out alot cause im scared of what I.look like.
I also am OBSESSED with me.weight. It started 600 calories a day and now 400. I feel scared of eating, and I feel guilt when I do. Iv also refused to go out because of this to, im terrified .
I hear this.man.in my head and I.know hes in my head but I cant shut him up. He makes me cry and feel bad, damands things too. He thretends and tells me ways I could end my life. He usually starts talking to me when.im around other people or in a social place like school, school.is hell D:
I got really low iron I.know but i feel more faint than ever, it feels like I half passout? Im not sure how else to discribe it. My vision goes black and im exhausted.
Im not trying to be attention seeking but its ruining my life and I just want someone to know how I really feel, and not feel judged
