At the age of 30, after a dramatic weight loss due to a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (50 lbs!) I started to experience SEVERE depression and anxiety for the first time in my lifea year ago. No history of emotional problems, nor is my life troubled. It's actually quite stable.
 I have spent this year exploring every medical possibility: B12, thyroid, neuro issues, heart issues, thiamine, and more. 
 I broke down and started bupropion 8 weeks ago, I am up to 300XL and have been for 6 weeks. I have felt a roller coaster of emotions, and during the 8 weeks maybe 5 days of feeling "good". My question is: is it possible I actually need more time to see results with bupropion?
 In your opinion, is a SSRI or serotogenic drug a better remedy for sudden clinical depression for a woman? I am in therapy, I also practice MMA and jog daily. My diet is superb, my sleep is fairly regular. I feel intense dread for no reason. I have considered starting birth control to stabilize my hormones, would this help since estrogen as stored in fat cells?
