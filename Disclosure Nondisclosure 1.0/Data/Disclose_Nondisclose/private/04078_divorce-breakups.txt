I would really like to no,the difference in who breaks the affair off,,i believe it matters,but would like to no opinoins of others,,when you find out and not told by your cheating partner,,who only stops the affair,,because the other person breaks it off not them,,and its only stopped cause decision times up and now your forced to choose,,and now your spouse is aware what you were doing,,,i was told by my husband he ended it,,i was told by the other she did,,i looked at the phone records and showed to me he called her after i found out 56 times,,she called him 2 times ,ya i no it looks bad,,my husband claims he was breaking it up slowly with her,,because he forseen trouble,,sometimes he is so convincing in his stories,,but he was also convincing what he was doing,when he was cheating,, in my deep of heart i feel she broke it off,,when i found out he says he broke it off 2 days prior ,,oh please that a bunch of **** for sure i no,,thy were still communicating after he ask me for forgiveness,,i think to me it makes a difference in my healing as to who breaks it off,,because if they wanted to be with them and they broke it off,,then im just his back up for all the security he had,,why not keep what you have if you get dummped,,,please opinion
