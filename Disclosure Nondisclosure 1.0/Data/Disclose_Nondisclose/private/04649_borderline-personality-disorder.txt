Hi, I urgently need some help. I can not control myself and can't cope with my self-destructive behaviour. I am afraid and just desperate watching how i slowly destroy what i've been creating for so long and with sooo much effort. Just because thats my next low period. And just because it's sooo habitual (nearly for 20 years, i am 24). I cant stand watching how i spoil relationships and attitude of surrounding people!...
I was diagnosed as borderline, but "recovering" borderIine. So generally i start to feel better, but sometimes... i do not want to live. i will never do suicide, but i silently ask god to take my life. thats how bad i feel at times. it's as if i am split apart, one part is good, and another just trying to crush me. and i cant stop it. i try to resist as much as i could and it takes immence amount of life energy to stay on the tightrope, i succeed most of the time, but eventually i fall. And its sooo hurtful that i dont care about my life... Its as if another part trying to prove that i AM worthless, if i am trying to live full life and pretend that i am "normal". Its as if this part punishes me for something. Maybe thats anger that i keep for the traumas in childhood done by my parents (mainly) is still sitting in me, and which i cant express. i cant project it onto my parents, because they love me too intensely and caused harm, because they did not know they would harm me by their behaviour and because they were traumatised themselves... obviously i cant project it to other surrounding people, so probably i do it onto myself, for being week, uncapable of coping with problem, for being not good enough, for performing poorly and blah blah blah... In several months (lol, so long, i hope i will be alive) ill start counselling, but now... I am afraid. I am seriously afraid, because do not know what to expect from this "bad" half. my life is ruining again. lol. ITS HORRIBLE to observe the evil inside you which u just cant stop...
How can I stop it?
