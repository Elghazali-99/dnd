I am 52- female. I have degenerative arthritis, 3 fractured and compressed vertebrae, 2 other fractured vertebrae, (wear complete back brace), TMJ, replaced right knee, shoulder surgery, radical hysterectomy, ( 1 year ago, not allowed to take hormones pesrcription or sipplements due to beast cancer), breast cancer survivor,(35 radiation treatments 2 years ago), thyroid cancer (unable to get rid of), since 1989 - 9 - I131 treatments, fybroidmyalgia, 3 fractures in right thumb recently repaired with tendon replacing joint and pin surgery, partial epilespy, clinical depression (fiance and friend of 8 years died 7 days before wedding 3 years ago), joint issues, chronic insomnia, broken left hand (10 years ago, pin surgery), neuropathy, high blood pressure, low iodine. 
NOW crepey skin.
WHAT can I do about the skin issue?
I drink 1 gallon of H2O a day, eat well, ride bike, walk, combat acupuncture, mediatation, caffeine only occasionaly - tea with honey, daily oranges and 1 apple, female mature complete vitamin, flax seed and fish oil, and of course many perscription medications for above issues. 
Skin issue started 6 months ago.
I am on SSDI, all doctors are at Veterans Hospital and are great and free. I am a vet of 13 years (left due to cancer).
I am barely making it financialy actually not really and I live minamaly and am in debt from heating bills etc - fortunately no credit cards or bills from them, or student loans (I was a psycothrepist).  
I can not really afford fancy surgery or moisturizers.
Anyone have any ideas about this, just arms and hands so far.
THANK YOU ANYONE!
