I wanted to tell you about the person I was before I meet my ex husband.....and why some of us need to look at that person for strength... My father died when my mum was pregnant with me and my twin brother. My mum killed herself on our first birthday....we lived in horrible foster homes until I was 11yr, then I was raped by a 33 yr old man when I went to my foster mother and she said get use to it that is what men do....I had to go to a friends house so her mum would take me to the hospital..they had to sew my virgina back together.....I ran away and lived in the streets...eating out of rubbish bins and showering in truck stops....I had my first child at 14 and we lived in a park, at 16 I found an appartment for my son and I and I went to school because I could not read or write....I was a very stong and independant woman and I made sure no one would ever hurt me....I met my ex husband at 19 and I was pregnant with my second child, he was from a weathly family and spoiled rotten....I realize now he was looking for a strong woman just like his mother....he left home and married me....I was the strong one for years....but slowly he soften my heart and it took years before I loved and trusted him..we lost a baby boy and had two more children...I broke my back 10 years ago and was in a wheel chair....but through determination I went to uni in my wheelchair and became a teacher and slowly taught myself to walk....my ex was very good support....there are things I still cant do like put shoes and socks on. and ride a bike....but I still worked full time and still did a lot of things......I have always been proud of my accomplishments....and then he gave me the Im not in love with you anymore, Iam sick of looking after you, and I want to be selfish and only think of myself......and of course sleep with a 22yr old neighbour......I lost all my strength over the years....and that is what I am going to find again.....that strength I had to survive the rape....the strength to go back to school.....the strength to walk again..... the strength to build a wonderful future for me and my children......please share your story...because sometimes people get strength from the whole journey I hope you enjoyed mine.......no matter how small or how long...please share......
