My husband and I have been together for a little over a year. During the first few months of our marriage I developed depression because we moved miles away from my hometown. I was living without a car, a job, friends, family, etc. I recieved treatment for my depression and my husband and I have returned to my hometown. I still go to counseling to continue to deal with anxiety issues but the depression has not returned.
   My husband at first was a very sensetive individual, and every since my depression he is very emotionally cut-off and my tears do not bother him. Every time we get in a fight now, he has angry outbursts says things to me like: f*uck you, you can't let a fight go because you have a f*ucking vagina, we're getting a divorce, you need to be fixed, it's all your fault, you're screwed up in the head, you're never going to get better, shut up etc. If i try to apologize he says i'm full of it, even though over the last few months I have improved greatly with my anxiety issues. He even has threatened his dad with things like, "you're lucky you're 60 old man or else.." If we are in the car and i accidentally hit a curb or something, he lectures me for over 30mins about how irresponsible I am and don't take care of my stuff.
 We have seen a marriage counselor once, but it seems that everything the guy said went in one ear and out the other. He didn't blame everything on my husband either.. he was very even about telling us our issues. I feel my husband needs his own form of counseling for anger management because i have enough of his verbal abuse. I'm worried one day it will turn more violent, he has already hit him self in the face and punched a table. I feel i am the only one trying to get better with MY emotional problems, and I may not be perfect yet, but he seems to believe I am the only one in this relationship who needs help. 
What can i do?
