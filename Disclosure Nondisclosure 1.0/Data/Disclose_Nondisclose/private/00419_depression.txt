Hi, I'm a 16 year old girl, and often in the mornings I felt unwell, which my mother decided was due to a hormone imbalance, so she gave me oil of evening primrose, which I took. About  week ago, I started to become very depressed - I have had mood swings before, and am prone to quite low lows, if that makes sense? However, it was much worse this time, and I had random crying fits, wanting to hide away, and very low self esteem. Sometimes I felt better again, but a simple, trivial comment fom my father like "no, cut the potatoes a bit bigger" would set me off again back into my depression, feeling like I was hopeless and couldn't cope, an could never achieve anything in my life.
I am not the sort of person who can really talk to my parents, i find it very difficult, as I do not get on very well with my mother a lot of the time, who just gets irritated if I am not my "normal, happy self" and struggle to expres my feelings even to my dad, who I am much closer to. [Both of my parents dismiss anything negative, such as concerns about my appearence, as "normal teenage stuff", but I feel I have it wose than I should.] 
Friends as well are out of the question, as I do not really have anyone I trust and who I feel cares about me enough to listen [another thing which worsenes my depression, and vice versa.] So, my question is, is this connected to the oil of evening primrose supplement or my menstual cycle in general? Stupid question I know, but I have never felt like this before, wanting to just disappear and wishing my life would just end [although i would not do that to my family]. 
I started to improve over the last couple of days, and today I got my period, which has been the worst it's ever been, with awful back pain and nausea; is this also connected, and does this mean anything?
 Apologies for the long post, and thank you to all who took the time to read it.
