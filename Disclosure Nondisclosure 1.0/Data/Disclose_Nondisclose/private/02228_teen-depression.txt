I would like to start off by saying that I am a 15 year old female sophomore . I make , or should I say "I've made", straight A's and I play on the basketball . Growing up , I lived with my grandparents and was also raised by them with the help of aunts and uncles . My grandfather died while I was at an early age , and after that it was just myself and my grandmother . My grandma was my best friend , my teacher , and also a mother . Two years ago my grandma became sick and unable to do for herself . I helped out as much as I could , but later on my biological mother moved in with us and helped her out . We did not get along at all . At the beginning of this year my grandma passed away . When she passed , I skipped days of school due to my grieving and preparation of her funeral . My grades started to drop and I was left to stay with my biological mother . As I said we didn't get along before my grandma died , so after it got worst . My mom always had a drug and alcohol problem . We began to argue a lot and I was put into my aunt's house to live temporary until my "mom" gets better . Around this time summer was starting . Last year around this time , I would have been on the beach , hanging out with my friends , going to amusement parks , and enjoying my life as a teenager . Everything is different now . My aunt doesn't let me go anywhere , so i don't have a social life . I basically don't have any friends anymore . Then i kinda realize that i never really had any . Everyday i just lay here and cry my eyes out . I feel as if my life has been taken from me and i don't want it back . If anyone can help me please do . Please no negative comments .
