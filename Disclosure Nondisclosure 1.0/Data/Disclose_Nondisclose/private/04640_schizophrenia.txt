I don't know what to do anymore. I love my boyfriend dearly, we have been together for 2 years now, and I don't want to break up with him. The story:
 In the past he has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and had several psychosis. However, this was in a time when he was smoking a lot of pot. After he stopped smoking so much, he didn't experience psychotic symptoms anymore (hearing voices, thinking there are camera's spying on him, thinking his family are poisoning his food etc.). So, he is not on medication. I should also say he is functioning good in terms of caring for himself, family and work (although he hardly has any friends).
 However, he is still showing behaviour that is a bit "strange" (very negative worldview, suspicious of other people, obsessed with aliens and the like) this however is not the problem for me. It's not always nice and sometimes embarrassing in company but it doesn’t immediately affect me. There is however a lot of behaviour that is affecting me. 
 He is extremely jealous and paranoid. Many times he accuses me of cheating (obvisouly I'm not). He can get extremely upset over (in my eyes) the smallest things. Me being a chaotic and not very structured person makes it worst. It would be ok if he expresses his suspicion in a normal, respectful way but he:
-curses
-assume things and accuses me (that I'm having sex with other people, that I don’t want him but actually want to be “free” etc.)
- is extremely angry and verbally violent (never physically)
- he is very manipulative and threatens me. If I don’t want to talk with him for some reason (for instance because I have other plans for the evening) he says he is going to have sex with someone else and won’t tell me.
- every other while he announces he doesn’t want to be with me anymore (mostly over a small thing), he then says I’m a bad and evil person and then he destroys all my pictures and removes everything that has to do with me out of his life. This is soooo hurtful.
 I should say he is smoking pot and drinking as well. However I cant get him to stop this, even though I tried to explain him it’s not good at all. He says it’s his life. The same goes for taking medicine. He thinks nothing is wrong with him.
 This all sounds very negative and if he wasn’t such a sweet, caring person I wouldn’t stay with him. But he is. And I love him very much that makes it so hard. Also, in his good periods, this behaviour doesn’t show, or in manageable ways.  
 My questions: Do you think he is SZ? Can anyone advice me how to deal with his threats of having sex with other women? We are in a long distance relationship. I am planning to live with him in the hope things will get better then. Do you think this will make things better?
 I know I have to be strong and ignore his negative behaviour (right? or shouldn’t I?)  but sometimes I can't and I end up doing things I really don't want to do, just to avoid the drama. I feel like I'm loosing myself right now. I have a problem with setting my boundaries in general, and in this case it’s even harder. I think he really doesn’t understand how much he hurts me every time.
 I love him but I don’t know how to deal with him. Please can anyone advice me.
