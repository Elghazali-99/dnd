Hi,
 My partner and me have been together for 4 years. The whole time he stuffs up on me and goes out or drinks ridiculously. Or leaves me randomly.
It's not that it's my relationship I'm concerned for because he can be great! Really great and it's not just for his benefit because he would be better off alone to get what he wants.
 But out of no where he will snap, where he runs me down. Leaves me randomly as soon as he gets home or snaps and just doesn't stop. He will laugh when I'm hurt, say every hurtful thing there is and than in an instance he can snap back to himself and be good again.
It can take hours or minutes of days.
 He's just told me recently he hears voices in his head. Voices that tell him to be bad. And this has been since before we were together. Before we were together the voice would tell him to be a f wit to other people. Put them down. Now it's more at me unless we break up than he does it to other people again.
He said the voice in the head taps and keeps tapping to come out. Sometimes he's got to tell it to go away sometimes it takes over and he doesn't even realise what he's doing sometimes it tells him he should f me over. He said sometimes he has conversations with it. And if he's in that mind he will be like this to anyone. Sometimes he can beat it sometimes he can't. Because when he's doing it and realises he hates it in the present, before and after it. Than sometimes he doesn't even know he's done it until after.
He won't have friends because of it. Sticks to himself but will have associates. It's really weird.
 It sounds really bad. But i don't see it as a relationship issue. I think it's him. He is a really healthy boy and is in his 20's and doesn't take drugs.
I don't know how to address it when he doesn't want to go to the doctor because he doesn't want it to be a issue.
