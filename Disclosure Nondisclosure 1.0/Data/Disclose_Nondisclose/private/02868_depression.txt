I was in an auto accident 15 years ago!  It ended my career and caused me to have two nervous breakdowns back to back.  The doctors had me on so much medication I did not know my name or anyone else.  After several years my memory started coming back.  I was able to find some sanity that I could grab ahold of and I began to take notice of meds that I was taking.  I began weaning myself off this and that.  I found a wonderful Christian family doctor that cared more for his patients than just giving a quick fix.  He has helped me thru this journey with withdrawals.  I am now down to 150mg of Venlafaxine.  However, every time I get lower than that I get very ill.  I don't feel like I'm depressed and I really want off this med.but I cannot get off of it.  The pain is overwhelming!  I feel as if my head will explode and the vertigo is awful. I still fall a lot and, of course, I get hurt but I need someone's help in getting off this med.   I'm afraid that if something happens to me and I cannot talk or communicate, I will suffer really bad because I can't tell them about the medicine....Venlafaxine!
