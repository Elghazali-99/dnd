So, my wife of 7 years just flipped a switch in her head and decided she doesn't want this anymore. She has quite a history of pushing her responsibilities off onto other people. Which has now come to a breaking point. She recently forced me into bankruptcy to save the house. She hadn't paid the mortgage in several months and didn't tell me anything about it until we were being foreclosed on. Now I'm paying the mortgage as well as over $30,000 of her debt is being garnished from my paycheck for the next 5 years and suddenly she wants out! She can't afford to move ouut. She can't afford a divorce lawyer and neither can I. So she moved herself into the spare bedroom and is. Living here as a stranger. Coming and going at all hours, getting all dolled up and going who knows where acting like she's single while I'm stuck here worrying how I'm going to pay the bills. Would it be legal or ethical to charge her rent? She has the ability to make more money. She owns a small business. She could stay open longer or for more than 5 days a week. She could try harder. But only puts slightly more effort into this business than she put into our marriage.
