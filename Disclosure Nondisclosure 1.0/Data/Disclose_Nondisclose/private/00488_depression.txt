I made a post a few months back saying I believed I had depression, and I was told I was just not eating enough (which I wasn't). I began eating regularly and I still feel like I have depression. Summer started for me two weeks ago, and I have been avoiding everything. My friends have been asking me to hang out and I just don't feel like I want to go out, and if I say yes, I eventually cancel the plans because of unknown reason. My motivation has really gone done, I'm currently a young "artist" who draws digitally, but lately I haven them able to finish projects, or I just feel so insecure of the so far progress of it that I just close out of my art program to never see the partially finished piece again. And today (and for the past few days actually) I've spent over 15 minutes crying because I'm just completely sick of myself. I've been thinking horrible things in my head on how to change myself, or how to please others who complain about things I do. I've been so touchy with my emotions lately, so the littlest insults or anything really can push my over the ledge and make me over analyze it into something about how horrible of a person I am. I really just want to know if I have depression or any other things going on with me before I speak up about it to my mom. Please, and thank you.
