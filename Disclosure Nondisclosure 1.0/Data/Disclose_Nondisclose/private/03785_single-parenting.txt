Hi,
 We're happy to introduce our newest feature - Health Pages. Health Pages are public documents on health topics created in collaboration by MedHelp users. So much more than a dictionary, they can be a compilation of FAQs, a listing of relevant articles and news, a summary of recent research, or any other information that members of the community might find useful.
 Health Pages were designed to be a collaborative effort to share information, so any user in the community can contribute by editing a Health Page.
 Here are a few examples of Health Pages already created:
 * Why could I be dizzy: http://www.medhelp.org/health_pages/Ear+Nose+and+Throat/Why-could-I-be-dizzy/show/12?cid=59
 * Common Pregnancy Acronyms: http://www.medhelp.org/health_pages/Pregnancy/Common-Pregnancy-Related-Acronyms/show/1?cid=77  * MS Information: http://www.medhelp.org/health_pages/Multiple+Sclerosis/MS-Information-and-Resources-Index/show/22?cid=36
 All of these Health Pages can be edited and built upon. To view or create Health Pages in your community, just click on the "Health Pages" link in the top right hand corner of the community below the "Discussions" link. 
 This is a brand new feature that we're very excited about here, so please let us know what you think. Your feedback will be critical in helping future updates and enhancements.
