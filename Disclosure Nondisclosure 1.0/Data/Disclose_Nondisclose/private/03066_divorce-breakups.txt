I recently have been married for 2 years and things keep getting worse every day.  I met my wife on a christian dating website 4 years ago.  I was at a point where I decided to give my life to God and my wife had already been a christian for over 14 years.  As things started getting a little more serious she decides to tell me about all her sexual partners and i do not feel comfortable with this so I tell her 10 which was actually about 16.  She was ok with 10 but later in relationship I told her truth.  It devastated her so much she broke up with me.  We later got back together but because she broke up with me i decided not to tell her I went to Disney World with my first girlfriend twice.  This was not told to her until we got married bc she would constantly tell me I know you are still lying about something.  One day I decided to tell her the full truth and now she is devastated by these trips and feels I threw everything away before marriage.    It bothers her so much she goes to bed at 6am bc she cant let it go.  As you can see I had no structure growing up in divorce household with not best influences from my brothers.  She grew up in a good structure.  I am a completely changed man, I have a good career where my wife doesnt have to work and I am constantly trying to make up for my past.  I regret all of those mistakes and regret not living a more pure life.  No matter what I do though,  she always says she feels low bc of my past.  I try and take these things to God but it seems things are getting worse as this marriage continues.  Ive offered even to see a counselor but she does not want to.  Do you think there is something I am not doing right or is she never going to be able to let this go?
