For some reason, I can't seem to tolerate AD meds.
 I've tried Paxil, Effexor, Wellbutrin, Celexa and others, but always seem to suffer with some pretty bad side effects on all of them.
 With the Paxil, I had insomnia, really bad night sweats and GI problems.
 With the Effexor, I had really bad insomnia, heart palpitations and anxiety.
 With the Wellbutrin, I actually got more depressed and even had a "road rage" incident while on it.
 And the Celexa reacted badly with my blood pressure meds causing on-going PVC attacks and bouts of a-fib.
 So, I've pretty much given up on them at this point.
 The doctor also gave me Xanax (PRN), but I have been taking one (1) tablet on a daily basis, and it seems to be helping more than the previously mentioned meds without the side effects (other than some really weird dreams).
 The only issue is that my doctor calls Xanax a "high", and doesn't believe it should be taken daily.
 However, it has been working for me, so when I go to him this Friday for a follow up on the Paxil, I am going to tell him that I want to be put on Xanax as a daily dose and that I really don't want to be put on the AD meds anymore.
