I had a session with my psych therapist yesterday.  We talked about the same things we always do but also about my health problems including pain in legs, arms, side of face, mouth and even my teeth, and I've seen different doctors including my PCP, ENT, rheumatologist for pain in legs and arms, hematologist because my PCP found I had a very high platelet count.  I went to the ENT on my own because of my mouth hurting and my throat and I could not swallow solids, the other doctors I was referred to by ENT or PCP.  During all of my therapy sessions, I always speak of wanting to die, not suicide, just the wish to die.  Therapist asked why I want to die but yet I go to doctors to feel better.  I said I just don't want to hurt with the pain that everything is causing.  Now I see my psych nurse practitoner next week, would you tell her about this statement from my therapist?  Maybe I'm being too sensitive and I took her statement as a choice, either wish to die or doctors.  I haven't made my next therapy session appt. yet, not sure I will either.  Not sure if I should discuss this with my NP or not.  My thought is to stop going to doctors, get used to the pain, and I think I can, because I don't believe I'll ever get the thought of dying out of my mind completely even with all the therapy, as every time something doesn't go right, I have a problem with something, my first thought is that I wish I would just die.
