Ok so I'm super scared right now I'm 21 and about 2 weeks ago I noticed this spot on my back (I get pimples all over my back all the time) and I was already freaking out about melanoma because I have a mole on my toe. But I saw this small pinkish bump on my back and I scratched it and made it swelled a bit it was also slighty painful like a pimple when I went to my doctor she looked at it and said it looked like acne and I have a few light pink pimples next to it. She gave me acne cream and I started it twice a day for 4-5 days the swelling from my scratching it went down and stopped just because I forgot to take it. I just started about 3-4 days ago with the cream and my bump is still there!! it's like a pinkish brown in color and very small and just slightly raised I mean it's the size of a pin head. It could be going down I'm not for sure but I'm really scared it could be Nodular melanoma!!  :(  I don't want to run to the doctor unless it really could be. I mean theres no growing etc from it. But I read Nodular melanoma does not grow on the outside. Can someone HELP!! Btw my cream says it can take 3-8 weeks to work.
