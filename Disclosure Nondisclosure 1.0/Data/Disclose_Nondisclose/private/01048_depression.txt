Hi im 27 years old female who has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD and i feel as though i have some sort of A motivational disorder but have not been to see a physiologist in about two yeats. My life seems so unrealistic to even me and i feel very detached from reality in some ways. I am aware of everything that has or is happening around me but its almost like my thought process skips over most normal emotions this only started about a year and a half ago when i lost my little brother to suicide then less than two months later was here at my home with my first husband when he threatened to shoot me then shot himself after two hours of me pleeding with him to calm down. When my brother died i became very emotionally distressed then when o lost my husband it lasted about two months... i still feel i am depressed over my loss but even when speaking about this to others its like i seperate myself from reality like im telling about something that happened to someone else. I also have been through alot of other things like my mom being murdered by her husband when i was 8 a drug addict father who i met and moved in with when i was ten who beat and raped me for four years before the state took me from him and then i was from foster home to group home and so on untill i turned 18 i have been in very physically and mentally abusive relationships i dont use drugs including pills prescribed or not no not even aspirin but i do use marijuana to try to take the edge off my depression and anxiety but latley i have been feeling desperately alone even though since i lost my first husband i remarried i just dont feel i can emotionally connect with anyone and now im pregnate with my third child and am afraid i wont be able to bound with this child as i have found i have unintentionally. Spaced myself from my other two children and it only deepens my depression because its not fair to any of them. I feel i cant handle the reality of everything that has happenedso im shutting down. What can i do wwhen i cant even convince myself to go see someone about this because i feel lie it has never helped in the past
