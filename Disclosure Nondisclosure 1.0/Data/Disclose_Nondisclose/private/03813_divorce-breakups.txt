First: I am considering breaking up with my boyfriend, but I can't bear to leave our cat behind. He has been abusive to our cat and to me, and I just can't bear the thought of leaving Felix (the cat) here. However, I purchased Felix a gift for my boyfriend last may, and I think he would pursue me to the ends of the earth if I take Felix with me- he could come after me legally too, since he has a lawyer in the family. I purchased Felix from the breeder, I pay all of his vet bills, food, necessities, etc. and his microchip and breeder registration are registered to me. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do? I know technically Felix was a gift, but if I am financially responsible can they still come after me? I know his friends and family will all vouch that Felix was a gift, and none of them know what my boyfriend has done. They think all of the vet visits were because of "accidents" that the cat got into, not because my boyfriend was being too rough on Felix.  I'm also concerned because my boyfriend knows where all of my family members live, and has enough money that he could show up wherever I stay.
 Second: Am I a horrible person if I just up and leave without saying anything? I feel like a horrible horrible person, like it's not the mature thing to do to "steal away in the night" so to speak, but I'm scared of him. He's never hit me, but he's thrown me around and wrapped his hands around my throat on several occasions. It's still so hard for me to accept that the person I love more than anything can do these things to me, but I know in my heart I can't stay with someone that treats me like this. It's like there's just something stopping me from leaving, like I would be a quitter and I'd be letting him down if I do.
