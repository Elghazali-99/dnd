Ok so idk where to begin so Im just gonna say it all because I think there might be more then one thing wrong with me. 
So lets start off with me hating myself I feel like im a bad person I always felt like I was gonna go to hell even when I was little like 4 or 5. Also I feel like I do good things just to make me feel better. And I also have these terrible thoughts about wanting to kill someone or how it would feel to kill someone and to be known as a killer. 
Ok another thing that's wrong with me is I dropped out of school because it was just to many people like at lunchtime it would be too much noise for me and I would start breathing hard like I couldn't handle it. I also dropped out because I dont like being around people I feel like they're staring at me. I really dont go anywhere now I just stay home I feel like home is the only place I wanna be or can be. I dont have any friends and I stopped caring about things like my appearance or school I just dont care anymore. I also have a very low self esteem I hate looking in the mirror im disgusted by what I see and I dont want anyone else to see me. Also its hard for me to talk to people it was hard before but now its worse its like when I try to talk or respond back to someone I cant get the words out and when I do it doesnt make any sense. Ive been forgetting things and been having trouble remembering things when I try it hurts. Last I have been very tired and just want to sleep but when I do sleep I cant stay asleep or I have trouble falling asleep? Idk whats going but can someone help me?
