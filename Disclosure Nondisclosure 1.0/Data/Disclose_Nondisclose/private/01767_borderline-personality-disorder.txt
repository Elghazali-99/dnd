Im 30 yrs old living with bpd im not quite sure how i became this way but i was diagnosed a few years back when i started cutting on myself... never even new that there was such a thing but it all seems to make sense as to why i did some of the things i did growing up..im the type that def sees things in black or white and i label ppl as being good or bad.. there is no inbetween ..i use to be very permiscuous growing up always trying to find somthing in that person but was never satisfied emotionally, mentally, or sexually.. i would have to say im the type of person that def needs alot of attention...i have found someone who completes me in everyway someone who i want to spend the rest of my life with but i fear that this damn disorder will push her away i know the way i am and i know that i wouldnt even be able to put up with myself so i give her credit for loving me the way that she does..sometimes i tend to push her away because im in fear that she will find someone better ...i accuse her of stuff when i know it isnt true but it just comes out of my mouth ..i get angry quickly i fear myself that i could one day snap and do somthing to hurt myself or her..i dont quite know if im getting better or worse i feel i have accomplished some things such as when i feel like i wanna hurt myself (wich hasnt been that often like before) i tend to distract myself and quickly shift and get into doing somthing else to take away the urge.. and i have been faithful to her since we have been together wich was something i could never do in a relationship..lately thoe i have been real forgetful it has gotten so bad that im finding i need to write everything down otherwise i will forget does anyone else have this problem? okay well i guess thats enough writing for now...
