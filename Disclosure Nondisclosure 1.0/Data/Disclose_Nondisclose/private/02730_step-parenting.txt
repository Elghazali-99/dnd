Married with two kids a 18 yr son and 13 yr daughter. Son gets disrespectful to his mother and sister by cussing, talking to them any kind of way. He moved in maybe a year and half ago from grandparents house. The grandparents raised him majority of his life. I feel they baby and spoiled him. He is spoiled and thinks we suppose to conform to how his grandparents treat him. Nawh...In the beginning of the marriage i didn't agree with him living with my wife parents. I fought this decision that my wife made. She is the type of person that trys to make her parents happy, like her, and afraid to put her foot down. 
During the holiday of thanksgiving  he got real disrespectful and we was all at the grandparents house. So i tried to check him and guess what? My wife and others wanted me to calm down from whooping his a... I told that mf to meet me outside, i got tired of it. Keep in mind his mouth been running for awhile for months. I speak and discuss with my wife on this matter but she all about tryna talk him down. To me thats all anybody ever do is talk and never act or perform discipline. Talk...talk...talk!!!! He know that is all they gonna do is talk. Thats why he the way he is. I didn't grow up like that. So after the holiday past, my little family ...the 4 of us. Wife, stepson, daughter, and me. Unpacked....time passes by for that day. He was on the back porch, so i went out there to talk and find out what his problem is. Ask him why he talk to his momma and sister like they some h,os on the street. Im standing he sitting. I said if i ever hear u talk to them or anybody like that ever again yo feelings gonna get hurt. He making gesture like whatever and this dude stood up got in my face. I said dont do this. Not what u want. It was over!!! I dived on him. My wife came out there to break it up. I told him he gotta go, right now. He talking mess and my wife cousin was there(female) she holding me back. Im talking mess. GET OUT NOW before i dive again. He left....guess what? After 24hrs he back in the house. Not my decision. I was mad. Keep in mind he about to be 19 on the 10th of this month. My wife uncle is a pastor and he told she needs to step up. If she allow him back in some rules need to be made for him. If he cant follow them he needs to go. She cant do nothing  and sit on it thinking that is gonna heal it. So what y'all think.
