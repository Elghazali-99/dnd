Im 15, and i think i might be majorly depressed. My step raped me for 4 years, and ever since that happened, i havent been the same. i finally "grew some balls" and told the police about my step dad, he's been in jail for 8 months now and i still to this day have horrible nightmares about him..... then i found out my best friend in the whole entire world was getting raped by her biological dad for about as long as i was by my step dad, and i convinced her to tell the cops on him about a month and a half ago...... my nightmares have big time worsened... and that best friend had to move away.... she moved to a whole other state :( ive been litterally having mental break downs since she left....... she was the only on holding me together..... now i barely get to talk to her... i havent gone to school in 2 weeks cuz im soo torn apart by this whole thing......... i cry like a million times a day, only leave my room to use the restroom and get food, and to get the phone to call her..... ive been wanting to cut again sooo bad.... but everytime i even think about cutting or killing my self, i think of her... im an emotional wreck without her........ I DONT KNO WHAT TO DO!!!!!! SOMEONE HELP ME!!!!!!
