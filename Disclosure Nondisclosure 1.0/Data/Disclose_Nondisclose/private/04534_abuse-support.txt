My brother in law has been mentally and possibly physically abusing my neice and nephews and sister for 10 years.  I believe that he is a sociopath.  He has no remorse for anything he does or says and my sister just constantly is at his defense.  She sees it, but she is looking at him like a paycheck.  She doesn't work very much and he wont let her work anywhere else to supplement her income.  He is very controlling, doesn't control his swearing ever.  He is very concerned with power.  The other day, we ( my mom, and two sisters and I) were having a pretty truthful conversation about her husband and she did not like to hear the truth, she got upset and didnt want to hear any of it, so I got very very upset because i cannot stand to see her choose her psycotic husband over my niece and nephews any longer , i ended up hitting her.  I am not justifiying this, it was wrong.  I just want to know if her husband can file charges against me for hitting his wife?  Can he have me arrested for this?  I want to file a restraing order against him to protect my family as he sent a very nasty email to the whole family, but I do not want to get arrested.  I also want to call DSS but not sure if this would have reprecussions either on my family.  I know he would know it was me! This has never happened in my family until this idiot came into it!  If someone knows this answer, please let me know
