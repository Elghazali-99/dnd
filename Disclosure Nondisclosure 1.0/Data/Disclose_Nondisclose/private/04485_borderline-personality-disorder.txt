I have been diagnosed with a quite a few disorders - BPD, GAD, Major Depression, Dysthymia and PTSD - I suffered terrible abuse as a child and was officially diagnosed with all of the above over 20 years ago.  The professionals that I see talk to me about becoming a functioning healthy 'normal' person and being out there living life.  Thing is I can't really see it.,...I mean I can't say I have ever been anythng other than what I am....medications haven't worked and I feel like I can't do it on my own - especially since I've never experienced what they are talking about what I can have - I have no real support system other than my pysch and case manager - my mother is absolutely no help what so ever and I don't really have anyone else in my life anymore - I also am dealing with a drug problem and I am trying so hard but for some reason keep coming back....I mean I really would like to die and leave all this....but if I were to know for certain that I will become well then hopefully I can wait it out - but not for years and years.....does anyone have any suggestions, thoughts, personal insight that they would not mind sharing with me, I am feeling so very desperate
