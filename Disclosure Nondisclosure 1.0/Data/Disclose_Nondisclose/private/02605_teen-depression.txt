Just over a month ago I started seeing a coucilor at my school because my youth pastor contacted them when I told her about my attempts to end it all. 
 Anyways so last week the councilor had me fill out a couple qestionares and she graded them today and told me I grade for severe depression. And that she thinks I should start seeing a psychiatrist but I can't because my Mum doesn't know about all this and she's not going to. My councilor knows this so I was wondering what can I do to get better??? So far I have been writting poems to brighten my mood and prevent myself from attempting. Also I'm not attempting anymore because I I promised God I'm going to try hardest bit to attempt anymore and I've decided trying my hardest not to attempt is not attempting at all. 
 But again I find myself thinking of ending it everyday. I'm not going to act on it but I still want to. 
I find myself cravingthe plastic bag. The warmth of it. I find myself thinking if I give in to the welcoming warmth of the bag everything will be calm and that I'll fall in a calm permanent sleep. 
But I can't attempt anymore but again the thought are coming everyday. What can I do??? I find myself getting more and more down! And my self esteem is getting lower and lower everyday.
