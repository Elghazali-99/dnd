I've been married to the same man for over 18 years. We just had our 3rd and last child (a baby boy). He works hard and spends some of his time with our kids, but I feel as though he is emotionally neglectful/abusive to me. He does not support my goals (going back to school to finish my college degree for example). We married very young and I realized some time ago that we have grown to become different people than we were at the beginning of our marriage. 
 Will things ever get better? I know that I cannot change him, but lately I have been wondering if it's worth hanging around for another 18 years or not. I know that I could probably do better than this, but I was molested as a child and have a deep distrust for men in general. Also, I know that this sounds super paranoid, but I worry that another man might abuse my children, so I stay with their father - and take the emotional neglect instead. What do you think?
 My sister (who was not abused) believes that I married beneath me and should get out before I waste the best years of my life with hubby... I am not happy in the marriage, but honestly, this is all that I have ever known marriage-wise. I love my kids, they are my entire world, I just want to do what is best for them.
 BTW, I have gotten professional counseling and have worked through some of the abuse (I no longer blame myself for what happened) but I can't shake the paranoia.
