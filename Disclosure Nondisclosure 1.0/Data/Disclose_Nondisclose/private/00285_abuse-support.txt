Hello, my name is Stephanie. I am now seventeen years old. I don't like my home life. At all. My parents are divorced and I live with my mother. My mother is a mean and cruel woman. I don't understand what I've done to make her not like me so much. She's hated me since I was a child, she even tells me. She's hit, beat, punched, scratched, shoved, kicked, and spit on me before. I'm so mental scarred from it now. The beatings aren't often anymore, because I've threatened to kill her. Instead now, she knows I won't fight back so she fights with me, picks on me, calls me names, shoves me, and tries to start fights with me. She's so mean to me. She likes to say that me getting raped was all my fault... And that really hurts my feelings. She will try anything to hurt me in some way. I can stand there and cry and she will just look at me with no emotion. I ask for a hug and she says get away from me. I just don't get it. I'm doing good in school, I'm not in trouble with the law, I don't drink, do drugs, or smoke, I obey the rules, I'm off medication and trying to do well in therapy... What am I doing wrong? She sees no difference in me and that makes me feel worthless and no good :(
Now, I really want to live with my father but he's not really great either. She has full custody of my brother and I. How can I convince her to let me go live with him? What should I do? I hate it here and I can't really take anymore bullcrap. I feel like I'm going to snap and just go crazy. Are all parents mean? Are all parents like this? :'( How can I get her to care about me? How can I leave?
