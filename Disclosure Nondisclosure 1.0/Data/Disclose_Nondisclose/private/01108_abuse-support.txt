Recently we had my husband's brother and his pregnant girlfriend come and live with us briefly while they were looking for a place to live. His brother's girlfriend also has a 10 yr old daughter who was also staying with us. Her daughter would follow me around and want to help me with cooking and cleaning and one day she began telling me how much she hated my husband's brother. She also told me that one night when he went into to say goodnight to her he asked her if she wanted him to show her how to kiss properly! i asked what happened next and did she talk to her Mum about it and she said she told him to get lost and he left the room. The next day she told her Mum about it and when she confronted him about it he said she was lying and he asked her if she wanted him to show her how to skate properly. Her Mum did not believe her. This absolutely devastated me and I believe her. It is so sad that she has gone to her own mother about this and she won't believe her. It breaks my heart. I spoke to my husband about it that night who told me that a while ago he found a child pornographic picture saved in his brothers computer and that child porn websites kept popping up. I Have a 2 year old daughter and do not want anything to do with my husbands brother anymore because I am not willing to risk my daughter's safety. I also am worried that maybe this type of thing can run in the family. I know it is a horrible thing to worry whether your own husband may be capable of doing something like this but what do you think? Should I be worried?
