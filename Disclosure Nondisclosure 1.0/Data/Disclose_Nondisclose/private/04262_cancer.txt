I have recently come across a small lump in the right side of my neck located just past the halfway point of my neck and slightly towards the back (behind my ear as opposed to in front of it). The lump is not painful, hard, and I can move it slightly up and down, and it's not round more of and oval shape. I don't smoke or drink, I am however tired all the time. 
 At my last physical a year ago I told my doctor about how tired I was all time and after some blood work I was advised that my iron was at a dangerously low level and by B12 was extremely low as well. I should also mention that she could not figure why my iron was so (not that she tried, no further tests were taken). A year later, I am still tired all the time and now I have this lump in my neck. Cancer is also quite prevalent in my family, my aunt is now just recovering from Lymphoma and my uncle bladder cancer. My mother has also advised me that my grandmother was anemic...
 Should I just keep an eye on this lump to see if it changes, or goes away. Any thoughts???
