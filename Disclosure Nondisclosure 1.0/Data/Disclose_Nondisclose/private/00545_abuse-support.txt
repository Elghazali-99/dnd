Hi guys, I'm releatively new to this forum, and I came across it in an effort to "try" to resolve some terrible issues in my life.--I'm sure this will be somewhat long, but I want to give you a good idea of what's tearing at me.---I am a 43 yr old F, that has had a relatively rough life/time.---I was adopted at 7 by a family that I "thought" would want/love/desire me.--As I grew up, I realized that that was not the case, and I guesss you can say, I never bonded with them.--I always felt like a 3rd Wheel.---I grew up, had 2 girls and ALWAYS tried to do the best I could.--Each challenge was a struggle.  Back in 91 my "father" had passed away, and my "mother" had asked me to move up next to her in the "spare" house they had.--I did, to save on rent, be next to her, just whatever.----Over the years, quite often I ran into financial hardships being a single mothre w/2 kids, paying bills,groceries, etc....And over the years my mother has helped me out with that as she financially could (money was not a problem or issue when I was growing up, and even now)(for my mother).--So, each time I ran into an "issue" she would "offer" to help, and I let her help.----Well, onto the hardest part and latest thing that is just ripping me a part is, approximately 3-4 months ago I was dx'd with MS. A TRUE SHOCK AND SCARY CONCEPT FOR ME.(As it's gonna be ME that this disease will eat up and spit out).-- From the absolute beginning she has REFUSED to acknowledge that Yes, I have MS, and that in the short time of Dx, it's eaten/taken ALOT away from what used to be me.(Steady walking, cognigtive issues, just whatever)--(the Dr's figured I've had it about 15-20 yrs, so it's almost reaching it's max now),  she just will not beleive that I have MS.---Recently I lost my job due to doing something really stupid at work, and since then things with my mother have gotten TERRIBLE AND OUT OF PROPORTION.---After she found out I was laid off, she has turned ABSOLUTELY COLD AND DISREGARDING. Now, my mother and I have not always been very close, as I said I never really bonded with her growing up and she kinda made it clear to me that she never bonded with me.She really was'nt ever a very loving mother, growing up.---But, after losing my job, she has gone to be just terrible with me.---She knows I was struggling financially before losing my job, and since all this happened she has told me that she regrets EVER adopting me because I've been such a screw up to her over the years, (a disgrace in her eyes), tells me that how me having MS messes up "her life"(Oh really, what about my life!!!) and I'm a disgrace for "getting" MS! (She must think ya catch MS at the local damn grocery store or something!!!!), she has told me that she DOES NOT care what happens to me, and does not want me in the house next to her, as I am nothing but a failure/disgrace/ and I ruin her image in the community (which has been HUGE to her over the years)---always saying "What will the neighbors think?---She knows I was struggling with the utilities---getting meds or whatever, and now that I'm unemployed it's 100x's harder/worse.----And she has screamed at me that she will not help or bail me out anymore.---She told me that she does not care whether the utilities get shut off and I freeze or whatever.--She does'nt care if I have food or not.--And said she could give a **** if I have my meds or not.--Basically she has said---she could care less if I end up on the streets. This is also a woman that threw the Xmas presents I managed to get her, --back at me and said I don't want anything from you.Take em back and get your money back.----I told her I NEED my meds and that I don't have the money for the co-pay's, I have'nt gotten groceries since Thanksgiving, just really in a bind.--Obviously I am not gonna be able to maintain the utilities here, and it's a matter of time before they get shut off.----In talking with people at Public Assistance, tehy said due to the huge amount of people applying lately, it'll be about 3-4 weeks before I get anything.-----I guess what is just tearing me up is HOW--WHY???----How and why would a so-called mother NOT want to offer any help to her daughter!!!How is it and why would she care less if I can't walk due to Ms, and say I don't care if you end up on the streets.--How do you say, You think I'm a disgrace, and that you regret adopting me!!--How you could careless if I have anything to eat.---Just basically that she cares about me as much as you would the trash along the curb!!---Yet, this is a woman that is very active in the community, almost "perfect" in the eyes of the community, that has more money then she knows what to do with, always worries what everyone else will think, but could give a rat's furry a*# about her "daughter" with a debilitating disease, could care less if she is homeless, whatever.--Talk about what the neighbors will think?!  What will they think when they realize she's done that to her own family!----How could a mother do that to a daughter???---I guess I just don't comprehend that.----I want to tell her--to have her see--that I am NOT a screw up cuz I have MS, I'm NOT a disgrace, I'm NOT a lousy person/peice of ****!!---I may have screwed up over the years (as we all do), that I may have turned to her to help me out when I was behind the 8-ball (she would offer to help out, so I would accept)---but that how in God's name can you allow someone you "claim" as a daughter to go without food, MUCH NEEDED MEDS, heat, shelter, whatever!!--I TRULY need to get my MS meds refilled as I don't have the money for the co-pays, so I have;nt been able to get them and BOY OH BOY is my body paying for it,  The pain is "unique" to say the least. 2 of the meds I need are for helping me to walk better, and not have leg spasms that prevent you from standing/walking, whatever.--1 med is for my heart, and 2 other one's are to "assist" the other meds for pain.--Cuz I'll tell ya this---MS IS A VERY PAINFUL DISEASE! ---It's like I want to say to her,  OK, I understand not helping with the heat and all, (I guess), but how and why in God's name would you let me go without food or meds!! And tell me you want me out of my house and don't care where I end up.---So, guys, I'm hoping ANYONE of you guys can give me an insight as to why she's being this way---or what I could try to do.-----I just can't beleive all this.---How she can be so cruel/heartless, whatever.--Thinking and telling me I'm a disgrace--a screw up, just whatever.----So, if ya can guys, give me an insight----something that'll make me feel a "tad" better inside.---And NOT WANT TO END IT ALL!!---Anything to just end the pain----from her.  So I'm looking forward to your help.---THANKS
