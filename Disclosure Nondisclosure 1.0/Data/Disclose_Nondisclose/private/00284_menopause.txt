Hi. I am 50 and went off the pill about 2 years ago, after having been on it many years with very light periods. Since then my periods have been horrible, often heavy, with diarrhea at times and bad cramps and clotting. Mostly they are regular. One month last year I skipped, only to get it twice the next month. I do not get hot flashes, but I do get moody (this seems to have gotten a bit better lately thank God). The thing is this month I got my period and wasn't due to get it again for another week or more. Last Friday night I got a little light blood and figured my period was coming on again. The next day no blood but very tired. Sunday not too bad. But at work on Tuesday mid day I got cramps and they haven't stopped (today is Wed) and I'm home sick. There's no blood but I am very tired, jittery and moderate to bad cramps. I've been taking 3 ibuprofen but they don't help much. Is this normal for peri-menopause or menopause? Both my older sisters had hysterectomy's so they can't really give me any input.  Thank you very much! Gayle
