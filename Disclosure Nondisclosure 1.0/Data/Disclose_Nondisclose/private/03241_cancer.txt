I'm 18 years old, female. I've had a persistent low-grade fever between 99-100 for nearly two months now. I've had other symptoms on and off as well that had been bothering me for a month or two before I sought help from my doctor. Among these have been --
 - fatigue/feeling generally run down 
- dull, deep aches in my shinbones and forearms 
- some joint, middle back, and knee pain 
- cold, clammy feet 
- aches on one side of my head (but not real headaches, just a throbbing ache that can come and go at random)
- occasional high pulse and shortness of breath (the past few times I've been to the doctor this month, my pulse is usually in the high 90's or low 100's, even when I feel very relaxed)
 I've had other symptoms too, such as some bouts of blurred/double vision, this strange pain running down both sides of my neck (which has occurred about a dozen times these past few months), middle back and rib aches. A lot of these are so up and down however, I don't consider them as one of the primary, persistent symptoms. Even among the symptoms above, none of them are really 100% persistent except the fever and feeling run down. Certain things like the head pains and joint pains seem to have improved lately, but that's happened before and it usually comes back. My doctor told me to keep a symptom log, and I've noticed patterns in what seems to be the most common complaint over time (the shin aches and forearm aches), even though the way I feel varies day to day. Looking back at my log, a lot of the complaints of where my forearm hurts and where my head hurts tend to occur on the left side. I don't know if that means anything.  
 I recently had a CBC. Although some things are a little on the high side, everything is about normal except for a slightly elevated CRP. The first time I took a CBC almost two months ago, my albumin protein was also slightly elevated (but only just above the line). I also have a very low positive ANA factor, but that's about it. I can't really read the other things. I tested negative for things like Epstein Barr, and have a negative rheumatoid arthritis factor. 
 My doctor referred me to the cardiologist (also for a slight murmur) and he said my heart is completely fine. I had a urine test come back with some bacteria in it, but I'm thinking it may have just been accidentally contaminated, considering I have no symptoms whatsoever of a UTI (my urine habits are completely normal, no pain, no burning or pressure, etc.). I just saw a rheumatologist a few days ago, but he was a blank canvas. He just looked me over and didn't answer any of my questions. I had a blood culture done, which was negative. The lymph nodes in my neck and armpits seem to be fine. The rheumatologist sent me for more blood work a few days ago, but I don't know what tests were done or what my results are. 
 Basically, I'm worried something a little more insidious is at work here. I've always had a habit of brushing things off because I don't like to make a big deal out of nothing, but I can't help but feel like this can't just be in my head. I'm starting to get worn out keeping up with all of this. I feel tempted to just let sleeping dogs lie and quit going to the doctor, see if my problems resolve themselves. I try to convince myself into thinking I've been improving, even though the fever is still present. I've felt very suspended these past two months. 
 There's no history of cancer in my family, other than my grandfather who had both prostate cancer and lymphoma. I think if there was anything seriously wrong with me it would have been found immediately, but I can't help but wonder. What could this be? Is it possible I have something else wrong with me like lupus, even without the characteristic rashes and sun sensitivity? Or is this just a run of the mill infection.  
 Thanks so much. I'm starting to get very confused here.
