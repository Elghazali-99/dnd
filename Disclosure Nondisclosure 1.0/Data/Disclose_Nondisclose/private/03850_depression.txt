The storm's rolling in, it's after my soul 
My brain switches off, I'm losing control 
The wind's picking up, my roof is now gone 
The storm's getting stronger, I try to hold on 
An invisible foe ties a new anchor 
I can't run away, my life is in danger 
How do you fight what you cannot see 
This fatal deppresion deep inside me 
My walls are crumbling, I thought they were stronger 
I close my eyes, I can take this no longer 
My clothes are ripped from me, I cling to my soul 
It's all I have left, I'm losing control 
I'm fat and I'm dumb, I'm fragile and scared 
I can't concentrate, this life isn't fair 
My opinions don't matter, I'm losing my will 
It's time to escape by taking a pill 
The addict takes over, he copes with the rain 
He helps me escape by numbing the pain 
The ground falls beneath me, I begin to fall fast 
My gift is a curse, how long can this last 
This cycle's not new, I've done this before 
I pray for a cure, bipolar no more 
An inevitable endingto a bittersweet life 
The blood's gonna drip from the edge of this knife 
Admitting I'm powerless I go to the Brook 
The answers are hidden in this simple notebook 
My life's in danger please give me the tools 
I'll attend all the groups and follow the rules 
I emerge from the hole, the sun's shining bright 
I open my eyes and I'm through with the fight 
Through all my hard work my brain switches on 
The mania returns and the darkness is gone
