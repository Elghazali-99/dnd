When I was 3 ears old my parents divorced due to my mother cheating.  My mother left my brother and I with my father who raised us alone for 5 years.  When I was 9 years old, my mother came back into my life and was engaged to a new man.  At first, this man was very caring and loving.  He took us all to fun and interesting places and was always there if my brother or I needed him.  After about 10 months, I trusted him and it was then that things began to change.  I remember one time I was eating vegetables, and he licked ranch dressing off my face.  Another time I was practicing dance in my leotard and he adjusted the crotch of it, sliding his fingers underneath the fabic.  I never said anything to my mother, I don't know why. Things like that continued to happen, and progressively went further.  This man raped me when I was 9 years old.  I was laying in my mothers bed watching a movie, she had gone to work, and he came into the room and layed down with me.  He then started touching and kissing me and when I told him to stop, he pinned me down and raped me.  I screamed at first, crying for my mother.  Then he told me nobody could hear me so I cried silently until he finished.  I never told my mother until years later when her and her new boyfriend asked me about it.  I cried as I told her, and she simply said that there was nothing she could do about it now.  I am now 19 years old and what happened still haunts me every day.  I feel an amazing amount of anger towards my mother, but it seems as if she forgot about what happened and doesn't understand why we don't have that mother daughter relationship she wants.  Do I have a right to still be bitter towards her even though it is ten years later?  Sometimes I feel that I should have just let it go a long time ago.  /:
