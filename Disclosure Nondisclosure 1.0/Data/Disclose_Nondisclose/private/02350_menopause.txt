I am 48 years old. I had my first partial hysterctomy at the age of 39 (total vaginal prolapse) and about 2 yrs later removal of both ovaries. Before the last surgery, I had battled my weight for most of my life. In between these 2 surgeries I had a hiatal hernia repair with an esophogeal wrap. I had been fervently trying to lose weight and had lost about 25 lbs. and after the hernia repair continued to lose up to a total of 75 lbs. or more. I kept it off until my 2nd partial hysterectomy and it appeared that immediately following this surgery, I began to gain weight and levelled off at about 210 lbs. I now battle diabiets, fibrymyalgia, neuropathy, sleep problems, hypertension, high cholesterol and triglycerides. My pain is so severe that I am able to work and not much else. I battle severe emotional mood swings of crying spells that seem to have no reason at the base of them. Due to esceptoinally good bone density test restults, my doctor as not steered me towards any HRT. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME. I want to be in control of emotions. Life has not been easy, but whos is? I was widowed with 2 small children at 38 with small children 4 & 9. I remarried 5 years later and added 3 more children; however, the oldest was already on his own. The blended family has been the most difficult situation I have ever been called to be a part of and the battles often overwhelming to a point I cannot even begin to explain. However, I am committed. to be obedient in my faith to make this work. I just want to know what is wrong with my inability to control my emotions. Any answers?
