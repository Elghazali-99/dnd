When I started dating my boyfriend almost 4 years ago, I had no idea he had schizophrenia.  I didn't find this out until I was pregnant, and have, for the past three years been watching him get worse because his ability to cover up his illness and his tolerance of symptoms seems to be decreasing.  He sees a therapist once & awhile (every three months or so), which in my opinion, is not enough, but this therapist is more than happy to keep calling in prescriptions for him in some sort of attempt to help him. He currently takes zyprexa as he says that's the only med. out of a bunch he's tried that seems to help keep him semi-sane.  I've suggested that this isn't the way to treat such a disorder....today, he slipped up, I guess, and make a comment to me about the "watchers" (the people who are watching him, controlling him, etc...) and me "not believing everything they show" me....and it totally threw me for a loop because I guess I'm just coming to realize how bad his condition really is.  I'm starting to question whether I want to remain in this volatile relationship with our 2 1/2 year old, yet I feel guilty if I just say, "I'm out."  I need any advice, suggestions, etc.....thanks.
