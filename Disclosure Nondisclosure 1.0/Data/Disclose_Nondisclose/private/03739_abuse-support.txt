I am a 40 year old woman who is very alone and does not know what to do.  My life has absolutely no direction no meaning nothing I am only going through the motions as a shell.  My dad molested me and emotionally and verbally abused me when I was a young. beat my mome horribly as well in front of me and my brother and sister  I have no lasting relationships with men most of them are dysfunctional and I dont trust anyone.  I have no friends, I am a drinker I do not last at jobs and very low self esteem very defensive, you name it Im sure I am have experienced every emotion and experience of someone who has gone through being abused.  I want to know how I can get help.  I am seeing a counselor she is not helping me much I have been diagnosed with bipolar NOs or bipolar 1 I am currently not taking anything...due to the side effects of the last medication I was on.... I was told I need to confront my dad but i just cant!  I am to scared....my mom knows but has told me I should be grateful to have a roof over my head blah blah...and the fact they are supporting me right now since I have no job....not supportive mom right now....but I think... it is out of guilt....
