I am a 27 year old woman that is single and depressed. I was in a relationship for almost 2 years, my ex and I broke up because he was involved in criminal activity and moved away.  He was mad that I didn't move with him and he blames me for the relationship falling apart. Understand that I could not move away with someone who is in trouble with the law, there is so much uncertainty and he could not understand that.  He believed I stopped loving and that is not the case because I still love him. During our relationship there was so much psychological and emotional abuse, he would call me names, yell at me and tell me I wasn't good enough. I did everything for him, I paid his rent, bought his clothes,bought his groceries, gave him money when he needed it. I was there for him through everything.  Anyway a couple months ago I met a young man and instantly we clicked. He mentioned he had a daughter and I had a few years left in his accounting program.  I thought I met a great guy, then a week after we went out for coffee he told me he had a girlfriend but we could still be friends.  I didn't hear from him for another week, when he text me, he was  telling me how beautiful I am and how much he wanted to be with me.  We met again at his place later in the week and we had oral sex, I asked him about his girlfriend and he said the relationship was on the rocks and were not together. For two weeks we didnt really talk because he was always "busy", then he called me and told him he really liked me and we got together again and had oral sex again, two days later he sent me a text and said he wanted to work things out with his ex, I was crushed and I felt used. I told him how I felt about him and he told me only time will tell.  I didn't talk to him after that and a couple days after he called again just to say good morning.  I am really hurt by all of this, I really want someone in my life but I don't want to be used again.
