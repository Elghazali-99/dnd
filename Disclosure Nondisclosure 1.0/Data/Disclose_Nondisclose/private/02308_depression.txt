Hi everyone. I'm 17 and I think I am seriously depressed. Reason why I said "I think" is because I've never been to a doctor who confirmed it. I've been to a psychologist a couple of times but I've never let all of my emotions out. I feel like I am in a spider's web. No one knows what are my emotions, no one knows anything. Not even my parents. Speaking about my parents, the reason my depression got worse through the years is because I've been sexually abused by my father. This has happened ever since I was 13. The last time it happened it was in November 2014. My father is the reason I had problems with alcohol and drugs. I also used to cut but I managed to stop, even though sometimes I still think of doing it. My mother knows absolutely nothing and I'm scared of telling her or the police, cause I have no evidence. I can tell anything to the police, but if I have no evidence, they can't arrest my father. Yesterday I saw this video: https://youtu.be/8ayScvj0eFc (I'm a huge fan of the guy by the way, he does impractical Jokers.). I cried over the video for as long as I can remember... Wishing I could have him as a father. I don' understand why I can't have a decent father. Seeing father's with their daughters everywhere is killing me. I can't live a normal life anymore... I have no one except my mother and even her dosen't know what's happening in my life. I have friends who are not there for me. I'm... Alone. And I costantly think of killing myself and ending my life. The tought of being alone... of not having a father who can love his daughter like in this video is killing me and I swear to God... I'm hurt. 
I costantly speak to my inner twin which I call Dakota, I draw not to feel lonely... But nothing seems to work and I feel I'm going insane.
