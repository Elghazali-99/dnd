So I was prescribed Abilify 5 years ago. In that 5 years I have gained 80 pounds. Abilify can cause the development of diabetes.
 I have hypoglycemia which has been getting more intense. So I had a diabetes blood draw. 
 I was told today that I do not have diabetes (thank goodness) but that the Abilify shut off my brain's ability to regulate carb cravings. So now I am to take an insulin regulator drug. 
 My question is this: IF WE KNOW THAT ABILIFY AND OTHER PSYCH MEDS CAUSE CARB/SUGAR CRAVINGS THEN WHY WAIT UNTIL A PATIENT GAINS 80 POUNDS TO PUT THEM ON AN INSULIN REGULATOR???
 I moderate a mental health support group website. It concerns me to be reading about people like me, and there are a TON OF US, who have horrible weight gain from psych meds.  THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FAT AND HAPPY! My depression now is from being so fat I can't even walk through the mall with my daughter! My activity levels have deteriorated from being so fat, my back pain has increased significantly and I cannot seem to lose weight no matter how hard I try.
I am FRUSTRATED.
