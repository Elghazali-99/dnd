I am on day 2 of a very low dose of Wellbutrin (half of  a 100 mg tablet for a week, then going up to whole tab for week, then up to to two tabs...).  So far I feel my depression/anxiety has gotten worse. I know it has only been TWO DAYS on a very low dose. But this medication has worked for me before, back in 2009.  And I just don't remember any worsening before it got better, or honeymoon phase followed by a crash before it leveled out, or any of that stuff people have mentioned online.  I just remember feeling the same...and then better.  I certainly don't think it took weeks and weeks.  I SO wish I had keep a diary during that episode. (I am doing so now).  I wonder if my depression is just very different this time. It is very specifically to do with intrusive doomed thoughts about my daughter getting older (empty nest syndrome type stuff).  I am saddened (which makes me anxious) about anything involving children, toys, memories of her childhood, etc. I can't even walk through certain sections of the store without crying.  It just seems like such a SPECIFIC depression... and very much involving these intrusive/ruminating thoughts about mortality/aging.... so different from the last depression which was more about general hopelessness. Has the nature of my depression changed so much that the Wellbutrin will not work this time?  
 These are my thoughts after only 2 days, and I know I need to give it time. I guess I am looking for reassurance that it will work for me again. :(
 I suppose I have at least had an energy boost, but it is a jittery one that is really not so welcome. I don't need energy... just want to stop feeling sad (which leads to anxiety that I will never stop being sad). Vicious cycle...
