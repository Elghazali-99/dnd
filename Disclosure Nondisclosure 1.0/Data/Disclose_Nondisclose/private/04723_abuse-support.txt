Hello, I guess I should have been here sooner.  I was molested by my uncle off and on starting from age 4 until 8.  I have noticed (being an adult now) that I have suffered from anxiety since that has happened to me.  It used to be every time I'd go out to eat with people.  I had to run to the bathroom and gag, or throw up.  My mom couldn't take me anywhere to eat.  Now it happens to me when I go out to eat with new people, or sometimes with people in general, even if I have gone to lunch with them a million times.  Also, this happens to me when I get nervous about other things sometimes.  Its emabarrassing, and I want to stop feeling this way.  I have no idea what going out to eat or eating around certain people have to do with me being molested almost 30 years ago.  I haven't seen my uncle in over 15 years.  I can't even eat at my Dad's house during the holidays.  I try to avoid eating there at all because I gag out of being nervous.  It just feels like someone is choking me. Does anyone else have this problem?  If so, does anyone have any clues as to how to fix this?
