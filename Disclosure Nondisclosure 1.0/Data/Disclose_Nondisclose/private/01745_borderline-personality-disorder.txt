I have just recently spent the night in a Police Cell.  My partner was the one who rang them to say that I'd been making threats of self-harm.  I live on my own, but have had my partner and the people he lives with wanting me to stay with them because I'd recently overdosed and cut.  Unfortunately I know I am difficult to cope with and my partner was showing signs of his difficulty; which is why I felt it necessary for me to go back to my own flat.
I hate hurting people.
I do not get out much and do not have much of a social life.  At times I experience intense fear when I have to leave my flat.  I struggle making it to appointments - however a major point of fear arises regarding hospitals and police stations.
I was out of my depth spending time over-night in the police cell and felt angry towards my Partner for putting me through that suffering.  He knows I dislike going there as he has called on the police like this a few times now over the years.  He see's the distress I'm in after arriving back.  I am back round with him and my friends now, however it all feels wrong.  I am usually close to the people who he lives with, but they are behaving differently towards me.  I think they are trying to toughen me up as they are not being very attentive or empathetic towards me.
So here I am feeling more needy than ever; so I ask the question.  How on earth to I begin to cope with situation?  I am also still feeling 'shaken' up by my experience at the police station.
