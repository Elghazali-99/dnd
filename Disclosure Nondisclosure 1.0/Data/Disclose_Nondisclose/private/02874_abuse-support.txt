I met a man while, I was on a very sedative drug called mirtzapine.  This man came into my life, and cause I could orgasm, he pushed me down onto the bed, and said he had only wanted to be friends,  I told him, I couldn't be sexually with a man who just wants to be a friend, so he stayed with me and used sexual toys on me.  He had a heartatack, my son who has autism, didn't like him (I so should of listen to him.) I made the choice to ask for help and placed my son into fostercare, somehow the foster care got confused and made me out as abusive person. Yes I was on sedative medication at the time this man used me to build his business up, by me being free labour,  Yes I didn't know the difference about this man.  I also live an avm on the right side of the brain, where it's hard for me to feel pain at time, so this man sexual toy, placed pain on me to feel it as pleasure. Through the stress of the confusion from myself going through the court system, helping my son, and my partner torture, I had electrical shock pains in my head, and presumly I may of had a tia, but I never went to the hospital, as I was confused with the symptoms.  The partner left, also he had took my car, so I lost my independence with my car.  I did get stronger. I did fix up the confusion with my son, being in care and was able to get off the sedatitive drug  But I just can't get over my ex-partners sexual abuse/torture. Please help me forget this man and his torture from my mind, as i need to stop the control he put in my mind, in needing him
