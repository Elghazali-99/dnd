My ex-husband was have an affair I didn't know because he didn't change any of his ways with me! then 2 months before he filed for divorce he started talking about wanting a child! Well he knew I0 yrs. when we meet that I couldn't have children & he always said he didn't want any either! In the meantime my daughter from previous marriage had my first grandson! Well to make along story short he used me & my grandson to get out of the marriage !!! Only to get with his new girlfriend who is 42 , has 2 girls 9 & 12 , has been fixed!! I haven't heard anymore about a child from him ! After 4 months of divorce he is getting married to her, they are living in the house I worked so hard on fixing up for me & him! I moved out of town so I wouldn't have to see him & family & her! But I work in the local grocery store.His family from the day he filed for divorce stopped coming there & not one of them has spoke to me! Now they are starting to come back in to shop & are trying to speak to me and that hurts me because when I was going through the divorce no one had anything to do with me! How can I handle this because it is hurtful & I really loved his family ? I don't want to be nasty because that's not me! I just want to move on with my life !! Another thing his new wife to be has wrecker 2 other marriages and my ex-husband knew this because one was he good friends!  Give me some advise on how to deal with this mess!!!!!!!!!
