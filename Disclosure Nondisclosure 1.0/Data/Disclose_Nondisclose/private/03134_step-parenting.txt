About 6 years ago my husband and I got custody of his 3 children from his first marriage. Their mother has some substance abuse problems that were a challenge throughout the years and have now led to her being permenantly disabled in a facility. I have been the primary care giver for the three children since they moved in with us. Years ago things were very difficult. She would give me a hard time at every turn. Undermining me with her brothers, blogging horrible things about me, and finally coming to blows where she punched me and I was forced to call the police. At this point she tried to live with her mother. She eventually moved back in with us when things took a turn for the worse with her mother. Things seemed better for a while and then since she has been home for the summer from college things have been getting gradually worse. She has become nasty again, writing things on twitter about me, insulting me to her brothers, and just making things generally uncomfortable in the house. 
 These things are extremely hurtful because I treat her like she is my daughter. I always try to include her in things, take care of anything i can for her, take her shopping, get her nails done, anything I can do to help her or bond with her. Nothing has worked. I am at a loss what to do with her at this point. It causes fights between her father and I, makes me walk on egg shells around the house, and generally feel uncomfortable in my own home. 
 Any suggestions on what to do?
