Living with this feeling every day is so damn hard...I mean I can do it...but like it's so hard to explain. I know most of you probably feel similar in some way. Every night it's so hard for me to fall asleep...like sometimes not until 3 or 4 in the morning. I don't really eat a lot anymore, and I've always been kind of skinny, but still that makes it worse. it's not like I don't eat anything, I just don't feel hungry sometimes. And sometimes I have this feeling that no one really cares..and no one really understands..except other people who have depression. I know I'm not alone but I haven't met a single person yet who truly feels this. Like sometimes I really just don't know what to do...like right now...so I'm just lying in bed here thinking. I always over analyze things which makes life ever harder. Seriously when will this **** end I just wanna like be angry/sad at the same time....it's so hard to feel anything which really *****....I hope some people will tell me how they do it every day...
