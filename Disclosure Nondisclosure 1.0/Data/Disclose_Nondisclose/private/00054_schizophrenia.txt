Hello, 
 I am currently a patient of the Albert Road private psychological clinic regarding my mental state. I have suffered from anxiety for several years recently to the extent of not leaving the house except for school and so forth. My parents say I can become extremely aggressive at times. I swear at both my parents and my sister, only after my outbursts ( sometimes violent) do I feel remorseful. Just recently I Have experienced sensations under and in my skin, my hearing has become extremely over sensitive to the point where I cry when people eat around me. I have seen my dog several times although he was physically in the room. I have also heard male voices calling my name. Just days ago I was seeing stars ( the sort of stars you see in cartoons) floating above me and in the corner of the room. I really think there is something wring with me and I am positive that I am dying. My psychiatrist prescribed 50mg of seroquel, and 2*200mg tablets of tegretol. My eyes will not allow me to focus on one object without jittering around, please give me answers.
 Kind Regards, Jack
