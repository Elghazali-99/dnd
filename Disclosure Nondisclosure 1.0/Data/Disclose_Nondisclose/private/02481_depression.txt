hi guys :(
 my new dr got me off of effexor cold turkey. before that i was experiencing twitches that were so severe that i wouldn't be able to get a good night rest. after i explaining this to my new psych, he wanted to ween me off with prozac. for some time i started getting chest pains after taking prozac/effexor in the morning. subsequently, my dr ordered a full cold turkey off of effexor. that's when things got terrible.
 i was getting night terrors, night sweats, and then a full blown panic attack. 
 after the panic attack things weren't the same. the dysphoria never really went away, and it's been a few weeks. now there's a pattern of head aches ~6pm and i'm extremely irritable (way more than before)
 effexor did help with my depression and anxiety, but i experienced a lot of hypomania with it, too. 
 i hear any sort of manic trigger by antidepressants is now considered for serious evaluation for bipolar disorder under the DSM-5. 
 but i'm digresssing. i just want this to go away. i've been on effexor for about 4-5 months, and i also stopped prozac after the panic attacks which was not advised against my dr. being on prozac also didn't help AT ALL. How long do you think these symptoms will last and is it NORMAL to have head aches??????? It's been about 2-3 weeks being OFF of medications!
