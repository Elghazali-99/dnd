Alright. I've been desperately seeking an answer to my question. 
I don't know if i have just a weird *** personality or if i actually have a disorder causeing it. 
 I've looked through all the personality disorders and only some apply to me by my standards. 
 The ones that describe me the most are Schizoid personality disorder, but i do express my anger very well. Only my anger though. I have a really hard time expressing love, sympathy, happiness... things like that. The only thing that i feel really is anger and sadness. I get happy sometimes, but it doesn't seem to genuine. 
 Avoident personality disorder, but i do not feel socially inept. Actually i feel a but superior to most people. I'm just not comfortable with social situations or anything. I don't like it at all. I'm very withdrawn. I don't even go to my families birthday parties.
 Also Borderline personality disorder, but i'm not neaty at all, i don't even like having relationships with anyone and i would never feel neaty. I'm very independant. I would NOT like it at all if it was intimate. I would feel really sad if i got abandoned but i'm not neaty. 
 I'm mean but i don't think i'm too narcissistic. I don't really feel remorse. Cause emotions don't really register with me right. But i can feel remorse for my family but i'm still very foward with them and sometimes end up hurting their feelings. I'm kind of misanthropic. 
 Everyone says i'm just really weird. 
All of these disorders that i've written down, i have all the symptoms but the ones i said i don't have. I also recently found out that i have a INTP personality. I don't agree with some of it but it's pretty much me. 
 I'm confused. Is this whole thing just a really weird personality or do i just have some kind of disorder?
