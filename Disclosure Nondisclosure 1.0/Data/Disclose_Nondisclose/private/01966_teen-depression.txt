Okay i am not sure if this is the right place to post this topic.I need some insight on my problem.First off I am an 17 year old male.I guess my problem is that I cant control my emotions.I am way too emotional in certain situations.I would be calm one mintue but then I will feel anxiety building up and I would start to lose my composure(facial expression would change and I will get teary eyed)It would take a mintue or two to calm down and I would get my composure back(this usually only happens around social settings among people i dont know)This doesnt mean that i am afriad to talk to strangers because most of the time i am not.I make friends easily but i would say maybe one time a day i would just feel a burst of energy and get overwhelmed.I also get hurt way too easy.For exmaple, I was in a class and we were passing around papers.There was this girl sitting next to me and I tried giving her the paper but she seemed to ignore me and i just left it there.More papers came and this time I asked her "do you want to look through these papers"(to my surprise my tone of voice was very hurt because i guess i thought she was ignoring me)she wasnt she was just so caught up in her work.I acuatlly find that very amusing and I really surprise that i let that get to me.I am not really one to dwell on my problems i know everyone has them.I go to school,i work,i play sports and do the things i love. I probably already suspect whats wrong and it probably has to do with some self esteem issues and aniexty.
