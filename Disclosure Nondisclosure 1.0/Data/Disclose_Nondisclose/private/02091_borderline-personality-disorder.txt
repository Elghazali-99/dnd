Hi all, i'm 23 and my gf is 18. We have been together for nearly a year now.
 She has been out of control for the past few months. It started as an eating disorder, which turned into what we both think is BPD (she matches all the symptoms). Her rage gets out of control and many times she has verbally, physically and emotinally abused me. I'm talking about hitting, biting, scratching, spitting in my face, just to name a few. She's manipulative, possessive and always has to get her own way. I have been to therapy a few times with her at the start of our relationship, but that really just focused on the eating disorder side of things. 
 I try to talk to her about it but she always goes on the defensive and says i wouldn't understand. She tried explaining to me that she knows i love her so much, but she just cannot feel anything. She is emotionally drained all the time, just getting through the day is a struggle for her. She has talked about the mask she wears around family and friends, because she doesn't want people to see the 'real' her as she is scared they will walk away.
 She refuses theropy as she doesn't want to be officially diagnosed, she is scared it will go on her record and everywhere she goes it will hang over her as people will need to be made aware of it and think she is a freak?
 I want to be understanding of her condition so i'm not always taking things personally and learn how to deal with things a bit better.
 Any type of help and advice would be great.
