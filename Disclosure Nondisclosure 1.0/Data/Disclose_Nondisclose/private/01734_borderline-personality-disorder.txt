I'm getting really stressed because just recently I found out that my ex/baby daddy is a sociopath. 
 No he didn't confess this to me. It's pretty obvious. He told me when he was younger he used to torture cats, and that he had severe behavioral issues and that he had to go see a therapist. I figured it was just a rough childhood. Until he started saying stuff a few months ago like he wanted to know what it would feel like to kill someone.. And he says it so nonchalant... Like he really wants to know what that feels like.. and that just freaks me out and made me feel uneasy.. I tried asking his younger sister about him going to therapy and stuff but she acted like she knew nothing about it.. 
 Now here I am 4 months pregnant and I'm worried that my unborn child is capable of coming out with these same issues and I'm worried that there won't be anything I can do to change that.. I suspect that he comes from a pretty jacked up gene pool because he has a half sister who I believe is autistic.. I'm just worried I guess. I'm too empathetic to have a child who isnt..
  What are the chances that my child is destined to be the sameway? is there anything i can do to completely prevent it?
