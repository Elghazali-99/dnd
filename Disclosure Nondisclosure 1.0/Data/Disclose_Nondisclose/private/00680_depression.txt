I've always battled depression as far as I could remember (even early years of childhood). 
Lately it feels severe and at times too much to take on and I begin to feel l can't handle it anymore. I get to a dark place of wishing I wouldn't wake up the next day or something would just take my life but not necessarily about taking my own life. I care too much about my partner and my family to do that. 
I've been a walking zombie for about 8 months now, just sort of going through the motions of life but feeling numb and isolated, with no interests in anything. For the past two and a half months I haven't left my bed or my room. I get up and get ready for work or school but I come back home and get right back into my sweats and get in bed. It's my everyday routine. If I don't have a prior engagement, I'm in bed and some days don't even get ready or clean myself up. 
 I'm currently on Effexor 37.7mg (I was on a higher dosage but am being taken off of it because it wasn't working for me) I have tried many antidepressants but have pretty drastic side effects with all of them. 
 What I would greatly appreciate and desperately need right now is advice from others who have been through this or are currently battling this.  What do you do to help/get through it? Or, what DID you do to overcome it? 
 I'm at a loss. I have no drive or energy and I'm at the point where I can't even force myself to do things like go for a walk anymore. 
 Please help...
