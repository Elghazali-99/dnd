Hi, I pre-apologize for the wall of text. 
 I'm a 16 year old male in a white middle class family. But for the past couple of years, it feels as if my life is just drifting by. I've lost all passion I've ever had for anything. I'm incredibly burnt out in school, have zero interest in what I learn in, and my grades are starting to reflect it. I have a group of friends that care about me. My home life is what I consider to be awful. My parents care about me a lot, but I just can't bring myself to tell them how I really feel. I think they don't really understand what I'm going through, so they feel frustrated and start yelling. I look forward to nothing in life anymore. I have no goals or aspirations. The only thing I look forward to nowadays is the weekends, when I can go smoke weed, take some pills, or drink. I feel like my life is stuck in  a loop full of nothing. Every day is just the same old ****, and I no longer have the energy to go on and act like I'm fine. 
 I don't know what I should do. How will I finally be able to tell my parents that I'm depressed and on drugs? It'll break their hearts. I need someone's help...
