So I have diagnosed HSV2. I have a mutated form which does not respond to any anti-virals. I have been even seen at my state's university for this. I also ended up getting HPV. (Same partner) My HPV is one of the rare cancer causing HPV. I get paps a lot because of my HSV2. About 6 months ago my pap came back abnormal. This is when we found out about the HPV and it had to be send to the Mayo Clinic. Anyways, I ended up with LSIL and had a colposcopy. My doctor said to come back in after 6 months and we will do a repeat pap which I normally get them every six months at the least anyways. This was last wednesday. Monday my doctor's nurse called me and got me scheduled right away because my pap came back with severe dysplasia HSIL. I know what the terms mean. They did not tell me which procedure they were going to do they just told me I need to come in. I have two rare forms of these viruses. I know my body and I feel like it will just keep coming back. I'm sure I will be getting a LEEP but I dont think this is going to work. Honestly my first HSV outbreak lasted 6 months. I know that having the two viruses together increases my risk as well 2-3x more likely to develop cancer and faster and having the rare cancer HPV is against my odds too. Has anyone been in this or know what is going to happen next? Any stories? Is it not crazy that I went from mild to severe in 6 months?
