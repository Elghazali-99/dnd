Hi, my name is Meara and I am 14 years old, going to be 15 in March. I have been dealing with on and off depression since I was about 10. Then when I was 12 I had my first anxiety attack and after that I had anxiety attacks several times a day for about a year or so. Now, for about a year I've dealt with on and off derealization disorder. For those of you who are unfamiliar with this disorder, I basically feel like I am living in a dream, like nothing is real. Now, people always ask me this question; What causes this? Well, my answer is always the same... Nothing, it is completely random and I don't know why. People never understand this and I can see why. Anyway, those 3 disorders are coming back. I am a freshmen in high school and I am starting to get anxiety attacks during school. When I get one in school, there's nothing I can do but wait it out. But, basically every morning I have been feeling just detached from the world and my surroundings. I feel sad and hopeless, and on the verge of an anxiety attack. Even though I've been through this before, I feel like I'm never going to get better, like I will never feel good ever again. I forgot to mention, my depression is bipolar, I will be perfectly fine one minute, then the next I feel as if I am alone and hopeless. This really *****. I currently take 75 mg. of zoloft, and I have been taking that for like over a year. However I started at 25 mg. But, does anyone have any advice? Anyone who has been through this before or currently is going through this struggle? Seriously, any help is greatly appreciated. Will I get through this and be happy one day?
