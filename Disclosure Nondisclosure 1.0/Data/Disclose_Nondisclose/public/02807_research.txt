Research

Research is the process of solving problems and finding facts in an organised way. Sometimes, Research is used for challenging or making contribution to generalizable knowledge. We may have to find some new algorithms, methods or replicate existing method to against others by proving the facts. Research is done by applying what is known (if anything), and building on it. Additional knowledge can be discovered by proving existing theories, and by trying to better explain observations. Research should be systematic, organized and objective.
Researchers take part in field or laboratory experiments, reading relevant books, journals or websites, taking notes and making conclusions. Teaching and lecturing is only part of the job of a professor or researcher. When they are not directly teaching classes they are often working on academic research. Learning institutions can vary widely in what they expect from members of their faculty. Most expect faculty members to set up their own laboratories. They hire their own lab employees and obtain their own funding, often from more than one source. Academic researchers often compete for grants to fund research at their own university. The more money researchers can attract, the higher the prestige of that university.

The scientific method is the usual way of doing this kind of research. It is meant to improve understanding of biology, engineering, physics, chemistry and many other fields. With this kind of research, scientists can understand the world, and discover useful things.

Money for research comes from governments, private corporations, and charities. Some of these organizations combine research and development of new products and ways of doing their work.

Any research should be:



Research must be published so the world can learn from it. "Nature", "Science" and "Proceedings of the Royal Society", are general scientific journals. Many special journals are published.
