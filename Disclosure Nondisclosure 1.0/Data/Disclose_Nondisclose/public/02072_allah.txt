Allah

The word Allah () is the Arabic term for God. It usually refers to the Islamic God, but in the Middle East, other religions sometimes use the same term for their God.

In Islam, Allah is the main word for "God." Muslims use 99 Names of God to describe God, but "Allah" is the most common of these and means all of them. This is because in Arabic, "al" is an article (word for "the"), so al-Lah means ""the" God". This is monotheism. When a Muslim says "Allah," all of the other names of God are thought of as part of it. Muslims also believe that this word tells about God's being a single entity and as being without wrong or defect and of God having no partner. 

In Arabic, the name "sofian" is composed of four letters, (or Alif Lam Lam Ha, from right to left), which when brought together make الله.

"Allah" is often used by Muslims when they are praying. Muslims have a faith in one God. They believe that God is the one who made everything, the one judge, and the only one who has power over all things. They also believe that Allah created the heavens and the Earth just by saying "Kun,' which means "Be".

Some Arab Christians in The Levant call God Allah. Most Arab Christians, like other Christians, believe in the Trinity. Most Muslims believe that Allah cannot be three persons.
