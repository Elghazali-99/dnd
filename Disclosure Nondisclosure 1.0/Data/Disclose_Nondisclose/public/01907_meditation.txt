Meditation

Meditation is to try to get past the "thinking" mind, and into a deeper state of relaxation or awareness.
Meditation is a common practice in many religions including Buddhism, Christianity (sometimes), Hinduism (where Yoga is important) 
and other religions.

In Buddhism, three things are very important: being a good person, making the mind stronger, and understanding why people are in pain (Dukkha). 

Buddhist meditation is not just used for spiritual reasons. Research shows that Buddhist meditation lowers stress, anxiety and depression. 

For Buddhists, meditation is used to calm the mind so that the mind can better see the cause of pain. Buddhists believe that this type of seeing can end pain.

Most types of Buddhist meditation focus on something. The most popular things to focus on include the breath, love, other emotions, and religious images and sounds.

Christians sometimes meditate by thinking about small parts of the Bible, or by saying the words of a prayer to themselves over and over.
