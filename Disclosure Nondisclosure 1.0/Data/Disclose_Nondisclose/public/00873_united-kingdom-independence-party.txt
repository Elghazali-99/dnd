United Kingdom Independence Party

The United Kingdom Independence Party (often called UKIP, said "you-kipp") is a political party in the United Kingdom. Its policies promote conservatism, classical liberalism, libertarianism, national conservatism, and Euroscepticism. Their only real policy is said to be that they want the UK to leave the European Union.

The party was founded in 1993, and they first won seats in the European Parliament in 1999. They won 3 seats in 1999, which was increased to 12 in 2004 and 13 in 2009. It is now 9. The party does not do well under Britain's 'First-past-the-post' system of elections and only has one seat in the British House of Commons, although they received 3.8 million votes (12.6% of the total vote) at the 2015 UK General Election.

Supporters of UKIP mostly believe in the following things:


In 2008 UKIP banned people who used to be members of the British National Party (BNP) from joining. 

On 9 October 2014 Douglas Carswell became UKIP's first elected MP. Carswell quit the party in 2017.

In the May 2014 local elections UKIP 
got 30% of the vote in Sunderland. The party gained 155 seats in the country.

UKIP came third in the May 2015 General Election, after the Labour Party and the Conservative Party. The party got 12.9% of the vote and gained one seat.

In the 2017 general election, UKIP's share of the vote went down to 1.8 and they didn't win any seats. The next day UKIP's leader Paul Nuttall resigned.

There are currently over 40,000 people who are members of the UKIP. Of these, some are politicians. Thirteen of them are members of the European Parliament.
