First signs of recovery from horse flu outbreak

As of 1600 hours local time (08:00UTC) Western Australia became the first state to resume normal internal movement of horses. The decision to lift restrictions was taken after all horses known to have entered the state in the two weeks prior to the outbreak of Equine Influenza in New South Wales were tested and confirmed not to be infected.

Western Australian Agriculture and Food Minister Mr Kim Chance said "The 15 imported horses from New South Wales, three from Queensland and one from South Australia have now all tested negative to equine influenza..."

Mr Chance said that the restrictions on bringing horses into the state were still in place and that horse owners should remain vigilant about Biosecurity. Anyone traveling to WA that has been in contact with horses should shower, change their clothing and foot wear and disinfect any equipment.

The sports governing body in WA, Racing and Wagering Western Australia recommenced track work from 1600 with harness racing to resume Friday and thoroughbred racing to resume on Saturday at Belmont Park. 

Additional thoroughbred race meeting has been scheduled for York/Beverley on Tuesday 4th September. The cards for Belmont on the 5th and Northam on the 6th have been amended.
