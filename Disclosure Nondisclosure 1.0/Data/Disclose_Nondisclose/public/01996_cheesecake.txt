Cheesecake

A cheesecake is a dessert made of cream cheese (or sometimes ricotta), milk, eggs, and flour and usually has a graham cracker crumb base. The graham cracker crumb base is sometimes held together by melted butter. The filling is mostly cream cheese with some sugar to sweeten it and sometimes sour cream to make it easier to shape and fill the crust.

Cheesecake has a smooth texture, and comes in a variety of flavours such as strawberry, blueberry, lemon, and so on. It is often topped with fruit or chocolate.

The cheesecake is believed to have come from Greece. The earliest writer who wrote about cheesecakes is Aegiums, who wrote a book how to make cheesecakes (). Historians think that cheesecake was served to the athletes during the first Olympic Games held in 776 BC. However, cheese making began at about 2,000 BC, and anthropologists have found cheese molds dating back to that period. Alan Davidson, author of the Oxford Companion to Food, wrote that "cheesecake was mentioned in Marcus Porcius Cato's "De re Rustica" around 200 BC and that Cato described making his cheese libum (cake) with results very similar to modern cheesecake".

The Romans spread cheesecake from Greece to across Europe. Centuries later, cheesecake appeared in America, the recipes brought over by immigrants.

There is an all-garlic restaurant in Stockholm where they offer a garlic cheesecake.

Cheesecake may be thought as an American classic, but they have been popular through all ages. In ancient Greece, different types of cheesecake were popular.

Sonya Thomas holds the world record for eating the most cheesecakes in a given time. She ate 11 pounds of cheesecake in nine minutes.
