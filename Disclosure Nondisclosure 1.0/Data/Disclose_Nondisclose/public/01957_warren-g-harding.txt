Warren G. Harding

Warren G. Harding (November 2, 1865â€“August 2, 1923) was the 29th President of the United States (Republican Party). Before becoming president, he was a senator and the assistant governor of Ohio. Before he was in government, he was an important newspaper manager. He was the president starting in 1921 until his death in 1923.

After World War I, he was elected on the promise to return the United States back to normal. He supported limited government in the economy. During his term, he lowered taxes and believed that the economy should not be regulated too much.

Warren G. Harding made the mistake of appointing his friends to high political positions. In result, they corruptly abused their power for their personal gain and several scandals happened during his presidency (Harding himself was innocent). 

He died of a heart attack in 1923 while he was the president. 

His vice president Calvin Coolidge became president after he died. 

Historians generally consider him one of the worst presidents due to his lack of political skill.
