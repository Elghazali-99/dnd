Jay Leno

James Douglas Muir "Jay" Leno (; born April 28, 1950) is an American comedian, actor, philanthropist and television host.

Leno was born in New Rochelle, New York, in 1950. His homemaker mother, Catherine (née Muir; 1911–1993), was born in Greenock, Scotland, and came to the United States at age 11. Leno's father, Angelo (1910–1994), who worked as an insurance salesman, was born in New York, to immigrants from Flumeri, Italy. Leno grew up in Andover, Massachusetts, and although his high school guidance counselor recommended that he drop out of school, he later obtained a Bachelor's degree in speech therapy from Emerson College, where he started a comedy club in 1973. Leno's only sibling was his late older brother, Patrick, who was a Vietnam veteran and a lawyer.

Leno worked on late night television. He became host of "The Tonight Show" in 1992, when Johnny Carson retired. In 2007, during the writer's strike, Leno sided with the writers, although he returned to his show after two months (without the writers besides himself) so that his staff would not be out of work. Despite leading the late-night ratings, he was forced out as host of the Tonight Show in 2009 to make way for Conan O'Brien. On March 1, 2010, became "The Tonight Show" host once again, because of poor ratings with both himself and Conan O'Brien. Leno hosted his last episode of the Tonight Show on February 6, 2014.

He now stars in his own prime-time comedy show, "The Jay Leno Show", which debuted September 14, 2009.

He guest-starred twice on the "Nickelodeon" TV series "The Fairly OddParents" as the "Crimson Chin". His character's name uses the fact that Leno has a large and square chin.

Leno has been married since 1980 to Mavis Leno; they have no children, by mutual agreement. Leno is dyslexic.
