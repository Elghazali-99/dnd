MSN Encarta introduces wiki-like enhancements

, 

Microsoft's Encarta has announced the addition of a blog as well as some wiki-like functionality to the online subscription encyclopedia.
Encarta is welcoming revision suggestions from their users, but they have a disclaimer:

When the changes are implemented at "Encarta", readers can click an "Edit this article" link to have their contribution reviewed by editors at Microsoft for possible use. 

The web enhancement has introduced a minor security glitch for the subscription service. When trying to look up an article on Encarta as a non-subscriber, web surfers receive a teaser page suggesting the user sign up for a subscription . However, using the editor URL for the same article will get a WYSIWYG display of the article requested; a simple way around the subscription requirement .

In an interview with Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia, on Friday he suggested the two are not the same, and Encarta's model will not be able to do what Wikipedia does.
