Santa Claus

Commonly associated with Christmas, Santa Claus is mostly shown as a big and cheerful white-bearded man wearing a red suit with white trim. According to the American version of the legend, Santa, as he is often known, lives in the North Pole with his wife, Mrs. Claus, some elves who build his toys, and reindeer who pull his sled through the sky. [[Father Christmas, the Nordic version of the [[myth]], is said to live in [[Lapland]], [[Finland]]. He is also associated with bringing [[gifts]] to small [[children]] on [[Christmas]] by sliding down [[Fireplace|fireplace chimneys]] and [[reindeer]] pulling his [[sled]].

[[Santa]] was most likely created from different [[traditions]] and [[characters]] from [[European]] and [[Christian]] [[culture]], such as St. Nicholas, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Sinterklaas]], and others. There are many popular [[culture]] items about [[Santa]]. [[Santa]] is known as [[Saint]] Nicholas, [[Saint]] Nick, Father Christmas, Kris Kringle, Kristingle, Christingle, Santy, and many other names.

Santa is said to live in a small [[hill]] called Korvatunturi in Lapland, Finland in the Nordic myth. There is a theme park in Rovaniemi, which is near Korvatunturi, called Santa Claus Village. 

The [[saint]] who inspired the [[legend]] of [[Sinterklaas]], (and thus, Santa Claus) is [[Saint Nicholas]], who lived in the 4th Century AD and had a reputation for secret [[gift]]-giving, especially to the poor and needy, such as putting [[coins]] in the [[shoes]] of those who left them out for him.

He is also said to live at the northmost end of the world at the [[North Pole]].
