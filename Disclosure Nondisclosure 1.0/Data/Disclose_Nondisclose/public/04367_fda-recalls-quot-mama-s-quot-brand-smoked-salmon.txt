FDA recalls &quot;Mama's&quot; brand smoked salmon

A nationwide alert for consumers to avoid the 'Mama's Smoked Nova Salmon' product in 8-oz. bags was issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when the threat of contamination with Listeria monocytogenes was discovered.

Listeria is a bacteria organism which can be serious and sometimes cause fatal infections, particularly in the young, frail or the elderly.

Healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such a high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Symptoms vary with the ability of the patient's immune reaction, and could be life-threatening.

Consumers are urged to return the product, individual 8-oz. packages marked: "SELL BY SEP 17 2005 27183", "SELL BY SEP 18 2005 27183". They may also be in shipping cartons labeled: "09/17/05 SELL BY 27183", "09/18/05 SELL BY 27183" to the place of purchase for a full refund. Questions may be directed to the company's recall coordinator at (305) 621-7600 ext 211.
