It is linked from Lake Victoria to its headwaters by the Ruvyironza River. Lake Victoria is also an important water source. It serves as a fork to the Kagera River. Another major lake is Lake Tanganyika in Burundi's southwestern corner.

Burundi's lands are mostly agricultural or pasture. Settlement by rural populations has led to deforestation, soil erosion, and habitat loss.

There are two national parks: Kibira National Park and Ruvubu National Park. Both were formed in 1982 to keep wildlife populations.
