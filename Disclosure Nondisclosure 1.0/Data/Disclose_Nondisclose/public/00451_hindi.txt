Hindi

Hindi is the most commonly spoken language in India. It is the fifth most spoken language in the world with about 182 million native speakers in 1998. The Devanāgarī script is used to write Hindi. 

Hindi is widely written, spoken and understood in North India and some other places in India. In 1997, a survey found that 45% of Indians can speak Hindi. The most common form of Hindi is known as "Hindustani". It has taken words from the Dravidian languages of South India, as well as the Persian, Arabic, Turkish, English, and Portuguese languages. The Hindustani language is almost the same as Urdu, the official language of Pakistan; the main difference is that Urdu is written in the Arabic alphabet. Hindi and Urdu were considered the same language until Pakistan split away from India. However, to this day, both languages are mutually intelligible, meaning that speakers of two different languages can understand each other without knowing the other language. 

Hindi developed from Sanskrit, the ancient language of India. Hindi started to develop in the 7th century as "Apabhramsha", and became stable by the 10th century. 

Dialects of Hindi include: Avadhi, Braj, Bhojpuri, Bundeli, Bagheli, Chhattisgarhi, Dogri and Marwari. 

Hindi is also spoken with regional accents like Haryanvi, Rajasthani, and Bengali. Bombay Hindi is spreading because Bollywood films use it.

Some famous Hindi poets are Tulsidas and Kabir.

Hindi Diwas is an annual celebration on 14th September. It commemorates the law of 1949 that made Hindi the legal language of the Republic.
