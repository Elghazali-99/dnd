'Sahara' opens as top film in U.S., Canada

Moviegoers who pushed it to No. 1 with a reported $18.1 million take for the weekend ending April 10 at the U.S. and Canadian box office welcomed the premiere of the movie "Sahara", starring Matthew McConaughey and Pen√©lope Cruz. Still, the total was $10 million less than "Sin City", the top film of the previous week, made in its debut.

"Sahara" is described as an adventure movie with plenty of fun. McConaughey plays a tanned and fit traveler searching for a long lost U.S. Civil War battleship, filled with gold coins, and finds love in the process.
"Sin City", starring Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba, dropped to second place but was still doing well with a $14.1 million dollar sophomore weekend. Filling out the top shows: "Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous", which falls from #5 to #7 with more than $4.1 million "The Pacifier," which drops from #6 to #8 with more than $3 million; "The Ring Two", from #7 to #9 with $2.9 million; and "The Upside of Anger," from #8 to #10 with $2.6 million.

Ticket sales at all box offices showed a decline from last year for the same weekend.
