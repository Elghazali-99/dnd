Electrical engineering

Electrical engineers are engineers who develop (think and make) different things that use electricity in a helpful way. They fix or design new and better ways of using devices that use electricity.

Big subjects in electrical engineering include power generation, automation and control, semiconductors, and information technology (radio waves and computer). To meet new needs, electrical engineering produced new specialties, such as electronic engineering and software engineering.

Early universities taught philosophy and later science. As the industrial revolution approached they had to start teaching new parts of these sciences. 

When the industrial era began, we needed to study mathematics, physics and chemistry to help support it. In the late 19th century when electricity was used more, a new branch called electrical engineering was invented. When radio became important, many engineers worked at it, and their branch was later expanded to cover electronic engineering.
