Thanksgiving

Thanksgiving is a holiday in the United States and Canada when people give thanks. It is celebrated every year on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. In Canada it is celebrated on the second Monday of October. 

In 1863, Abraham Lincoln set aside the last Thursday of November as a national Day of Thanksgiving for the United States. American immigrants brought the customs and practices of the American Thanksgiving to Canada, beginning on April 5, 1872. The United States Congress permanently made the fourth Thursday of each November as a national holiday in the year 1941. In 1957 the Parliament of Canada made the second Monday of each October a national holiday. Thanksgiving was first celebrated to give thanks for the harvest.

The event that Americans commonly call the "First Thanksgiving" was celebrated by the Pilgrims after their first harvest in the New World in October 1621. This feast lasted three days, and—as accounted by attendee Edward Winslow—it was attended by 90 Native Americans and 53 Pilgrims. More people in the USA celebrate Thanksgiving than Christmas. Americans eat 46 million turkeys each Thanksgiving.
