Old Testament

In Christianity, the Old Testament is the name of the first part the Bible, the one written before Jesus Christ. The Quran calls the Old Testament the "Tawrat".

In Judaism, the collection of inspired books is known as Tanakh; scholars often use the name Hebrew Bible. Both Jews and Christians believe these texts to be holy. According to them, God inspired men to write the collection.

The collection contains different texts, called "books", about God, and the people of Israel. 

It can be divided into several sections: the Torah, the History of Israel, the Prophets and Wisdom books.

The first to have used this name (in Latin: "vetus testamentum") was probably Tertullian in the 2nd century. 

Different religious communities include (or exclude) certain books. The Roman Catholic Church uses the books that were included in Saint Jerome's Latin translation of the Old Testament (his works is called Vulgate). The Eastern Orthodox church uses the ancient Greek translation of Jewish sacred writings called the Septuagint. The Eastern Orthodox list of sacred books has a few more books than the Roman Catholic list. Protestant Bibles stick more closely to the books in the Jewish collection (the Tanakh) but list them in the order found in the Septuagint.

The books of the Old Testament in order from first to last are:

a - Orthodox version: There is an additional book called 1 Esra, this makes the current Ezra -> 2 Ezra<br>
b - Catholic and Orthodox versions; lacking in Protestant versions<br>
c - Can only be found in Orthodox version<br>
d - Catholic and Orthodox versions contain verses not found in the original Hebrew <br>
e - Lacking in Protestant versions
