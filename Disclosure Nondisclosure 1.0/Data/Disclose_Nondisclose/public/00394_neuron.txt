Neuron

A neuron (also known as a neurone or nerve cell) is a cell that carries electrical impulses. Neurons are the basic units of the nervous system and its most important part is the brain.

Every neuron is made of a cell body (also called a soma), dendrites and an axon. Dendrites and axons are nerve fibres. There are about 86 billion neurons in the human brain, which comprises roughly 10% of all brain cells. The neurons are supported by glial cells and [[astrocyter and tissues. They do not touch and instead form tiny gaps called [[synapse]]s. These gaps can be [[Chemical Synapse|chemical synapses]] or [[Electrical synapse|electrical synapses]] and pass the signal from one neuron to the next.

There are three classes of neurons: afferent neurons, efferent neurons, and interneurons.

Sensory neurons carry signals from sense organs to the spinal cord and brain.

Relay neurons carry messages from one part of the CNS.

Motor neurons carry signals from the CNS to muscles, motor neurons are connected to the relay neurons. The signal passes between the neurons via synapses. Synapses are microscopic voids between cells where chemicals are released from the axon terminal of one cell to specialized chemical receptors on the dendrite of the receiving cell.

Mature neurons never divide: that is the general rule. They do not do not undergo [[mitosis|cell division]]. In most cases, neurons are generated by special types of [[stem cell]]s. A type of [[glial cell]], called [[astrocyte]]s, have also been seen to turn into neurons. In humans, neurogenesis (the origin of new nerve cells) largely ceases during adulthood but in two brain areas, the [[hippocampus]] and the [[olfactory bulb]], there is strong evidence for substantial numbers of new neurons.

The largest part of the human brain by far is the [[neocortex]]. It has at least~10 neurons which stay with us from cradle to grave.
