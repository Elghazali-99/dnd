Vedas

The Vedas are the four holiest books of the Hindu religion (but the word "Hindu rel not religious book. Literal meaning of the word Veda is "Knowledge" or Gyan). They are believed to be one of the oldest books ever made by mankindation to the next, perhaps over thousands of years. The Vedas have stories about the Hindu gods, instructions for rituals, hymns, poetry, and prayers. The word "Vedic" means something about the Vas is called "Vedic Sanskrit".

Later types of Hinduism that are very different from the types of Hinduism that follow the Vedas respect them.

The four Vedas are:


Rigveda is the first of the four Vedas. Rigveda means a "Veda of praise". This Veda has several verses (hymns). These hymns praise a number of gods. This Veda is also the oldest Hindu holy book. Even-though it is part of the Vedas it is not of Indian origin like the other Vedas.

Yajurveda is the second of the four Vedas. Yajurveda means the Veda of the Yajus. Yajus were mantras sung during religious activities. Yajurveda is divided into two parts. The name of the first part is Black Yajurveda, called Taittiriya. The name of the second part is White Yajurveda, called Vajasaneyi.

Samaveda is the third Veda of the four Vedas. Samaveda means the Veda of sacred songs. This Veda also has many hymns. They were sung by the Hindu priests and other Hindus during religious activities.

Atharvaveda is the fourth of the four Vedas. Atharvaveda means the "Veda of knowledge".
The Atharvaveda holds key for the massive vedic knowledge on the sciences like medicine, sorcery and has many facts that the present generation is still trying to crack.
