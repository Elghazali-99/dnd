Sumo

In sumo, a wrestler ("rikishi") attempts to force another wrestler out of a circular ring (dohyō) 4.55 metres in diameter. Also, the "rikishi" try to use their skill to force an opponent to touch the ground with anything other than the soles of his feet. 

Sumo tournaments ("basho") take place in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya and Fukuoka. There are a total of 6 major professional tournaments (known as "honbasho") per year, in January, March , May, July, September and November.

A tournament normally lasts for 15 days and features matches from different divisions. The top 5 ranks are known as the "Top division", also called the "Makuuchi" (幕内) or "Makunouchi" (幕の内). It is fixed in size and always contains 42 "rikishi".

The ranks included in the top division are yokozuna, ozeki, sekiwake, komusubi and maegashira.

Sumo wrestlers ("sumotori") are ranked into a hierarchy based on win-loss statistics in competitive tournaments. 

Those who have earned the highest rank are grand champions ("yokuzuna").

Sumo has changed in modern times. Foreign-born wrestlers are part of the sport. For example, Konishiki and Akebono are Hawaiian-born athletes who earned places for themselves.

In 2008, Kotooshu from Bulgaria won a championship. In that same year, two top wrestlers, Asashoryu and Hakuho, were Mongolian. Hakuho won the Nagoya tournament with no losses, 15-0.
