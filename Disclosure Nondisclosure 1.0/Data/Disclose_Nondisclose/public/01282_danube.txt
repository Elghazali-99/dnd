Danube

The Danube (Latin name "Hister") is the second-longest river in Europe (the Volga is the longest). It is the longest river of the European Union. The river is 2,860 km (1,777 mi) long. Brigach and Breg join together in Donaueschingen (near the Black Forest) to "make" the Danube. The Danube flows through or makes part of the border of 10 countries: Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova and Ukraine. The river ends in the Black Sea through the Danube Delta. 

Bigger cities include Ulm, Regensburg in Germany; Linz, Vienna in Austria; Bratislava in Slovakia, Budapest in Hungary; Vukovar in Croatia; Novi Sad and Belgrade in Serbia. 

The Danube is named in many other languages: Esperanto "Danubo", Bulgarian "Дунав (Dunav)", German "and" Plattdüütsch "Donau", Greek "Dounavis", Ancient Greek: "Ister", Hungarian "Duna", Turkish "Tuna", Latin "Danuvius" or "Danubius", Romanian "Dunăre", Croatian "Dunav", Serbian "Дунав", Slovak "Dunaj", Ukrainian "Dunay".
