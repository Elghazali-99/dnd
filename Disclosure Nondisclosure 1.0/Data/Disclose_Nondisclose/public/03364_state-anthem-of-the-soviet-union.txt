State Anthem of the Soviet Union

The State Anthem of the Soviet Union was the national anthem of the Soviet Union; it was first written in 1944, and was changed in 1977. This song replaced the old anthem, "The Internationale".

Below is the Russian and the English versions of the lyrics; both can be sung to the music. For the official versions in other languages of the Soviet Union, see other language versions.

The 1944 text had three different refrains following three different stanzas; in each refrain, the second line was consequently modified with references to friendship, then happiness and finally the glory. In 1977, these refrains were replaced by a uniform refrain following all stanzas.

Translated by Paul Robeson:

Another version:

"Note: These versions of the Anthem are a poetic interpretation of the Russian lyrics rather than a word-by-word translation.'
