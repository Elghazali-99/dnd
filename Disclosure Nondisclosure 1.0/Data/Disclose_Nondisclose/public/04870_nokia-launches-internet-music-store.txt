Nokia launches internet music store

Nokia Inc., the international mobile phone manufacturer headquartered in Finland, has launched their own online music and game downloading service to the public.

They are hoping to challenge other phone manufacturers who offer similar downloading services and also other online stores such as the Apple iTunes store.

Along with this announcement Nokia also revealed they will release new handsets that are better suited as multimedia players.

Nokia's chief executive, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, said: "Looking into the future, we will deliver great devices, combined with compelling experiences and services, to make it easy for people to unlock the potential of the Internet."

The service, named the "Nokia Music Store", will charge between €6 and €10 for a game while a single music track will cost €1 and €10 for a whole album. The service will initially be available on Nokia's N81 and N95 models, but the media is anticipating the service to become available on more models soon after launch.
