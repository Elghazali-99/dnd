Stephen Hawking

Stephen William Hawking, CH CBE FRS (born 8 January 1942) is an English theoretical physicist and mathematician. He was born in Oxford. In 1950, he moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire. He is one of the world's leading theoretical physicists. Hawking has written many science books for the public, people who are not scientists.

Hawking was a professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge (a position that Isaac Newton once had). He retired on 1 October 2009.

He has a motor neurone disease related to his dyslexia, and because of that he cannot move or talk very well. The illness has worsened over the years and he is now almost completely paralysed. He uses a wheelchair to move, and an Intel computer to talk for him.

Hawking went to St Albans School, a local public school in Hertfordshire. At 17, he passed an exam to study at Oxford. He studied physics and chemistry there. Because he found it really easy at the beginning, he didn't study a lot for the final exams.

In October 1962 he started his graduate course at Trinity Hall. It was at this time that his illness started to show up. He had difficulties in rowing and then even simply in walking. However, he finished his PhD and wrote about black holes in his thesis. He then got a fellowship (a job as a university teacher) at Gonville and Caius College in 1965.
