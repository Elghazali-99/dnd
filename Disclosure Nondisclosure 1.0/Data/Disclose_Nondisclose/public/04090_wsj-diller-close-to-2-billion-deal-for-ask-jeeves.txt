WSJ: Diller close to $2 billion deal for Ask Jeeves

The corporate boards from both companies were in talks all weekend negotiating what appears to be an all-stock deal. If approved, the price tag would be a substantial premium over "Ask Jeeves" valuation of $1.4 billion as of Friday's stock market close.

The acquisition of Oakland, California-based "Ask Jeeves" by IAC would mean they own a known brand name and get a foothold in revenues from search engine advertising. The company also would become a direct competitor with companies such as Google, , Amazon.com and Microsoft who also have launched their own high-profile internet search engines. "Ask Jeeves" also owns other brands, including Excite.com and iWon.com.

Diller has built InterActiveCorp on the backbone of the cash generated by Home Shopping Network, a company he used to bankroll the purchases of a large portfolio of internet and electronic commerce companies. These include , , Match.com, CitySearch and the . 

He also bought and grew cable networks and Sci Fi Channel before selling them off to NBC Universal, of which he is the largest individual shareholder.
