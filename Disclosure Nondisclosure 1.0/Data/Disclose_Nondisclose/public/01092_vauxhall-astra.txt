Vauxhall Astra

Vauxhall Astra is a car produced by Vauxhall since 1979. It was first just branded as a Vauxhall, since 1991 it has also been sold as a Opel, a Holden and a Chevrolet. From 2007 to 2009 it was sold as a Saturn.

In 1979, General Motors, the owners of Vauxhall, decided to replace the Viva model (Kaddett in Europe including Republic of Ireland) in the United Kingdom in as Vauxhall's small family car. The model still shared its body with the Kaddett, however it had things suited for use in this country, i.e. the steering wheel on the right side so that owners could drive on the left-hand side of the road. In 1991, Opel and Chevrolet both binned the Kaddett name. Therefore, they adopted the Astra one. In 1995, Holden did that too. It was only in South Africa that the Kaddett name continued, and it was only on the Astra hatchback. In 1999, the year after the launch of the Opel Astra G/B, South Africa binned the Kaddett name too, leaving no countries/regions/continents using the Kaddett badge. In 2004, the Opel Astra H/C was launched. The sixth/fourth Generation Astra was launched in late 2009.
