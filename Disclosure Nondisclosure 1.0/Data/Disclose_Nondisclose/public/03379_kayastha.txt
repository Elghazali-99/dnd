Kayastha

Kayastha is one of the social groups of India. They have a long history. They number around 15 million people and most of them live in India.
They are the learned class of Kshatriya because they were descended from the marriage of Lord Chitragupta with goddess Irawati ( daughter of Lord Yamraj; a Kshatriya )and second wife goddess Nandani (grand daughter of God Surya ; a Kshatriya god).
So they are of Kshatriya varna, periodically rumoured by other castes who are jealous of them as either Vaishya or Shudra. it is not true they are brilliant upper caste Kshatriya people.
Hindus believe that Lord Brahma created the world. He then created 16 sons from different parts of his body. His 17th son, Shree Chitraguptjee, was created from his mind and soul. He is the only son to be made from the whole body, not just parts. In human form he is called "kayastha", "kaya" meaning whole. Kayastha's have two roles in the caste system, as Kshatriya (a warrior) and Brahmin (a learned person or scribe). The Kayastha caste is divided into 12 sub-castes.
