Islam and clothing

Muslims have different dress codes for different contexts. Conservative ideas of "hijab" require people to dress modestly both for outside and religious contexts. Clothing for everyday wear, inside and outside the house is different, and very much depends on the family.

Muslim men also have many rules about clothing the most strict ones involve gold which there are over 160 rules 

A mans clothing usually consists of a…

Dishdasha, the dress,

Bisht, the cloak worn over the dress, 

The Ghutra, the scarf on top of there head.

The Taqiyah, the hat to keep the Ghutra from falling off 

The Agal is the black cord to also keep the Ghutra on

Islam says that women should dress in a very special way. This dress code applies to women and adolescent girls, but not to children. Usually, women who travel to Islamic countries should also wear such dress.

In the very least, the garment should cover the shoulders. Long-sleeved garments (and trousers) are preferred. Use a headscarf to cover the hair (especially when you enter a mosque or other place of worship).
