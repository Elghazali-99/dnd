In Greek mythology, Artemis is the daughter of Zeus and Leto, and the twin sister of Apollo. Leto had to find a place where she could give birth to the two. This was because of a curse set by Hera, Zeus' wife, because she was very angry with Zeus. For this, Zeus raised an island that had been floating underwater and had not yet been touched by the sun's rays. The island was Delos. Leto gave birth there, while grasping hold of a palm-tree.
