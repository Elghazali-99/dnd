Clownfish

The clown fish is a kind of fish. Clownfishes habitat usually is a coral reefs. Clownfish live in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, from north west Australia, the coast of South East Asia as far north as Japan. Often, they live in a symbiosis with other animals, for instance the sea anemone. They live in anemones which are like plants under the sea. Anemones eat fish by killing them with their tentacles which are poisonous. Scientists believe that clown fish are protected from the poison because they are coated in a type of mucus.

Some kinds of clown fishes can grow up and reach 18 centimeters (7.1 inches). Sometimes clownfishes only grow 10 centimeters (3.9 inches). They can be orange, yellow or they may look a little red.

Clownfishes eat small invertebrates that are dangerous to the anemones. That helps the anemones and the clownfishes. This is called mutualism.
