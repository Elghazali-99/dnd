'Great' title for John Paul?

If recent trends are to portend the future, late Roman Catholic pontiff John Paul II may be known to posterity as "John Paul the Great."

A growing portion of Catholics, and even senior clergy, have begun to use the title, which has been held previously by only three out of history's 264 popes.
Pope Gregory I of the sixth century, of the fifth century, and of the ninth century up to now, have alone been acclaimed "Great" in church tradition.

Historian Robert Louis Wilken, writing in Catholic periodical "Commonweal" in 2003, "Greatness is as mysterious as it is elusive," alluding to the ambiguity of the criteria used in applying the title. 

For instance, some figures — such as theologian or the apostle , the first pope — despite their wide influence in church history, have not been granted the honorific by historians or Catholic tradition, while others relatively unknown today were indeed accorded it. 

Newspapers in Italy, the United States, and throughout the globe have featured the acclamation "Great" for the deceased pontiff. Catholic-oriented websites and online forums, as well, abound with the title.

The 's official paper, "L’Osservatore Romano", also echoed the "Great" appellation. 

Moreover, a Vatican homily text for Sunday, 3 April, contained a reference to the title. Though the honorific was ultimately not used during the homily's delivery by Cardinal , until John Paul II's death, it is maintained that Vatican documents can be considered official even when not read aloud.
