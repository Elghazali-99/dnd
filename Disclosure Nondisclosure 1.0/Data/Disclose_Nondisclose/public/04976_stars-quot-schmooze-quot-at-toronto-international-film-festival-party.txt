Stars &quot;schmooze&quot; at Toronto International Film Festival party

The Toronto International Film Festival rages on in Canada, as various companies and celebrities host parties. One of the largest so far was "eTalk Star! Schmooze" hosted at the former CHUM-City Building in the Queen West neighbourhood of Toronto.

Wikinews sent freelance photographer Robin Wong to this star-studded event, which included the casts of many of the movies being played at the festival.

The second day of the festival didn't stop there.

Toronto's Design Exchange museum and education centre hosted a party for the movie "Michael Clayton", for which George Clooney was scheduled. Earlier in the day, Sienna and Savannah Miller launched their new twenty8twelve fashion label at the Holt Renfrew department store, a classy, upscale Canadian chain.

Tonight actress/singer Hilary Duff is scheduled to host a party at the club This is London. CTV will host an afterparty for Matt Damon's documentary "Running the Sahara", and some of his "Oceans" co-stars are expected, including Clooney. Wyclef Jean and the African runners featured in the film are also on the guest list.

A One x One Benefit at the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts will see Matt Damon, Richard Gere, and Shakira. Gere scrambled up to Toronto today after appearing live on "Good Morning America" and "Live with Regis and Kelly".

A 2002 study by the Toronto International Film Festival Group found that the event brings CDN$67 million to the Toronto economy. With stars dropping CDN$5000 a night on a room at the Four Seasons Toronto, or $10K on a dinner at Bistro 990, the numbers quickly begin to explain themselves. Distributors spend $30 million on purchasing films for release at the fest, one of the top numbers worldwide.
