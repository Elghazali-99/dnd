Her parents are Muggles (not magical) though she is very clever and a very good witch. Her parents are dentists. Her mind is full of intelligence and her forte is the ability to remember all that she has read. Due to this, Hermione can ace her tests. Although she is smart, she also is brave and has street-smarts. She can be a little bossy to Ron and Harry. She cares about house-elves and has made the club S.P.E.W., the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, which Ron calls "Spew." Her appearance is made up of frizzy brown hair, dark brown eyes, and slightly freckled skin. It is also noted at the end of "Deathly Hallows" that she marries Ron and they have two children together. She belongs to Gryffindor, though the Sorting Hat thought about putting her in Ravenclaw. Hermione has a pet cat called Crookshanks. Crookshanks, in the third book, largely annoyed Ron, but then he started liking the cat.
