Vishnu

Vishnu is one of the three main gods in Hinduism and the supreme being in Vaishnava tradition. Vishnu is the preserver god, which means he protects the earth from being destroyed and keeps it going, according to this religion, and he has come to earth in nine forms (called avatars) so far, with one yet to come. His most famous forms are Rama and Krishna. Vishnu's wife is Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of fortune.

Vishnu is usually shown with light blue skin and four arms. He holds a lotus, mace (gada), conch (shankha) and disc (chakra) in each of four hands.

There are 10 Avatars of Vishnu (in the order they appeared):
Vishnu holds items in his four hands. He holds a conch in the lower right hand, a discus in the upper right hand, a lotus (flower) in the upper left hand and a mace in the lower left hand.

Kodlamane Shree Vishnumurthy Temple : of Serenity and Mystery, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is ancient Tirth Kshetra. Visiting such a Shrine away from the crowd is pleasing for the heart. There is no other place like this anywhere in Brahamanda
