Super Bowl

The Super Bowl is a special American football game played every year at the end of the National Football League (NFL) season. The best team from each of the two NFL conferences play for the Vince Lombardi Trophy, which was named after the first coach to win a Super Bowl. For most football fans, it is a very special event. 

Some people who do not like football still watch it for the commercials and the half-time show. The TV advertisements during Super Bowl are the most expensive in the world in per second value. Because the high cost of advertising companies usually produce unique advertisements. As a result, watching advertisements has been a well publicized event in itself.

The Pittsburgh Steelers are the team with the most Super Bowl Wins with six victories. The San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys currently are tied for the second-most Super Bowl wins with five. The Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, and the Jacksonville Jaguars have never played in a Super Bowl. The Kansas City Chiefs and New York Jets have not played in the Super Bowl since the American Football League (AFL) and the NFL joined together in 1970. The super bowl is for fun people.
