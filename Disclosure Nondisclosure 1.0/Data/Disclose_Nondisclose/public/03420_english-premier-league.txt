English Premier League

The Premier League ('The Premiership') (formerly called 'Barclays Premier League') is the top league competition for English football. It is above the English Football League (EFL). For historic reasons, a few clubs from Wales also compete in the English football system. One of these, Swansea City, has played in the Premier League since the 2011–12 season. Cardiff City also played in the Premier League in the 2013–14 season.

The competition started in 1992. 22 Clubs coming from the Football League First Division decided to break away from The Football League (now the EFL), founded in 1888. The Premier League has since become the world's most watched sporting league. It is the world's most lucrative football league, with combined club revenues of £1.93 billion ($3.15bn) in 2007–08. It is also ranked first by UEFA. This rating is based on performances in European competitions over the last five years. In this topic the Premier League is ahead of Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A.
