Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international organization of thirty four countries. Member countries of OECD all have a democratic system of government. They also accept the principle of a free economy. A country has a free economy, when its government does not control the economic activities of its citizens and companies. 

The OECD started 1948 as the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC). The Second World War had just ended three years before in 1945. Some countries of Europe came together to form OEEC to help each other re-build their industry and other things destroyed in the Second World War. Later on, some non-European countries also joined this organization. In 1960, OEEC changed its name, and it became OECD: the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The OECD's headquarters are at the Ch√¢teau de la Muette in Paris.

Right now, OECD has thirty four countries as its members. Twenty countries became members of OECD in 1960. These countries are:
