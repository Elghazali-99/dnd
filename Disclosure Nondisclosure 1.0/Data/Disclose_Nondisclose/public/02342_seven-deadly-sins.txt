Seven deadly sins

Some followers of Christianity say that there are sins that are the causes of all others. There are seven sins that they call "deadly". Although the Bible does not list the seven deadly sins, they are in the book The Divine Comedy.

Ranked in order (starting with the lightest and least evil) like in Dante's "Divine Comedy" (in the Purgatorio), the seven deadly sins are:


People see that some of these sins are connected. They have tried to put an order to them. For example, pride (love of self out of proportion) is needed for gluttony (the over-consumption or waste of food), as well as sloth, envy, and most of the others. 
Each of these sins is a way of not loving God and not loving others as much as oneself. Scholasticism developed schema of attribute and substance of will to explain these sins.

As previously mentioned, the Latin words for the sins are: "superbia, avaritia, luxuria, invidia, gula, ira" and "accidia". 
The first letters of these words form the medieval Latin word "saligia", whence the verb "saligiare" (to commit a deadly sin) is taken. Various mnemonic devices exist for remembering the sins in English, e.g. PEG'S LAW (pride, envy, gluttony, sloth, lust, avarice, wrath).

In the official Catechism of the Catholic Church, consisting of 2,865 numbered sections and first published in 1992 by order of Pope John Paul II, the seven deadly sins are dealt with in one paragraph. The principal codification of moral transgression for Christians continues to be the Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes, which are a positive statement of morality, and part of the Sermon on the Mount.

The opposite of these sins are the seven virtues (chastity, moderation, charity, zeal, meekness, generosity, and humility) in corresponding order to the above seven deadly sins.
