Harry also finds that he is not expelled for inflating Aunt Marge and Cornelius Fudge. The Minister Of Magic just asks him to promise not to wander into muggle London. Mr. Weasley tells Mrs. Weasley of Siruis Black's motive to kill Harry. When Harry overhears this he is told not to go looking for Black. Later in the book, Harry soon realizes why.
