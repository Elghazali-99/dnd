Marxist intellectuals support arrested FARC leader

Marxist intellectuals released a letter supporting both the arrested FARC leader Ricardo Gonzalez (also known as Rodrigo Granda) and the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Granda is the alleged adviser of the FARC.

Colombian authorities arrested Granda on Dec. 13, 2004. The FARC is accused of terrorism by the governments of the USA and Colombia. Their members are regularly searched by Colombian authorities. Worldwide, police agencies have an interest in FARC members because of their involvement in international drug trafficking.

The arrest of Granda has caused disagreement. The FARC accuses Colombian authorities of capturing Granda inside Venezuelan territory. Venezuelan President Chavez claims Colombia invaded Venezuelan territory and possibly bribed Venezuelan officers. Colombia says the arrest occurred inside Colombian territory and that Granda was moved to Colombia by Venezuelans. Colombia admitted the payment of a reward for Granda, but rebutted accusations of bribery.

Recently, the Colombian government released an official notice accusing Venezuela of accepting representatives of terrorist organizations in political events sponsored by official Venezuelan institutions.
